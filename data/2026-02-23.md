TL;DR: 提出新方法提高运动视频字幕模型的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频字幕模型在描述精细运动细节和避免幻觉问题方面存在局限性。

Method: 提出了一种自动注释流程，结合运动学和语言解析，构建了新的数据集KPM-Bench，并提出了MoPE算法。

Result: KPM-Bench包含精细的视频-字幕对、多样化的问答对，以及评估幻觉现象的评估集。MoPE算法能够从文本中准确提取运动属性，有效减少幻觉问题。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了运动视频字幕模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Despite recent advancements, video captioning models still face significant limitations in accurately describing fine-grained motion details and suffer from severe hallucination issues. These challenges become particularly prominent when generating captions for motion-centric videos, where precise depiction of intricate movements and limb dynamics is crucial yet often neglected. To alleviate this gap, we introduce an automated annotation pipeline that integrates kinematic-based motion computation with linguistic parsing, enabling detailed decomposition and description of complex human motions. Based on this pipeline, we construct and release the Kinematic Parsing Motion Benchmark (KPM-Bench), a novel open-source dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained motion understanding. KPM-Bench consists of (i) fine-grained video-caption pairs that comprehensively illustrate limb-level dynamics in complex actions, (ii) diverse and challenging question-answer pairs focusing specifically on motion understanding, and (iii) a meticulously curated evaluation set specifically designed to assess hallucination phenomena associated with motion descriptions. Furthermore, to address hallucination issues systematically, we propose the linguistically grounded Motion Parsing and Extraction (MoPE) algorithm, capable of accurately extracting motion-specific attributes directly from textual captions. Leveraging MoPE, we introduce a precise hallucination evaluation metric that functions independently of large-scale vision-language or language-only models. By integrating MoPE into the GRPO post-training framework, we effectively mitigate hallucination problems, significantly improving the reliability of motion-centric video captioning models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出3D-HIW数据集和CLUTCH系统，实现手部动作建模新突破。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有方法在文本到手部动作生成或手部动画字幕中的局限性，以及当代模型在捕捉动画真实性和文本运动对齐方面的挑战。

Method: 提出'3D Hands in the Wild'（3D-HIW）数据集和CLUTCH系统，包括SHIFT架构和几何细化阶段。

Result: 在文本到运动和运动到文本任务上取得了最先进的性能，建立了可扩展的野外手部运动建模的第一个基准。

Conclusion: 该研究为手部动作建模提供了新的方法和数据集，有助于推动相关领域的发展。

Abstract: Hands play a central role in daily life, yet modeling natural hand motions remains underexplored. Existing methods that tackle text-to-hand-motion generation or hand animation captioning rely on studio-captured datasets with limited actions and contexts, making them costly to scale to "in-the-wild" settings. Further, contemporary models and their training schemes struggle to capture animation fidelity with text-motion alignment. To address this, we (1) introduce '3D Hands in the Wild' (3D-HIW), a dataset of 32K 3D hand-motion sequences and aligned text, and (2) propose CLUTCH, an LLM-based hand animation system with two critical innovations: (a) SHIFT, a novel VQ-VAE architecture to tokenize hand motion, and (b) a geometric refinement stage to finetune the LLM. To build 3D-HIW, we propose a data annotation pipeline that combines vision-language models (VLMs) and state-of-the-art 3D hand trackers, and apply it to a large corpus of egocentric action videos covering a wide range of scenarios. To fully capture motion in-the-wild, CLUTCH employs SHIFT, a part-modality decomposed VQ-VAE, which improves generalization and reconstruction fidelity. Finally, to improve animation quality, we introduce a geometric refinement stage, where CLUTCH is co-supervised with a reconstruction loss applied directly to decoded hand motion parameters. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on text-to-motion and motion-to-text tasks, establishing the first benchmark for scalable in-the-wild hand motion modelling. Code, data and models will be released.

### [3] [LGD-Net: Latent-Guided Dual-Stream Network for HER2 Scoring with Task-Specific Domain Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17793)
*Peide Zhu,Linbin Lu,Zhiqin Chen,Xiong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的HER2评分方法，显著优于传统方法，提高了效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估HER2表达水平对于乳腺癌评估和靶向治疗选择至关重要。然而，标准的多步免疫组化（IHC）染色方法资源密集、昂贵且耗时，在很多地区也难以获得。因此，直接从H&E切片预测HER2水平成为了一种潜在的替代方案。

Method: 提出了一种名为LGD-Net的新型框架，该框架采用跨模态特征幻觉而不是显式的像素级图像生成。LGD-Net在学习将形态学H&E特征直接映射到分子潜在空间时，由教师IHC编码器在训练期间进行引导。为了确保幻觉特征捕获临床相关的表型，我们通过轻量级的辅助正则化任务，明确地将特定于任务的领域知识（特别是核分布和膜染色强度）纳入模型训练。

Result: 在公共BCI数据集上的大量实验表明，LGD-Net实现了最先进的性能，显著优于基线方法，同时允许使用单模态H&E输入进行高效的推理。

Conclusion: LGD-Net是一种有效的HER2评分方法，可以替代传统的IHC染色方法，具有更高的性能和效率。

Abstract: It is a critical task to evalaute HER2 expression level accurately for breast cancer evaluation and targeted treatment therapy selection. However, the standard multi-step Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining is resource-intensive, expensive, and time-consuming, which is also often unavailable in many areas. Consequently, predicting HER2 levels directly from H&E slides has emerged as a potential alternative solution. It has been shown to be effective to use virtual IHC images from H&E images for automatic HER2 scoring. However, the pixel-level virtual staining methods are computationally expensive and prone to reconstruction artifacts that can propagate diagnostic errors. To address these limitations, we propose the Latent-Guided Dual-Stream Network (LGD-Net), a novel framework that employes cross-modal feature hallucination instead of explicit pixel-level image generation. LGD-Net learns to map morphological H&E features directly to the molecular latent space, guided by a teacher IHC encoder during training. To ensure the hallucinated features capture clinically relevant phenotypes, we explicitly regularize the model training with task-specific domain knowledge, specifically nuclei distribution and membrane staining intensity, via lightweight auxiliary regularization tasks. Extensive experiments on the public BCI dataset demonstrate that LGD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline methods while enabling efficient inference using single-modality H&E inputs.

### [4] [Enabling Training-Free Text-Based Remote Sensing Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17799)
*Jose Sosa,Danila Rukhovich,Anis Kacem,Djamila Aouada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed a zero-shot text-guided segmentation approach using VLMs and VFMs, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have opened new opportunities for zero-shot text-guided segmentation of remote sensing imagery.

Method: Proposed a simple yet effective approach that integrates contrastive and generative VLMs with the Segment Anything Model (SAM), enabling a fully training-free or lightweight LoRA-tuned pipeline. Employed CLIP as mask selector for SAM's grid-based proposals and GPT-5 for generating click prompts.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) in a completely zero-shot setting. Generated click prompts for SAM using GPT-5 in a zero-shot setting and LoRA-tuned Qwen-VL model, with the latter yielding the best results. Demonstrated strong capabilities across 19 remote sensing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach shows great potential in zero-shot text-guided segmentation of remote sensing imagery.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have opened new opportunities for zero-shot text-guided segmentation of remote sensing imagery. However, most existing approaches still rely on additional trainable components, limiting their generalisation and practical applicability. In this work, we investigate to what extent text-based remote sensing segmentation can be achieved without additional training, by relying solely on existing foundation models. We propose a simple yet effective approach that integrates contrastive and generative VLMs with the Segment Anything Model (SAM), enabling a fully training-free or lightweight LoRA-tuned pipeline. Our contrastive approach employs CLIP as mask selector for SAM's grid-based proposals, achieving state-of-the-art open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) in a completely zero-shot setting. In parallel, our generative approach enables reasoning and referring segmentation by generating click prompts for SAM using GPT-5 in a zero-shot setting and a LoRA-tuned Qwen-VL model, with the latter yielding the best results. Extensive experiments across 19 remote sensing benchmarks, including open-vocabulary, referring, and reasoning-based tasks, demonstrate the strong capabilities of our approach. Code will be released at https://github.com/josesosajs/trainfree-rs-segmentation.

### [5] [VQPP: Video Query Performance Prediction Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17814)
*Adrian Catalin Lutu,Eduard Poesina,Radu Tudor Ionescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了 VQPP 基准，用于视频查询性能预测，并展示了其在查询重写任务中的应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Query performance prediction (QPP) 在信息检索中非常重要，但在基于内容的视频检索 (CBVR) 中却很少被研究。

Method: 提出了第一个视频查询性能预测 (VQPP) 基准，包括两个文本到视频检索数据集和两个 CBVR 系统。

Result: 结果表明，预检索预测器获得了具有竞争力的性能，可以在检索步骤之前应用。此外，还展示了 VQPP 的适用性，通过将最佳预检索预测器作为奖励模型，用于通过直接偏好优化 (DPO) 训练大型语言模型 (LLM) 来执行查询重写任务。

Conclusion: 本文为视频领域的查询性能预测 (QPP) 提供了一个有价值的基准，并展示了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Query performance prediction (QPP) is an important and actively studied information retrieval task, having various applications, such as query reformulation, query expansion, and retrieval system selection, among many others. The task has been primarily studied in the context of text and image retrieval, whereas QPP for content-based video retrieval (CBVR) remains largely underexplored. To this end, we propose the first benchmark for video query performance prediction (VQPP), comprising two text-to-video retrieval datasets and two CBVR systems, respectively. VQPP contains a total of 56K text queries and 51K videos, and comes with official training, validation and test splits, fostering direct comparisons and reproducible results. We explore multiple pre-retrieval and post-retrieval performance predictors, creating a representative benchmark for future exploration of QPP in the video domain. Our results show that pre-retrieval predictors obtain competitive performance, enabling applications before performing the retrieval step. We also demonstrate the applicability of VQPP by employing the best performing pre-retrieval predictor as reward model for training a large language model (LLM) on the query reformulation task via direct preference optimization (DPO). We release our benchmark and code at https://github.com/AdrianLutu/VQPP.

TL;DR: 论文分析了Liu和Szirányi的姿态识别方法，发现其评价协议存在缺陷，强调数据分区的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估Liu和Szirányi提出的姿态识别方法的评价协议的有效性

Method: 方法分析、混淆矩阵、学习曲线和数据集构建分析

Result: 发现存在数据泄漏，评价协议未能衡量对未见个体的泛化能力

Conclusion: 强调在基于视觉的姿态识别研究中，特别是对未见个体进行可靠识别的应用（如无人机-人交互）中，独立于主题的数据分区的重要性。

Abstract: This paper presents a methodological analysis of the gesture-recognition approach proposed by Liu and Szirányi, with a particular focus on the validity of their evaluation protocol. We show that the reported near-perfect accuracy metrics result from a frame-level random train-test split that inevitably mixes samples from the same subjects across both sets, causing severe data leakage. By examining the published confusion matrix, learning curves, and dataset construction, we demonstrate that the evaluation does not measure generalization to unseen individuals. Our findings underscore the importance of subject-independent data partitioning in vision-based gesture-recognition research, especially for applications - such as UAV-human interaction - that require reliable recognition of gestures performed by previously unseen people.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的长视频理解架构，通过自适应采样和压缩技术，在保留关键信息的同时实现高效的视频处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频主干架构的进步和大型语言模型（LLMs）的显著成就，分析长达数十分钟的长视频变得可行且越来越普遍。然而，视频序列固有的冗余性质对当代最先进的模型提出了重大挑战。这些挑战主要来自两个方面：1）在内存限制内有效地纳入更多帧，2）从大量输入数据中提取判别信息。

Method: 提出了一种基于信息密度自适应视频采样器（AVS）和基于自动编码器的时空视频压缩器（SVC），与多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）集成的新型端到端架构。

Result: 该系统自适应且有效地从不同长度的视频序列中捕获关键信息，同时实现高压缩率并保留关键判别信息。在多个基准测试中表现出色，特别是在长视频理解和标准视频理解基准测试中。

Conclusion: 该框架在处理长期视频序列的复杂性方面表现出良好的适应性和有效性，证明了该方法的多功能和效率。

Abstract: With recent advancements in video backbone architectures, combined with the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs), the analysis of long-form videos spanning tens of minutes has become both feasible and increasingly prevalent. However, the inherently redundant nature of video sequences poses significant challenges for contemporary state-of-the-art models. These challenges stem from two primary aspects: 1) efficiently incorporating a larger number of frames within memory constraints, and 2) extracting discriminative information from the vast volume of input data. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end schema for long-form video understanding, which includes an information-density-based adaptive video sampler (AVS) and an autoencoder-based spatiotemporal video compressor (SVC) integrated with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our proposed system offers two major advantages: it adaptively and effectively captures essential information from video sequences of varying durations, and it achieves high compression rates while preserving crucial discriminative information. The proposed framework demonstrates promising performance across various benchmarks, excelling in both long-form video understanding tasks and standard video understanding benchmarks. These results underscore the versatility and efficacy of our approach, particularly in managing the complexities of prolonged video sequences.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made substantial progress across a wide range of visual question answering benchmarks, spanning visual reasoning, document understanding, and multimodal dialogue. These improvements are evident in a wide range of VLMs built on a variety of base models, alignment architectures, and training data. However, recent works show that these models trail behind in traditional image classification benchmarks, which test fine-grained visual knowledge. We test a large number of recent VLMs on fine-grained classification benchmarks and identify potential factors in the disconnect between fine-grained knowledge and other vision benchmarks. Through a series of ablation experiments, we find that using a better LLM improves all benchmark scores equally, while a better vision encoder disproportionately improves fine-grained classification performance. Furthermore, we find that the pretraining stage is also vital to fine-grained performance, particularly when the language model weights are unfrozen during pretraining. These insights pave the way for enhancing fine-grained visual understanding and vision-centric capabilities in VLMs.

TL;DR: 通过结合稀疏多模态范围测量，提高基于扩散的单图像新视图合成的质量和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决基于扩散的单图像新视图合成的局限性，特别是深度估计的可靠性问题。

Method: 引入一个利用稀疏多模态范围测量的多模态深度重建框架，使用局部高斯过程公式在角域中对深度进行建模。

Result: 实验表明，使用基于稀疏范围的重构代替仅视觉的深度估计，在单图像新视图视频生成中显著提高了几何一致性和视觉质量。

Conclusion: 多模态深度重建对于基于扩散的新视图合成至关重要，即使在极端稀疏的条件下，多模态传感也能带来实际效益。

Abstract: Diffusion-based approaches have recently demonstrated strong performance for single-image novel view synthesis by conditioning generative models on geometry inferred from monocular depth estimation. However, in practice, the quality and consistency of the synthesized views are fundamentally limited by the reliability of the underlying depth estimates, which are often fragile under low texture, adverse weather, and occlusion-heavy real-world conditions. In this work, we show that incorporating sparse multimodal range measurements provides a simple yet effective way to overcome these limitations. We introduce a multimodal depth reconstruction framework that leverages extremely sparse range sensing data, such as automotive radar or LiDAR, to produce dense depth maps that serve as robust geometric conditioning for diffusion-based novel view synthesis. Our approach models depth in an angular domain using a localized Gaussian Process formulation, enabling computationally efficient inference while explicitly quantifying uncertainty in regions with limited observations. The reconstructed depth and uncertainty are used as a drop-in replacement for monocular depth estimators in existing diffusion-based rendering pipelines, without modifying the generative model itself. Experiments on real-world multimodal driving scenes demonstrate that replacing vision-only depth with our sparse range-based reconstruction substantially improves both geometric consistency and visual quality in single-image novel-view video generation. These results highlight the importance of reliable geometric priors for diffusion-based view synthesis and demonstrate the practical benefits of multimodal sensing even at extreme levels of sparsity.

### [10] [ZACH-ViT: Regime-Dependent Inductive Bias in Compact Vision Transformers for Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17929)
*Athanasios Angelakis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZACH-ViT是一种紧凑的视觉Transformer，在医学成像任务中表现出色，适用于资源受限的环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对自然图像中视觉Transformer的固定空间先验可能阻碍泛化的问题，特别是在医学成像和边缘部署的临床系统中，提出了一种新的视觉Transformer架构。

Method: 引入了ZACH-ViT（零令牌自适应紧凑分层视觉Transformer），这是一种紧凑的视觉Transformer，通过全局平均池化在补丁表示上实现排列不变性，并移除了位置嵌入和[CLS]标记。

Result: 在七个MedMNIST数据集上进行了评估，包括二分类和多分类任务，结果表明ZACH-ViT在BloodMNIST上表现出最强优势，在PathMNIST上与TransMIL保持竞争力，但在具有强烈解剖先验的数据集上相对优势降低。

Conclusion: ZACH-ViT在资源受限的临床环境中具有竞争力，同时保持了亚秒级的推理时间。

Abstract: Vision Transformers rely on positional embeddings and class tokens that encode fixed spatial priors. While effective for natural images, these priors may hinder generalization when spatial layout is weakly informative or inconsistent, a frequent condition in medical imaging and edge-deployed clinical systems. We introduce ZACH-ViT (Zero-token Adaptive Compact Hierarchical Vision Transformer), a compact Vision Transformer that removes both positional embeddings and the [CLS] token, achieving permutation invariance through global average pooling over patch representations. The term "Zero-token" specifically refers to removing the dedicated [CLS] aggregation token and positional embeddings; patch tokens remain unchanged and are processed normally. Adaptive residual projections preserve training stability in compact configurations while maintaining a strict parameter budget.
  Evaluation is performed across seven MedMNIST datasets spanning binary and multi-class tasks under a strict few-shot protocol (50 samples per class, fixed hyperparameters, five random seeds). The empirical analysis demonstrates regime-dependent behavior: ZACH-ViT (0.25M parameters, trained from scratch) achieves its strongest advantage on BloodMNIST and remains competitive with TransMIL on PathMNIST, while its relative advantage decreases on datasets with strong anatomical priors (OCTMNIST, OrganAMNIST), consistent with the architectural hypothesis. These findings support the view that aligning architectural inductive bias with data structure can be more important than pursuing universal benchmark dominance. Despite its minimal size and lack of pretraining, ZACH-ViT achieves competitive performance while maintaining sub-second inference times, supporting deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. Code and models are available at https://github.com/Bluesman79/ZACH-ViT.

*Xuting Lan,Mingliang Zhou,Xuekai Wei,Jielu Yan,Yueting Huang,Huayan Pu,Jun Luo,Weijia Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于记忆机制的图像质量评估框架MQAF，在多个数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有全参考图像质量评估（FR-IQA）方法受限于参考图像质量，限制了实际应用。受人类视觉系统长期记忆存储能力的启发，提出了一种记忆驱动质量感知框架（MQAF）。

Method: MQAF通过建立记忆库存储扭曲模式，动态切换双模式质量评估策略以减少对高质量参考图像的依赖。当有参考图像时，通过自适应加权参考信息并与记忆库中存储的扭曲模式进行比较来获取参考引导的质量评分。当没有参考图像时，框架依赖于记忆库中的扭曲模式来推断图像质量，实现无参考质量评估（NR-IQA）。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个数据集上优于最先进的方法，同时适应无参考和全参考任务。

Conclusion: MQAF通过记忆机制提高了图像质量评估的准确性和适用性，为实际应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) methods achieve high-precision evaluation by analysing feature differences between reference and distorted images. However, their performance is constrained by the quality of the reference image, which limits real-world applications where ideal reference sources are unavailable. Notably, the human visual system has the ability to accumulate visual memory, allowing image quality assessment on the basis of long-term memory storage. Inspired by this biological memory mechanism, we propose a memory-driven quality-aware framework (MQAF), which establishes a memory bank for storing distortion patterns and dynamically switches between dual-mode quality assessment strategies to reduce reliance on high-quality reference images. When reference images are available, MQAF obtains reference-guided quality scores by adaptively weighting reference information and comparing the distorted image with stored distortion patterns in the memory bank. When the reference image is absent, the framework relies on distortion patterns in the memory bank to infer image quality, enabling no-reference quality assessment (NR-IQA). The experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple datasets while adapting to both no-reference and full-reference tasks.

Result: MUTrack achieves up to 8.40% higher AUC and 7.80% higher precision than the strongest SOTA baselines while running at 24 FPS. Establish a new foundation for scalable, multimodally trained yet practically deployable underwater tracking.

Conclusion: MUOT_3M and MUTrack improve underwater object tracking and establish a new benchmark for the field.

Abstract: Underwater Object Tracking (UOT) is crucial for efficient marine robotics, large scale ecological monitoring, and ocean exploration; however, progress has been hindered by the scarcity of large, multimodal, and diverse datasets. Existing benchmarks remain small and RGB only, limiting robustness under severe color distortion, turbidity, and low visibility conditions. We introduce MUOT_3M, the first pseudo multimodal UOT benchmark comprising 3 million frames from 3,030 videos (27.8h) annotated with 32 tracking attributes, 677 fine grained classes, and synchronized RGB, estimated enhanced RGB, estimated depth, and language modalities validated by a marine biologist. Building upon MUOT_3M, we propose MUTrack, a SAM-based multimodal to unimodal tracker featuring visual geometric alignment, vision language fusion, and four level knowledge distillation that transfers multimodal knowledge into a unimodal student model. Extensive evaluations across five UOT benchmarks demonstrate that MUTrack achieves up to 8.40% higher AUC and 7.80% higher precision than the strongest SOTA baselines while running at 24 FPS. MUOT_3M and MUTrack establish a new foundation for scalable, multimodally trained yet practically deployable underwater tracking.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于LLM的情感视觉定制方法，通过多模态LLM有效地修改图像的情感，证明了情感信息在L-AVC中的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以前的研究主要依赖于各种控制信号（如语言、布局和Canny）与编辑图像之间的客观对齐，这很大程度上忽略了主观情感内容，更重要的是缺乏通用的情感视觉定制基础模型。

Method: 提出了一种基于LLM的情感视觉定制（L-AVC）任务，该任务侧重于通过多模态LLM生成图像，修改其主观情感。进一步提出了一种高效和精确的情感操纵方法，包括一个高效的跨情感转换模块和一个精确的外部情感保留模块。

Result: 在构建的L-AVC数据集上的综合实验评估表明，所提出的EPEM方法在L-AVC任务上相对于几个最先进的基线具有显著优势。这证明了情感信息对L-AVC的重要性以及EPEM在高效和精确操纵此类信息方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于LLM的情感视觉定制方法，通过多模态LLM有效地修改图像的情感，证明了情感信息在L-AVC中的重要性。

Abstract: Previous studies on visual customization primarily rely on the objective alignment between various control signals (e.g., language, layout and canny) and the edited images, which largely ignore the subjective emotional contents, and more importantly lack general-purpose foundation models for affective visual customization. With this in mind, this paper proposes an LLM-centric Affective Visual Customization (L-AVC) task, which focuses on generating images within modifying their subjective emotions via Multimodal LLM. Further, this paper contends that how to make the model efficiently align emotion conversion in semantics (named inter-emotion semantic conversion) and how to precisely retain emotion-agnostic contents (named exter-emotion semantic retaining) are rather important and challenging in this L-AVC task. To this end, this paper proposes an Efficient and Precise Emotion Manipulating approach for editing subjective emotions in images. Specifically, an Efficient Inter-emotion Converting (EIC) module is tailored to make the LLM efficiently align emotion conversion in semantics before and after editing, followed by a Precise Exter-emotion Retaining (PER) module to precisely retain the emotion-agnostic contents. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on our constructed L-AVC dataset demonstrate the great advantage of the proposed EPEM approach to the L-AVC task over several state-of-the-art baselines. This justifies the importance of emotion information for L-AVC and the effectiveness of EPEM in efficiently and precisely manipulating such information.

Motivation: 针对现有安全视频理解（SVU）研究主要集中于检测和定位视频中的威胁（如枪击、抢劫）而缺乏有效生成和评估威胁原因的能力，本文提出了一个名为深度安全视频理解（DeepSVU）的新聊天范式。

Method: 提出了一种新的统一物理世界正则化MoE（UPRM）方法，包括统一物理世界增强MoE（UPE）块和物理世界权衡正则化器（PTR）。

Conclusion: 粗到细的物理世界信息在DeepSVU任务中至关重要，本文提出的UPRM方法在捕捉此类信息方面非常有效。

Abstract: In the literature, prior research on Security-oriented Video Understanding (SVU) has predominantly focused on detecting and localize the threats (e.g., shootings, robberies) in videos, while largely lacking the effective capability to generate and evaluate the threat causes. Motivated by these gaps, this paper introduces a new chat paradigm SVU task, i.e., In-depth Security-oriented Video Understanding (DeepSVU), which aims to not only identify and locate the threats but also attribute and evaluate the causes threatening segments. Furthermore, this paper reveals two key challenges in the proposed task: 1) how to effectively model the coarse-to-fine physical-world information (e.g., human behavior, object interactions and background context) to boost the DeepSVU task; and 2) how to adaptively trade off these factors. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a new Unified Physical-world Regularized MoE (UPRM) approach. Specifically, UPRM incorporates two key components: the Unified Physical-world Enhanced MoE (UPE) Block and the Physical-world Trade-off Regularizer (PTR), to address the above two challenges, respectively. Extensive experiments conduct on our DeepSVU instructions datasets (i.e., UCF-C instructions and CUVA instructions) demonstrate that UPRM outperforms several advanced Video-LLMs as well as non-VLM approaches. Such information.These justify the importance of the coarse-to-fine physical-world information in the DeepSVU task and demonstrate the effectiveness of our UPRM in capturing such information.

Motivation: 为了提高VLA模型的表现力，现有方法通常需要额外的观察线索或模块，这增加了数据收集和训练成本。

Method: 提出了一种名为Uncertainty-aware Observation Reinjection (UAOR)的无需训练的模块，该模块可以插入到VLA模型中，通过在当前语言模型层表现出高不确定性时，将关键观察信息重新注入下一层的Feed-Forward Network (FFN)。

Result: 在模拟和现实任务中，UAOR方法在提高VLA模型性能方面表现优异，且开销最小，无需额外的观察线索或模块。

Conclusion: UAOR是一种高效、无需训练、易于插入的模块，可以显著提高VLA模型的性能，且具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as backbones to map images and instructions to actions, demonstrating remarkable potential for generalizable robotic manipulation. To enhance performance, existing methods often incorporate extra observation cues (e.g., depth maps, point clouds) or auxiliary modules (e.g., object detectors, encoders) to enable more precise and reliable task execution, yet these typically require costly data collection and additional training. Inspired by the finding that Feed-Forward Network (FFN) in language models can act as "key-value memory", we propose Uncertainty-aware Observation Reinjection (UAOR), an effective, training-free and plug-and-play module for VLA models. Specifically, when the current language model layer exhibits high uncertainty, measured by Action Entropy, it reinjects key observation information into the next layer's Feed-Forward Network (FFN) through attention retrieval. This mechanism helps VLAs better attend to observations during inference, enabling more confident and faithful action generation. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently improves diverse VLA models across simulation and real-world tasks with minimal overhead. Notably, UAOR eliminates the need for additional observation cues or modules, making it a versatile and practical plug-in for existing VLA pipelines.

TL;DR: DCAG improves editing fidelity in DiT-based image editing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training-free control over editing intensity is critical for diffusion-based image editing models built on the Diffusion Transformer architecture.

Method: Proposing Dual-Channel Attention Guidance (DCAG) to manipulate both the Key and Value channels in DiT's multi-modal attention layers.

Result: DCAG outperforms Key-only guidance in editing tasks, with significant improvements in object deletion and addition.

Conclusion: DCAG is a training-free framework that enhances editing fidelity in diffusion-based image editing models.

Abstract: Training-free control over editing intensity is a critical requirement for diffusion-based image editing models built on the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. Existing attention manipulation methods focus exclusively on the Key space to modulate attention routing, leaving the Value space -- which governs feature aggregation -- entirely unexploited. In this paper, we first reveal that both Key and Value projections in DiT's multi-modal attention layers exhibit a pronounced bias-delta structure, where token embeddings cluster tightly around a layer-specific bias vector. Building on this observation, we propose Dual-Channel Attention Guidance (DCAG), a training-free framework that simultaneously manipulates both the Key channel (controlling where to attend) and the Value channel (controlling what to aggregate). We provide a theoretical analysis showing that the Key channel operates through the nonlinear softmax function, acting as a coarse control knob, while the Value channel operates through linear weighted summation, serving as a fine-grained complement. Together, the two-dimensional parameter space $(δ_k, δ_v)$ enables more precise editing-fidelity trade-offs than any single-channel method. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark (700 images, 10 editing categories) demonstrate that DCAG consistently outperforms Key-only guidance across all fidelity metrics, with the most significant improvements observed in localized editing tasks such as object deletion (4.9% LPIPS reduction) and object addition (3.2% LPIPS reduction).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别新颖动作类别，使用少量标记视频，动作名称的语义上下文有限，无法提供足够的背景知识来捕捉动作中的新颖时空概念。

Method: 提出DiST框架，使用大型语言模型提供的解耦时空知识来学习多粒度原型，包括分解阶段和融合阶段。在分解阶段，将动作名称分解为各种时空属性描述。在融合阶段，提出空间/时间知识补偿器（SKC/TKC）来发现判别性物体级和帧级原型。

Result: 在五个标准FSAR数据集上达到最先进的结果。

Conclusion: DiST在Few-Shot Action Recognition任务上表现出色，能够有效捕捉动作中的时空细节和模式。

Abstract: Few-Shot Action Recognition (FSAR) is a challenging task that requires recognizing novel action categories with a few labeled videos. Recent works typically apply semantically coarse category names as auxiliary contexts to guide the learning of discriminative visual features. However, such context provided by the action names is too limited to provide sufficient background knowledge for capturing novel spatial and temporal concepts in actions. In this paper, we propose DiST, an innovative Decomposition-incorporation framework for FSAR that makes use of decoupled Spatial and Temporal knowledge provided by large language models to learn expressive multi-granularity prototypes. In the decomposition stage, we decouple vanilla action names into diverse spatio-temporal attribute descriptions (action-related knowledge). Such commonsense knowledge complements semantic contexts from spatial and temporal perspectives. In the incorporation stage, we propose Spatial/Temporal Knowledge Compensators (SKC/TKC) to discover discriminative object-level and frame-level prototypes, respectively. In SKC, object-level prototypes adaptively aggregate important patch tokens under the guidance of spatial knowledge. Moreover, in TKC, frame-level prototypes utilize temporal attributes to assist in inter-frame temporal relation modeling. These learned prototypes thus provide transparency in capturing fine-grained spatial details and diverse temporal patterns. Experimental results show DiST achieves state-of-the-art results on five standard FSAR datasets.

Motivation: 城市规模的人脸重识别需要在分布式摄像头中处理由视角、遮挡和领域差异引起的严重外观变化，同时遵守防止共享原始图像的数据保护规则。

Method: 提出了一种名为CityGuard的拓扑感知变换器，用于在分布式监控中进行隐私保护的身份检索。该框架集成了三个组件：扩散自适应度量学习器、空间条件注意力机制和差分隐私嵌入映射。

Result: CityGuard能够在视角变化、遮挡和领域迁移下产生鲁棒的描述符，并在隐私和效用之间提供可调的平衡。在Market-1501和其他公共基准测试中，检索精度和查询吞吐量均有显著提升。

Conclusion: CityGuard框架在隐私关键的城市身份匹配方面具有实用性，能够有效地处理数据保护问题，同时提高检索性能。

Abstract: City-scale person re-identification across distributed cameras must handle severe appearance changes from viewpoint, occlusion, and domain shift while complying with data protection rules that prevent sharing raw imagery. We introduce CityGuard, a topology-aware transformer for privacy-preserving identity retrieval in decentralized surveillance. The framework integrates three components. A dispersion-adaptive metric learner adjusts instance-level margins according to feature spread, increasing intra-class compactness. Spatially conditioned attention injects coarse geometry, such as GPS or deployment floor plans, into graph-based self-attention to enable projectively consistent cross-view alignment using only coarse geometric priors without requiring survey-grade calibration. Differentially private embedding maps are coupled with compact approximate indexes to support secure and cost-efficient deployment. Together these designs produce descriptors robust to viewpoint variation, occlusion, and domain shifts, and they enable a tunable balance between privacy and utility under rigorous differential-privacy accounting. Experiments on Market-1501 and additional public benchmarks, complemented by database-scale retrieval studies, show consistent gains in retrieval precision and query throughput over strong baselines, confirming the practicality of the framework for privacy-critical urban identity matching.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two-stage frameworks leveraging discrete motion representations have advanced T2M research, but they often neglect cross-sequence temporal consistency, leading to semantic misalignments and physically implausible motions.

Method: Proposed TCA-T2M, a framework for temporal consistency-aware T2M generation, with TCaS-VQ-VAE for cross-sequence temporal alignment, masked motion transformer for text-conditioned motion generation, and a kinematic constraint block for physical plausibility.

Result: TCA-T2M achieves state-of-the-art performance on HumanML3D and KIT-ML benchmarks, highlighting the importance of temporal consistency in robust and coherent T2M generation.

Conclusion: Temporal consistency is crucial for robust and coherent T2M generation.

Abstract: Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation aims to synthesize realistic human motion sequences from natural language descriptions. While two-stage frameworks leveraging discrete motion representations have advanced T2M research, they often neglect cross-sequence temporal consistency, i.e., the shared temporal structures present across different instances of the same action. This leads to semantic misalignments and physically implausible motions. To address this limitation, we propose TCA-T2M, a framework for temporal consistency-aware T2M generation. Our approach introduces a temporal consistency-aware spatial VQ-VAE (TCaS-VQ-VAE) for cross-sequence temporal alignment, coupled with a masked motion transformer for text-conditioned motion generation. Additionally, a kinematic constraint block mitigates discretization artifacts to ensure physical plausibility. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML benchmarks demonstrate that TCA-T2M achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the importance of temporal consistency in robust and coherent T2M generation.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的密集鸟瞰图（BEV）语义地图训练策略，在预训练阶段无需全监督，在微调阶段减少一半的标注数据，同时提升了BEV分割性能和分割质量。

Abstract: Dense Bird's Eye View (BEV) semantic maps are central to autonomous driving, yet current multi-camera methods depend on costly, inconsistently annotated BEV ground truth. We address this limitation with a two-phase training strategy for fine-grained road marking segmentation that removes full supervision during pretraining and halves the amount of training data during fine-tuning while still outperforming the comparable supervised baseline model. During the self-supervised pretraining, BEVFormer predictions are differentiably reprojected into the image plane and trained against multi-view semantic pseudo-labels generated by the widely used semantic segmentation model Mask2Former. A temporal loss encourages consistency across frames. The subsequent supervised fine-tuning phase requires only 50% of the dataset and significantly less training time. With our method, the fine-tuning benefits from rich priors learned during pretraining boosting the performance and BEV segmentation quality (up to +2.5pp mIoU over the fully supervised baseline) on nuScenes. It simultaneously halves the usage of annotation data and reduces total training time by up to two thirds. The results demonstrate that differentiable reprojection plus camera perspective pseudo labels yields transferable BEV features and a scalable path toward reduced-label autonomous perception.

TL;DR: DohaScript provides a comprehensive dataset for Devanagari handwriting analysis


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  handwritten Devanagari text is underrepresented in public datasets, limiting the utility for data-driven handwriting analysis

Method:  introducing DohaScript, a large scale, multi writer dataset of handwritten Hindi text

Result:  DohaScript enables systematic analysis of writer specific variation, supports tasks like handwriting recognition, and provides a standardized benchmark

Conclusion: DohaScript is intended to advance research on continuous handwritten Devanagari text in low resource script settings

Abstract: Despite having hundreds of millions of speakers, handwritten Devanagari text remains severely underrepresented in publicly available benchmark datasets. Existing resources are limited in scale, focus primarily on isolated characters or short words, and lack controlled lexical content and writer level diversity, which restricts their utility for modern data driven handwriting analysis. As a result, they fail to capture the continuous, fused, and structurally complex nature of Devanagari handwriting, where characters are connected through a shared shirorekha (horizontal headline) and exhibit rich ligature formations. We introduce DohaScript, a large scale, multi writer dataset of handwritten Hindi text collected from 531 unique contributors. The dataset is designed as a parallel stylistic corpus, in which all writers transcribe the same fixed set of six traditional Hindi dohas (couplets). This controlled design enables systematic analysis of writer specific variation independent of linguistic content, and supports tasks such as handwriting recognition, writer identification, style analysis, and generative modeling. The dataset is accompanied by non identifiable demographic metadata, rigorous quality curation based on objective sharpness and resolution criteria, and page level layout difficulty annotations that facilitate stratified benchmarking. Baseline experiments demonstrate clear quality separation and strong generalization to unseen writers, highlighting the dataset's reliability and practical value. DohaScript is intended to serve as a standardized and reproducible benchmark for advancing research on continuous handwritten Devanagari text in low resource script settings.

Method: 提出 PrediT，一个无需训练的加速框架，将特征预测建模为线性多步问题。使用经典线性多步方法预测模型输出，并结合校正器防止误差累积。动态步长调制机制根据特征变化率自适应调整预测范围。

Result: 实验验证，方法在 DiT 基于的图像和视频生成模型中实现高达 5.54 倍的延迟降低，同时质量损失可忽略。

Conclusion: PrediT 在保持生成质量的同时，显著加速了 DiT 的图像和视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as a widely adopted backbone for high-fidelity image and video generation, yet their iterative denoising process incurs high computational costs. Existing training-free acceleration methods rely on feature caching and reuse under the assumption of temporal stability. However, reusing features for multiple steps may lead to latent drift and visual degradation. We observe that model outputs evolve smoothly along much of the diffusion trajectory, enabling principled predictions rather than naive reuse. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{PrediT}, a training-free acceleration framework that formulates feature prediction as a linear multistep problem. We employ classical linear multistep methods to forecast future model outputs from historical information, combined with a corrector that activates in high-dynamics regions to prevent error accumulation. A dynamic step modulation mechanism adaptively adjusts the prediction horizon by monitoring the feature change rate. Together, these components enable substantial acceleration while preserving generation fidelity. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves up to $5.54\times$ latency reduction across various DiT-based image and video generation models, while incurring negligible quality degradation.

Method: 提出OODBench，一个以自动化为主、人工验证为辅的方法，用于构建新的基准并评估VLMs处理异常分布数据的能力。

Result: 在OODBench上，当前VLMs在处理常见类别图像时仍表现出显著的性能下降。此外，还提出了一种可靠的自动化评估指标，用于更全面地评估异常分布数据对难度各异的问题的影响。

Conclusion: 本文提出了OODBench，为评估VLMs处理异常分布数据的能力提供了新的基准和方法，对VLMs在实际应用中的安全性和可靠性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Existing Visual-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved significant progress by being trained on massive-scale datasets, typically under the assumption that data are independent and identically distributed (IID). However, in real-world scenarios, it is often impractical to expect that all data processed by an AI system satisfy this assumption. Furthermore, failure to appropriately handle out-of-distribution (OOD) objects may introduce safety risks in real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving or medical assistance). Unfortunately, current research has not yet provided valid benchmarks that can comprehensively assess the performance of VLMs in response to OOD data. Therefore, we propose OODBench, a predominantly automated method with minimal human verification, for constructing new benchmarks and evaluating the ability of VLMs to process OOD data. OODBench contains 40K instance-level OOD instance-category pairs, and we show that current VLMs still exhibit notable performance degradation on OODBench, even when the underlying image categories are common. In addition, we propose a reliable automated assessment metric that employs a Basic-to-Advanced Progression of prompted questions to assess the impact of OOD data on questions of varying difficulty more fully. Lastly, we summarize substantial findings and insights to facilitate future research in the acquisition and evaluation of OOD data.

Conclusion: 这一研究突出了ViTs在可视化系统和图形感知建模中的应用中的感知差距，并指出了重要的考虑因素。

Abstract: Vision Transformers, ViTs, have emerged as a powerful alternative to convolutional neural networks, CNNs, in a variety of image-based tasks. While CNNs have previously been evaluated for their ability to perform graphical perception tasks, which are essential for interpreting visualizations, the perceptual capabilities of ViTs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the performance of ViTs in elementary visual judgment tasks inspired by the foundational studies of Cleveland and McGill, which quantified the accuracy of human perception across different visual encodings. Inspired by their study, we benchmark ViTs against CNNs and human participants in a series of controlled graphical perception tasks. Our results reveal that, although ViTs demonstrate strong performance in general vision tasks, their alignment with human-like graphical perception in the visualization domain is limited. This study highlights key perceptual gaps and points to important considerations for the application of ViTs in visualization systems and graphical perceptual modeling.

A rule-driven ICoT data-synthesis pipeline jump-starts training by generating structured scene descriptions, reasoning chains and labels, cutting annotation costs. Reinforcement learning then refines the model using a composite reward balancing causal coherence with policy adherence. A multitask architecture models intra-modal manipulations (e.g., exaggerated imagery) and cross-modal mismatches (e.g., subtitle-speech drift), boosting robustness. Experiments on real short-video ads show BLM-Guard surpasses strong baselines in accuracy, consistency and generalization.

Abstract: Generating semantically aligned human motion from textual descriptions has made rapid progress, but ensuring both semantic and physical realism in motion remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce the Distortion-aware Motion Calibrator (DMC), a post-hoc module that refines physically implausible motions (e.g., foot floating) while preserving semantic consistency with the original textual description. Rather than relying on complex physical modeling, we propose a self-supervised and data-driven approach, whereby DMC learns to obtain physically plausible motions when an intentionally distorted motion and the original textual descriptions are given as inputs. We evaluate DMC as a post-hoc module to improve motions obtained from various text-to-motion generation models and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving physical plausibility while enhancing semantic consistency. The experimental results show that DMC reduces FID score by 42.74% on T2M and 13.20% on T2M-GPT, while also achieving the highest R-Precision. When applied to high-quality models like MoMask, DMC improves the physical plausibility of motions by reducing penetration by 33.0% as well as adjusting floating artifacts closer to the ground-truth reference. These results highlight that DMC can serve as a promising post-hoc motion refinement framework for any kind of text-to-motion models by incorporating textual semantics and physical plausibility.

Conclusion: 这项工作突出了标记器鲁棒性在下游任务中的关键作用，并在安全多模态基础模型的发展中迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Discrete image tokenizers encode visual inputs as sequences of tokens from a finite vocabulary and are gaining popularity in multimodal systems, including encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only models. However, unlike CLIP encoders, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks has not been explored. Ours being the first work studying this topic, we first formulate attacks that aim to perturb the features extracted by discrete tokenizers, and thus change the extracted tokens. These attacks are computationally efficient, application-agnostic, and effective across classification, multimodal retrieval, and captioning tasks. Second, to defend against this vulnerability, inspired by recent work on robust CLIP encoders, we fine-tune popular tokenizers with unsupervised adversarial training, keeping all other components frozen. While unsupervised and task-agnostic, our approach significantly improves robustness to both unsupervised and end-to-end supervised attacks and generalizes well to unseen tasks and data. Unlike supervised adversarial training, our approach can leverage unlabeled images, making it more versatile. Overall, our work highlights the critical role of tokenizer robustness in downstream tasks and presents an important step in the development of safe multimodal foundation models.

Conclusion: DEIG是一种有效且可扩展的多实例生成框架，能够生成与丰富、局部化的文本描述精确匹配的视觉上连贯的多实例场景。

Abstract: Multi-Instance Generation has advanced significantly in spatial placement and attribute binding. However, existing approaches still face challenges in fine-grained semantic understanding, particularly when dealing with complex textual descriptions. To overcome these limitations, we propose DEIG, a novel framework for fine-grained and controllable multi-instance generation. DEIG integrates an Instance Detail Extractor (IDE) that transforms text encoder embeddings into compact, instance-aware representations, and a Detail Fusion Module (DFM) that applies instance-based masked attention to prevent attribute leakage across instances. These components enable DEIG to generate visually coherent multi-instance scenes that precisely match rich, localized textual descriptions. To support fine-grained supervision, we construct a high-quality dataset with detailed, compositional instance captions generated by VLMs. We also introduce DEIG-Bench, a new benchmark with region-level annotations and multi-attribute prompts for both humans and objects. Experiments demonstrate that DEIG consistently outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks in spatial consistency, semantic accuracy, and compositional generalization. Moreover, DEIG functions as a plug-and-play module, making it easily integrable into standard diffusion-based pipelines.

Motivation: 设计师需要一种简洁而富有表现力的媒介进行早期时尚创意，草图可以指定结构、轮廓和空间关系，而文字描述可以补充草图，传达材料、颜色和风格细节。

Method: 提出一种名为LOTS的框架，该框架通过结合全局草图指导和多个局部草图-文本对来增强时尚图像生成。LOTS采用多级条件阶段来独立编码共享潜在空间中的局部特征，同时保持全局结构协调。然后，通过扩散模型的多步去噪过程中的注意力指导，将局部和全局条件结合。

Conclusion: LOTS框架在时尚图像生成方面取得了显著的成果，通过结合全局和局部指导，实现了更好的结构一致性和语义丰富性。

Abstract: Sketches offer designers a concise yet expressive medium for early-stage fashion ideation by specifying structure, silhouette, and spatial relationships, while textual descriptions complement sketches to convey material, color, and stylistic details. Effectively combining textual and visual modalities requires adherence to the sketch visual structure when leveraging the guidance of localized attributes from text. We present LOcalized Text and Sketch with multi-level guidance (LOTS), a framework that enhances fashion image generation by combining global sketch guidance with multiple localized sketch-text pairs. LOTS employs a Multi-level Conditioning Stage to independently encode local features within a shared latent space while maintaining global structural coordination. Then, the Diffusion Pair Guidance stage integrates both local and global conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's multi-step denoising process. To validate our method, we develop Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs are provided per image. Sketchy provides high-quality, clean sketches with a professional look and consistent structure. To assess robustness beyond this setting, we also include an "in the wild" split with non-expert sketches, featuring higher variability and imperfections. Experiments demonstrate that our method strengthens global structural adherence while leveraging richer localized semantic guidance, achieving improvement over state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: Diff2DGS：一种用于实时重建遮挡外科场景的可靠3D重建框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高机器人手术、改进外科医生指导和实现自动化，实时重建可变形外科场景至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种名为Diff2DGS的新型两阶段框架，用于可靠地重建遮挡外科场景的3D结构。第一阶段使用基于扩散的视频模块和时间先验进行填充，以高时空一致性修复被工具遮挡的组织。第二阶段，通过可学习的变形模型（LDM）对二维高斯分层（2DGS）进行改进，以捕捉动态组织变形和解剖几何。此外，还通过在SCARED数据集上执行定量深度精度分析，将评估扩展到先前的图像质量指标之外。

Result: Diff2DGS在外观和几何方面均优于现有方法，在EndoNeRF上达到38.02 dB PSNR，在StereoMIS上达到34.40 dB。实验还表明，仅优化图像质量并不一定转化为最佳3D重建精度。为了解决这个问题，进一步优化了重建3D结果的深度质量，确保除了高保真外观外，还有更真实的几何形状。

Conclusion: Diff2DGS是一种可靠的方法，可以用于重建遮挡外科场景的3D结构，在提高机器人手术和外科医生指导方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Real-time reconstruction of deformable surgical scenes is vital for advancing robotic surgery, improving surgeon guidance, and enabling automation. Recent methods achieve dense reconstructions from da Vinci robotic surgery videos, with Gaussian Splatting (GS) offering real-time performance via graphics acceleration. However, reconstruction quality in occluded regions remains limited, and depth accuracy has not been fully assessed, as benchmarks like EndoNeRF and StereoMIS lack 3D ground truth. We propose Diff2DGS, a novel two-stage framework for reliable 3D reconstruction of occluded surgical scenes. In the first stage, a diffusion-based video module with temporal priors inpaints tissue occluded by instruments with high spatial-temporal consistency. In the second stage, we adapt 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with a Learnable Deformation Model (LDM) to capture dynamic tissue deformation and anatomical geometry. We also extend evaluation beyond prior image-quality metrics by performing quantitative depth accuracy analysis on the SCARED dataset. Diff2DGS outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both appearance and geometry, reaching 38.02 dB PSNR on EndoNeRF and 34.40 dB on StereoMIS. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that optimizing for image quality alone does not necessarily translate into optimal 3D reconstruction accuracy. To address this, we further optimize the depth quality of the reconstructed 3D results, ensuring more faithful geometry in addition to high-fidelity appearance.

Conclusion: 我们的方法在具有挑战性的场景中表现出最先进的性能，包括低光、过曝和复杂的亮度及色度变化。

Abstract: High-quality image acquisition in real-world environments remains challenging due to complex illumination variations and inherent limitations of camera imaging pipelines. These issues are exacerbated in multi-view capture, where differences in lighting, sensor responses, and image signal processor (ISP) configurations introduce photometric and chromatic inconsistencies that violate the assumptions of photometric consistency underlying modern 3D novel view synthesis (NVS) methods, including Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), leading to degraded reconstruction and rendering quality. We propose Luminance-GS++, a 3DGS-based framework for robust NVS under diverse illumination conditions. Our method combines a globally view-adaptive lightness adjustment with a local pixel-wise residual refinement for precise color correction. We further design unsupervised objectives that jointly enforce lightness correction and multi-view geometric and photometric consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across challenging scenarios, including low-light, overexposure, and complex luminance and chromatic variations. Unlike prior approaches that modify the underlying representation, our method preserves the explicit 3DGS formulation, improving reconstruction fidelity while maintaining real-time rendering efficiency.

Motivation: 在拓扑数据分析（TDA）领域，构建用于检测拓扑和几何特征的实用滤波器是一项重要任务。

Method: 利用高斯拉普拉斯算子的能力来增强医学图像的边界，定义G-LoG（高斯-高斯拉普拉斯）双滤波器以生成更适合多参数持久模块的特征。将体积图像建模为有界函数，然后我们证明了从我们对有界函数的双滤波器获得的持久性模块上的交错距离与有界函数的最大范数相对于稳定。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于双滤波器的拓扑数据分析方法，该方法在医学图像特征提取和深度学习模型性能提升方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Building practical filtrations on objects to detect topological and geometric features is an important task in the field of Topological Data Analysis (TDA). In this paper, leveraging the ability of the Laplacian of Gaussian operator to enhance the boundaries of medical images, we define the G-LoG (Gaussian-Laplacian of Gaussian) bi-filtration to generate the features more suitable for multi-parameter persistence module. By modeling volumetric images as bounded functions, then we prove the interleaving distance on the persistence modules obtained from our bi-filtrations on the bounded functions is stable with respect to the maximum norm of the bounded functions. Finally, we conduct experiments on the MedMNIST dataset, comparing our bi-filtration against single-parameter filtration and the established deep learning baselines, including Google AutoML Vision, ResNet, AutoKeras and auto-sklearn. Experiments results demonstrate that our bi-filtration significantly outperforms single-parameter filtration. Notably, a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) trained on the topological features generated by our bi-filtration achieves performance comparable to complex deep learning models trained on the original dataset.

Motivation: 为了提高物体检测器在恶劣条件下的性能，提出了一种自我感知的物体检测方法。

Method: 基于退化流形的自我感知框架，通过多层对比学习训练轻量级嵌入头，将具有相同退化成分的图像拉近，不同退化配置的图像推开，从而在无需退化标签或显式密度建模的情况下，捕捉退化类型和严重程度。

Result: 在合成损坏基准、跨数据集零样本迁移和自然天气引起的分布变化上进行了大量实验，结果表明该方法具有强大的原始-退化分离性、跨多个检测器架构的一致行为和语义变化下的鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: 退化感知表示几何提供了实际且与检测器无关的基础。

Abstract: Object detectors achieve strong performance under nominal imaging conditions but can fail silently when exposed to blur, noise, compression, adverse weather, or resolution changes. In safety-critical settings, it is therefore insufficient to produce predictions without assessing whether the input remains within the detector's nominal operating regime. We refer to this capability as self-aware object detection.
  We introduce a degradation-aware self-awareness framework based on degradation manifolds, which explicitly structure a detector's feature space according to image degradation rather than semantic content. Our method augments a standard detection backbone with a lightweight embedding head trained via multi-layer contrastive learning. Images sharing the same degradation composition are pulled together, while differing degradation configurations are pushed apart, yielding a geometrically organized representation that captures degradation type and severity without requiring degradation labels or explicit density modeling.
  To anchor the learned geometry, we estimate a pristine prototype from clean training embeddings, defining a nominal operating point in representation space. Self-awareness emerges as geometric deviation from this reference, providing an intrinsic, image-level signal of degradation-induced shift that is independent of detection confidence.
  Extensive experiments on synthetic corruption benchmarks, cross-dataset zero-shot transfer, and natural weather-induced distribution shifts demonstrate strong pristine-degraded separability, consistent behavior across multiple detector architectures, and robust generalization under semantic shift. These results suggest that degradation-aware representation geometry provides a practical and detector-agnostic foundation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extended reality (XR) requires generative models to respond to users' tracked real-world motion.

Method: Developed a human-centric video world model based on tracked head pose and joint-level hand poses. Evaluated diffusion transformer conditioning strategies and proposed a 3D head and hand control mechanism. Trained a bidirectional video diffusion model teacher and distilled it into an interactive system. 

Result: Generated reality system with improved task performance and higher perceived control compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed system enhances embodied interaction in XR by effectively integrating user motion tracking and generative models.

Abstract: Extended reality (XR) demands generative models that respond to users' tracked real-world motion, yet current video world models accept only coarse control signals such as text or keyboard input, limiting their utility for embodied interaction. We introduce a human-centric video world model that is conditioned on both tracked head pose and joint-level hand poses. For this purpose, we evaluate existing diffusion transformer conditioning strategies and propose an effective mechanism for 3D head and hand control, enabling dexterous hand--object interactions. We train a bidirectional video diffusion model teacher using this strategy and distill it into a causal, interactive system that generates egocentric virtual environments. We evaluate this generated reality system with human subjects and demonstrate improved task performance as well as a significantly higher level of perceived amount of control over the performed actions compared with relevant baselines.

Method: 提出了一种名为MemStream的方法，该方法通过扩展标记预算，实现更精细的空间时间理解和推理。引入自适应选择策略以减少标记冗余，同时保留局部时空信息。此外，提出了一种无需训练的检索专家混合模型，利用外部模型更好地识别相关帧。

Result: MemStream方法在CG-Bench、LVBench和VideoMME（长）上分别比ReKV+Qwen2.5-VL-7B提高了8.0%、8.5%和2.4%的准确率。

Conclusion: MemStream方法在CG-Bench、LVBench和VideoMME（长）上分别比ReKV+Qwen2.5-VL-7B提高了8.0%、8.5%和2.4%的准确率。

Abstract: Streaming video understanding requires models to robustly encode, store, and retrieve information from a continuous video stream to support accurate video question answering (VQA). Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on key-value caching to accumulate frame-level information over time, but use a limited number of tokens per frame, leading to the loss of fine-grained visual details. In this work, we propose scaling the token budget to enable more granular spatiotemporal understanding and reasoning. First, we find that current methods are ill-equipped to handle dense streams: their feature encoding causes query-frame similarity scores to increase over time, biasing retrieval toward later frames. To address this, we introduce an adaptive selection strategy that reduces token redundancy while preserving local spatiotemporal information. We further propose a training-free retrieval mixture-of-experts that leverages external models to better identify relevant frames. Our method, MemStream, achieves +8.0% on CG-Bench, +8.5% on LVBench, and +2.4% on VideoMME (Long) over ReKV with Qwen2.5-VL-7B.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）是否具有人类社交心智的属性。

Result: LLMs之间的神经同步性与它们的社交表现高度相关，揭示了神经同步性与LLMs社交行为之间的联系。

Conclusion: LLMs的社交心智可以通过神经同步性来衡量，并揭示了人类和LLMs社交互动的内部动态之间的惊人相似之处。

Abstract: Neuroscience has uncovered a fundamental mechanism of our social nature: human brain activity becomes synchronized with others in many social contexts involving interaction. Traditionally, social minds have been regarded as an exclusive property of living beings. Although large language models (LLMs) are widely accepted as powerful approximations of human behavior, with multi-LLM system being extensively explored to enhance their capabilities, it remains controversial whether they can be meaningfully compared to human social minds. In this work, we explore neural synchrony between socially interacting LLMs as an empirical evidence for this debate. Specifically, we introduce neural synchrony during social simulations as a novel proxy for analyzing the sociality of LLMs at the representational level. Through carefully designed experiments, we demonstrate that it reliably reflects both social engagement and temporal alignment in their interactions. Our findings indicate that neural synchrony between LLMs is strongly correlated with their social performance, highlighting an important link between neural synchrony and the social behaviors of LLMs. Our work offers a new perspective to examine the "social minds" of LLMs, highlighting surprising parallels in the internal dynamics that underlie human and LLM social interaction.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在预测眼动和阅读时间数据方面的预测能力。

Method: 比较不同大小语言模型在阅读时间数据上的预测性能。

Result: 大模型在预测词义合适的单词方面更有优势，但对与单词识别相关的低级信息敏感性较低。

Conclusion: 大模型的记忆能力有助于预测语义合适的单词，但降低了它们对低级信息的敏感性。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that larger language models have better predictive power for eye movement and reading time data. While even the best models under-allocate probability mass to human responses, larger models assign higher-quality estimates of next tokens and their likelihood of production in cloze data because they are less sensitive to lexical co-occurrence statistics while being better aligned semantically to human cloze responses. The results provide support for the claim that the greater memorization capacity of larger models helps them guess more semantically appropriate words, but makes them less sensitive to low-level information that is relevant for word recognition.

Motivation: 研究为什么引导可靠性在不同行为之间有所不同以及它如何受到引导向量训练数据的影响。

Method: 分析训练激活差异之间的余弦相似性、观察行为数据集中正负激活在引导方向上的分离情况以及比较不同提示变异的引导向量训练效果。

Result: 发现训练激活差异之间的余弦相似性越高，引导越可靠；行为数据集中正负激活在引导方向上分离得越好，引导越可靠；不同提示变异的引导向量训练效果相似且在数据集中表现出相关有效性。

Conclusion: 引导向量在潜在目标行为表示不能有效近似线性引导方向时不可靠，这为诊断引导不可靠性提供了实用方法，并激励了更稳健的引导方法的发展。

Abstract: Steering vectors are a lightweight method for controlling language model behavior by adding a learned bias to the activations at inference time. Although effective on average, steering effect sizes vary across samples and are unreliable for many target behaviors. In my thesis, I investigate why steering reliability differs across behaviors and how it is impacted by steering vector training data. First, I find that higher cosine similarity between training activation differences predicts more reliable steering. Second, I observe that behavior datasets where positive and negative activations are better separated along the steering direction are more reliably steerable. Finally, steering vectors trained on different prompt variations are directionally distinct, yet perform similarly well and exhibit correlated efficacy across datasets. My findings suggest that steering vectors are unreliable when the latent target behavior representation is not effectively approximated by the linear steering direction. Taken together, these insights offer a practical diagnostic for steering unreliability and motivate the development of more robust steering methods that explicitly account for non-linear latent behavior representations.

Motivation: 传统神经主题模型在优化时通常通过重建文档的词袋（BoW）表示，忽略了上下文信息，并且难以处理数据稀疏性。

Method: 提出了一种使用语言模型（LM）构建语义基础软标签目标的新方法，通过将条件于特定提示的下一个标记概率投影到预定义词汇表上，以获得上下文丰富的监督信号。通过训练主题模型使用LM隐藏状态重建软标签，该方法产生了更高质量的、与语料库潜在主题结构更接近的主题。

Conclusion: 该方法在主题建模方面取得了显著成果，为检索应用提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional neural topic models are typically optimized by reconstructing the document's Bag-of-Words (BoW) representations, overlooking contextual information and struggling with data sparsity. In this work, we propose a novel approach to construct semantically-grounded soft label targets using Language Models (LMs) by projecting the next token probabilities, conditioned on a specialized prompt, onto a pre-defined vocabulary to obtain contextually enriched supervision signals. By training the topic models to reconstruct the soft labels using the LM hidden states, our method produces higher-quality topics that are more closely aligned with the underlying thematic structure of the corpus. Experiments on three datasets show that our method achieves substantial improvements in topic coherence, purity over existing baselines. Additionally, we also introduce a retrieval-based metric, which shows that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in identifying semantically similar documents, highlighting its effectiveness for retrieval-oriented applications.

TL;DR: Proposed CondMedQA and CGR improve conditional biomedical QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current biomedical QA systems do not account for the conditional nature of medical knowledge in clinical reasoning.

Method: Propose CondMedQA benchmark and Condition-Gated Reasoning (CGR) framework.

Result: CGR selects condition-appropriate answers more reliably and matches/exceeds state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling conditionality is crucial for robust medical reasoning.

Abstract: Current biomedical question answering (QA) systems often assume that medical knowledge applies uniformly, yet real-world clinical reasoning is inherently conditional: nearly every decision depends on patient-specific factors such as comorbidities and contraindications. Existing benchmarks do not evaluate such conditional reasoning, and retrieval-augmented or graph-based methods lack explicit mechanisms to ensure that retrieved knowledge is applicable to given context. To address this gap, we propose CondMedQA, the first benchmark for conditional biomedical QA, consisting of multi-hop questions whose answers vary with patient conditions. Furthermore, we propose Condition-Gated Reasoning (CGR), a novel framework that constructs condition-aware knowledge graphs and selectively activates or prunes reasoning paths based on query conditions. Our findings show that CGR more reliably selects condition-appropriate answers while matching or exceeding state-of-the-art performance on biomedical QA benchmarks, highlighting the importance of explicitly modeling conditionality for robust medical reasoning.

Result: 指令优化提高了验证准确性，MiPROv2在CoT中提供最稳定的收益，SIMBA在ReAct中提供最大收益

Conclusion: CoT对表格事实核查有效，ReAct需要仔细的指令优化

Abstract: Instruction optimization provides a lightweight, model-agnostic approach to enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). This paper presents the first systematic comparison of instruction optimization, based on the DSPy optimization framework, for tabular fact verification. We evaluate four out-of-the-box prompting techniques that cover both text-only prompting and code use: direct prediction, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), ReAct with SQL tools, and CodeAct with Python execution. We study three optimizers from the DSPy framework -- COPRO, MiPROv2, and SIMBA -- across four benchmarks and three model families. We find that instruction optimization consistently improves verification accuracy, with MiPROv2 yielding the most stable gains for CoT, and SIMBA providing the largest benefits for ReAct agents, particularly at larger model scales. Behavioral analyses reveal that SIMBA encourages more direct reasoning paths by applying heuristics, thereby improving numerical comparison abilities in CoT reasoning and helping avoid unnecessary tool calls in ReAct agents. Across different prompting techniques, CoT remains effective for tabular fact checking, especially with smaller models. Although ReAct agents built with larger models can achieve competitive performance, they require careful instruction optimization.

Motivation: 为了解决临床命名实体识别工具将自由文本映射到统一医学语言系统（UMLS）概念唯一标识符（CUIs）的问题，以及构建包含相关同义词、亚型和上位型的概念集的困难，本研究提出了CUICurate框架。

Method: 构建了UMLS知识图谱（KG）并进行嵌入，用于语义检索。对于每个目标概念，从KG中检索候选CUIs，然后通过大型语言模型（LLM）过滤和分类步骤，比较GPT-5和GPT-5-mini两个LLM。

Result: CUICurate在五个词汇异质临床概念上产生了比人工基准更大的、更完整的概念集，同时匹配人类精度。GPT-5-mini在过滤过程中实现了更高的召回率，而GPT-5产生的分类与临床医生判断更一致。输出在重复运行中稳定，计算成本低。

Conclusion: CUICurate提供了一个可扩展和可重复的方法，以支持UMLS概念集编制，显著减少了人工工作量。通过集成基于图的检索与LLM推理，该框架产生了针对特定候选概念集，可用于适应临床NLP管道的不同表型和分析需求。

Abstract: Background: Clinical named entity recognition tools commonly map free text to Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs). For many downstream tasks, however, the clinically meaningful unit is not a single CUI but a concept set comprising related synonyms, subtypes, and supertypes. Constructing such concept sets is labour-intensive, inconsistently performed, and poorly supported by existing tools, particularly for NLP pipelines that operate directly on UMLS CUIs. Methods We present CUICurate, a Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) framework for automated UMLS concept set curation. A UMLS knowledge graph (KG) was constructed and embedded for semantic retrieval. For each target concept, candidate CUIs were retrieved from the KG, followed by large language model (LLM) filtering and classification steps comparing two LLMs (GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini). The framework was evaluated on five lexically heterogeneous clinical concepts against a manually curated benchmark and gold-standard concept sets. Results Across all concepts, CUICurate produced substantially larger and more complete concept sets than the manual benchmarks whilst matching human precision. Comparisons between the two LLMs found that GPT-5-mini achieved higher recall during filtering, while GPT-5 produced classifications that more closely aligned with clinician judgements. Outputs were stable across repeated runs and computationally inexpensive. Conclusions CUICurate offers a scalable and reproducible approach to support UMLS concept set curation that substantially reduces manual effort. By integrating graph-based retrieval with LLM reasoning, the framework produces focused candidate concept sets that can be adapted to clinical NLP pipelines for different phenotyping and analytic requirements.

Method: 评估文档、页面和块级别的检索，并引入基于预言机的分析来提供检索和生成性能的实证上限。在FinanceBench的150个问题子集上，比较了密集、稀疏、混合和分层方法，包括重新排序和查询重构。引入领域微调的页面评分器，将页面视为文档和块之间的中间检索单元。

Result: 结果表明，在页面召回和块检索方面取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 本文针对金融问答中的检索失败模式进行了研究，提出了新的检索策略和评分器，显著提高了检索性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation is increasingly used for financial question answering over long regulatory filings, yet reliability depends on retrieving the exact context needed to justify answers in high stakes settings. We study a frequent failure mode in which the correct document is retrieved but the page or chunk that contains the answer is missed, leading the generator to extrapolate from incomplete context. Despite its practical significance, this within-document retrieval failure mode has received limited systematic attention in the Financial Question Answering (QA) literature. We evaluate retrieval at multiple levels of granularity, document, page, and chunk level, and introduce an oracle based analysis to provide empirical upper bounds on retrieval and generative performance. On a 150 question subset of FinanceBench, we reproduce and compare diverse retrieval strategies including dense, sparse, hybrid, and hierarchical methods with reranking and query reformulation. Across methods, gains in document discovery tend to translate into stronger page recall, yet oracle performance still suggests headroom for page and chunk level retrieval. To target this gap, we introduce a domain fine-tuned page scorer that treats pages as an intermediate retrieval unit between documents and chunks. Unlike prior passage-based hierarchical retrieval, we fine-tune a bi-encoder specifically for page-level relevance on financial filings, exploiting the semantic coherence of pages. Overall, our results demonstrate a significant improvement in page recall and chunk retrieval.

Method: 进行了一个预先注册的美国调查实验，参与者与ChatGPT进行了关于个人持有的经济政策误解的三轮对话。

Result: 结果显示，表明LLM对受访者所在党派有偏见的简短信息使得说服力降低了28%。转录分析表明，警告改变了互动：受访者更加反驳并较少接受。

Conclusion: 对话式AI的说服力受政治因素影响，受到对党派一致性的感知的限制。

Abstract: Conversational AI has been proposed as a scalable way to correct public misconceptions and spread misinformation. Yet its effectiveness may depend on perceptions of its political neutrality. As LLMs enter partisan conflict, elites increasingly portray them as ideologically aligned. We test whether these credibility attacks reduce LLM-based persuasion. In a preregistered U.S. survey experiment (N=2144), participants completed a three-round conversation with ChatGPT about a personally held economic policy misconception. Compared to a neutral control, a short message indicating that the LLM was biased against the respondent's party attenuated persuasion by 28%. Transcript analysis indicates that the warnings alter the interaction: respondents push back more and engage less receptively. These findings suggest that the persuasive impact of conversational AI is politically contingent, constrained by perceptions of partisan alignment.

TL;DR: 提出对抗性问题生成框架，提高特定领域语言模型适应性


<details>

Motivation: 针对大型语言模型在特定领域适应性差的问题

Method: 提出了一种对抗性问题生成框架

Result: 在LegalBench语料库的特定子集上，该方法实现了更高的准确率，同时使用更少的合成样本

Conclusion: 该方法有效提高了特定领域语言模型的适应性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite extensive pretraining on broad internet corpora, often struggle to adapt effectively to specialized domains. There is growing interest in fine-tuning these models for such domains; however, progress is constrained by the scarcity and limited coverage of high-quality, task-relevant data. To address this, synthetic data generation methods such as paraphrasing or knowledge extraction are commonly applied. Although these approaches excel at factual recall and conceptual knowledge, they suffer from two critical shortcomings: (i) they provide minimal support for interpretive reasoning capabilities in these specialized domains, and (ii) they often produce synthetic corpora that are excessively large and redundant, resulting in poor sample efficiency. To overcome these gaps, we propose an adversarial question-generation framework that produces a compact set of semantically challenging questions. These questions are constructed by comparing the outputs of the model to be adapted and a robust expert model grounded in reference documents, using an iterative, feedback-driven process designed to reveal and address comprehension gaps. Evaluation on specialized subsets of the LegalBench corpus demonstrates that our method achieves greater accuracy with substantially fewer synthetic samples.

TL;DR: 该方法通过频率感知的注意力视角，有效提高了幻觉检测的准确性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保大型语言模型（LLMs）在上下文生成中的可靠性，关键在于幻觉检测。以往的研究探讨了生成过程中可用的内在信号，其中注意力提供了对定位行为的直接视角。然而，现有方法通常依赖于粗糙的摘要，无法捕捉注意力中的细粒度不稳定性。受信号处理的启发，我们通过分析注意力在生成过程中的变化，引入了频率感知的注意力视角。我们将注意力分布建模为离散信号，并提取反映注意力快速局部变化的高频成分。我们的分析表明，幻觉标记与高频注意力能量相关，反映了碎片化和不稳定的定位行为。基于这一见解，我们开发了一个轻量级的幻觉检测器，使用高频注意力特征。在RAGTruth和HalluRAG基准上的实验表明，我们的方法在模型和任务方面优于基于验证、基于内部表示和基于注意力的方法。

Abstract: Hallucination detection is critical for ensuring the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in context-based generation. Prior work has explored intrinsic signals available during generation, among which attention offers a direct view of grounding behavior. However, existing approaches typically rely on coarse summaries that fail to capture fine-grained instabilities in attention. Inspired by signal processing, we introduce a frequency-aware perspective on attention by analyzing its variation during generation. We model attention distributions as discrete signals and extract high-frequency components that reflect rapid local changes in attention. Our analysis reveals that hallucinated tokens are associated with high-frequency attention energy, reflecting fragmented and unstable grounding behavior. Based on this insight, we develop a lightweight hallucination detector using high-frequency attention features. Experiments on the RAGTruth and HalluRAG benchmarks show that our approach achieves performance gains over verification-based, internal-representation-based, and attention-based methods across models and tasks.

Abstract: Large language models generate text through probabilistic sampling from high-dimensional distributions, yet how this process reshapes the structural statistical organization of language remains incompletely characterized. Here we show that lossless compression provides a simple, model-agnostic measure of statistical regularity that differentiates generative regimes directly from surface text. We analyze compression behavior across three progressively more complex information ecosystems: controlled human-LLM continuations, generative mediation of a knowledge infrastructure (Wikipedia vs. Grokipedia), and fully synthetic social interaction environments (Moltbook vs. Reddit). Across settings, compression reveals a persistent structural signature of probabilistic generation. In controlled and mediated contexts, LLM-produced language exhibits higher structural regularity and compressibility than human-written text, consistent with a concentration of output within highly recurrent statistical patterns. However, this signature shows scale dependence: in fragmented interaction environments the separation attenuates, suggesting a fundamental limit to surface-level distinguishability at small scales. This compressibility-based separation emerges consistently across models, tasks, and domains and can be observed directly from surface text without relying on model internals or semantic evaluation. Overall, our findings introduce a simple and robust framework for quantifying how generative systems reshape textual production, offering a structural perspective on the evolving complexity of communication.

Motivation: 为了解决对大型语言模型（LLMs）和视觉语言模型（VLMs）进行越狱的风险，特别是在金融领域，缺乏越狱检测资源的问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为FENCE的双语（韩语-英语）多模态数据集，用于训练和评估金融应用中的越狱检测器。FENCE通过金融相关的查询与基于图像的威胁相结合，强调领域现实性。

Result: 实验表明，商业和开源的VLMs存在一致性的漏洞，GPT-4o显示出可测量的攻击成功率，而开源模型则显示出更大的暴露。基于FENCE训练的基线检测器在分布内部达到99%的准确率，并在外部基准测试中保持强大性能。

Conclusion: FENCE为推进金融领域多模态越狱检测以及支持敏感领域的更安全、更可靠的AI系统提供了一个专注的资源。

Abstract: Jailbreaking poses a significant risk to the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). VLMs are particularly vulnerable because they process both text and images, creating broader attack surfaces. However, available resources for jailbreak detection are scarce, particularly in finance. To address this gap, we present FENCE, a bilingual (Korean-English) multimodal dataset for training and evaluating jailbreak detectors in financial applications. FENCE emphasizes domain realism through finance-relevant queries paired with image-grounded threats. Experiments with commercial and open-source VLMs reveal consistent vulnerabilities, with GPT-4o showing measurable attack success rates and open-source models displaying greater exposure. A baseline detector trained on FENCE achieves 99 percent in-distribution accuracy and maintains strong performance on external benchmarks, underscoring the dataset's robustness for training reliable detection models. FENCE provides a focused resource for advancing multimodal jailbreak detection in finance and for supporting safer, more reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

Abstract: Clickbait headlines degrade the quality of online information and undermine user trust. We present a hybrid approach to clickbait detection that combines transformer-based text embeddings with linguistically motivated informativeness features. Using natural language processing techniques, we evaluate classical vectorizers, word embedding baselines, and large language model embeddings paired with tree-based classifiers. Our best-performing model, XGBoost over embeddings augmented with 15 explicit features, achieves an F1-score of 91\%, outperforming TF-IDF, Word2Vec, GloVe, LLM prompt based classification, and feature-only baselines. The proposed feature set enhances interpretability by highlighting salient linguistic cues such as second-person pronouns, superlatives, numerals, and attention-oriented punctuation, enabling transparent and well-calibrated clickbait predictions. We release code and trained models to support reproducible research.

TL;DR: 提出Info-Gain Sampler，显著提高MDMs解码效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高Masked Diffusion Models（MDMs）的生成质量，提出了一种新的解码框架。

Method: 提出Info-Gain Sampler，平衡即时不确定性与未来掩码token的信息增益。

Result: 在多种架构和任务上，Info-Gain Sampler优于现有采样器，例如推理任务平均准确率提高3.6%，创意写作胜率63.1%。

Conclusion: Info-Gain Sampler在MDMs解码中表现优异，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) offer greater flexibility in decoding order than autoregressive models but require careful planning to achieve high-quality generation. Existing samplers typically adopt greedy heuristics, prioritizing positions with the highest local certainty to decode at each step. Through failure case analysis, we identify a fundamental limitation of this approach: it neglects the downstream impact of current decoding choices on subsequent steps and fails to minimize cumulative uncertainty. In particular, these methods do not fully exploit the non-causal nature of MDMs, which enables evaluating how a decoding decision reshapes token probabilities/uncertainty across all remaining masked positions. To bridge this gap, we propose the Info-Gain Sampler, a principled decoding framework that balances immediate uncertainty with information gain over future masked tokens. Extensive evaluations across diverse architectures and tasks (reasoning, coding, creative writing, and image generation) demonstrate that Info-Gain Sampler consistently outperforms existing samplers for MDMs. For instance, it achieves a 3.6% improvement in average accuracy on reasoning tasks and a 63.1% win-rate in creative writing. Notably, on reasoning tasks it reduces cumulative uncertainty from 78.4 to 48.6, outperforming the best baseline by a large margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工作记忆在实时句子理解中承担重要负荷，需要维持上下文信息来预测后续输入。

Method: 提出了一种基于信息论形式化的处理存储成本度量方法，该方法根据先前单词在不确定性下携带关于未来上下文的信息量来衡量。

Result: 该方法在英语中的三个分析中得到了验证：(i) 恢复了中心嵌入和相对从句中已知的处理不对称性；(ii) 与一个语法基础存储成本在句法标注语料库中相关；(iii) 在两个大规模自然语料数据集中，预测了阅读时间变化，超过了具有传统基于信息预测器的基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为处理存储成本提供了一种新的度量方法，有助于理解句子理解过程中的工作记忆负荷。

Abstract: Real-time sentence comprehension imposes a significant load on working memory, as comprehenders must maintain contextual information to anticipate future input. While measures of such load have played an important role in psycholinguistic theories, they have been formalized, largely, using symbolic grammars, which assign discrete, uniform costs to syntactic predictions. This study proposes a measure of processing storage cost based on an information-theoretic formalization, as the amount of information previous words carry about future context, under uncertainty. Unlike previous discrete, grammar-based metrics, this measure is continuous, theory-neutral, and can be estimated from pre-trained neural language models. The validity of this approach is demonstrated through three analyses in English: our measure (i) recovers well-known processing asymmetries in center embeddings and relative clauses, (ii) correlates with a grammar-based storage cost in a syntactically-annotated corpus, and (iii) predicts reading-time variance in two large-scale naturalistic datasets over and above baseline models with traditional information-based predictors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种置信度驱动的对比解码方法，有效提高了大型语言模型推理的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对大型语言模型推理中的测试时缩放，现有研究通常假设均匀增加推理时间计算可以提高正确性。然而，先前研究表明推理不确定性高度局部化：一小部分低置信度标记物不成比例地导致推理错误和输出扩展。受此观察启发，我们提出了一种基于置信度的对比解码方法，通过目标标记级干预来提高推理可靠性。

Method: 我们提出了一种名为“通过减法思考”的方法，这是一种置信度驱动的对比解码方法，通过目标标记级干预来提高推理可靠性。该方法在解码过程中检测低置信度标记，并在这些位置进行选择性干预。它通过用最小占位符替换高置信度标记来构建对比参考，并通过在低置信度位置减去这个参考分布来细化预测。

Result: 实验表明，CCD在数学推理基准测试中显著提高了准确率，同时大幅减少了输出长度，且KV缓存开销最小。作为一种无需训练的方法，CCD通过目标低置信度干预来提高推理可靠性，而没有计算冗余。

Conclusion: CCD是一种通过置信度驱动的对比解码方法，可以显著提高大型语言模型推理的可靠性，同时减少输出长度和计算开销。

Abstract: Recent work on test-time scaling for large language model (LLM) reasoning typically assumes that allocating more inference-time computation uniformly improves correctness. However, prior studies show that reasoning uncertainty is highly localized: a small subset of low-confidence tokens disproportionately contributes to reasoning errors and unnecessary output expansion. Motivated by this observation, we propose Thinking by Subtraction, a confidence-driven contrastive decoding approach that improves reasoning reliability through targeted token-level intervention. Our method, Confidence-Driven Contrastive Decoding, detects low-confidence tokens during decoding and intervenes selectively at these positions. It constructs a contrastive reference by replacing high-confidence tokens with minimal placeholders, and refines predictions by subtracting this reference distribution at low-confidence locations. Experiments show that CCD significantly improves accuracy across mathematical reasoning benchmarks while substantially reducing output length, with minimal KV-cache overhead. As a training-free method, CCD enhances reasoning reliability through targeted low-confidence intervention without computational redundancy. Our code will be made available at: https://github.com/bolo-web/CCD.

Motivation: 简化大型语言模型内部工作原理的分析，降低使用门槛，使更多人能够使用和理解LLMs。

Method: 设计并构建ELIA，集成了三种关键技术：归因分析、函数向量分析和电路追踪，并引入了一种新的方法：使用视觉-语言模型自动生成自然语言解释。

Result: 用户研究表明，交互式、可探索的界面比简单的静态可视化更受欢迎；AI生成的解释帮助缩小了非专家的知识差距；系统降低了不同经验水平之间的理解障碍。

Conclusion: AI系统可以简化复杂的模型分析，但与注重互动性、具体性和叙事引导的用户中心设计相结合时，其潜力才能得到充分发挥。

Abstract: While mechanistic interpretability has developed powerful tools to analyze the internal workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), their complexity has created an accessibility gap, limiting their use to specialists. We address this challenge by designing, building, and evaluating ELIA (Explainable Language Interpretability Analysis), an interactive web application that simplifies the outcomes of various language model component analyses for a broader audience. The system integrates three key techniques -- Attribution Analysis, Function Vector Analysis, and Circuit Tracing -- and introduces a novel methodology: using a vision-language model to automatically generate natural language explanations (NLEs) for the complex visualizations produced by these methods. The effectiveness of this approach was empirically validated through a mixed-methods user study, which revealed a clear preference for interactive, explorable interfaces over simpler, static visualizations. A key finding was that the AI-powered explanations helped bridge the knowledge gap for non-experts; a statistical analysis showed no significant correlation between a user's prior LLM experience and their comprehension scores, suggesting that the system reduced barriers to comprehension across experience levels. We conclude that an AI system can indeed simplify complex model analyses, but its true power is unlocked when paired with thoughtful, user-centered design that prioritizes interactivity, specificity, and narrative guidance.

Motivation: 由于从社交媒体收集心理健康数据存在困难，我们需要创建一个罗马尼亚语的心理健康语料库。

Method: 创建包含6个开放式问题和标准化PHQ-9和GAD-7筛选问卷的罗马尼亚语语料库，进行统计分析和文本分析，包括使用罗马尼亚LIWC进行情感检测和主题建模。

Result: 创建了PsihoRo语料库，包含205名受访者的文本，为分析和理解罗马尼亚人口的心理健康提供了第一个步骤。

Conclusion: PsihoRo语料库为罗马尼亚心理健康研究提供了重要的资源，并为NLP社区引入了新的研究工具。

Abstract: Psychological corpora in NLP are collections of texts used to analyze human psychology, emotions, and mental health. These texts allow researchers to study psychological constructs, detect mental health issues and analyze emotional language. However, mental health data can be difficult to collect correctly from social media, due to suppositions made by the collectors. A more pragmatic strategy involves gathering data through open-ended questions and then assessing this information with self-report screening surveys. This method was employed successfully for English, a language with a lot of psychological NLP resources. However, this cannot be stated for Romanian, which currently has no open-source mental health corpus. To address this gap, we have created the first corpus for depression and anxiety in Romanian, by utilizing a form with 6 open-ended questions along with the standardized PHQ-9 and GAD-7 screening questionnaires. Consisting of the texts of 205 respondents and although it may seem small, PsihoRo is a first step towards understanding and analyzing texts regarding the mental health of the Romanian population. We employ statistical analysis, text analysis using Romanian LIWC, emotion detection and topic modeling to show what are the most important features of this newly introduced resource to the NLP community.

Abstract: We describe a modern deep learning system that automatically identifies informative contextual examples (\qu{contexts}) for first language vocabulary instruction for high school student. Our paper compares three modeling approaches: (i) an unsupervised similarity-based strategy using MPNet's uniformly contextualized embeddings, (ii) a supervised framework built on instruction-aware, fine-tuned Qwen3 embeddings with a nonlinear regression head and (iii) model (ii) plus handcrafted context features. We introduce a novel metric called the Retention Competency Curve to visualize trade-offs between the discarded proportion of good contexts and the \qu{good-to-bad} contexts ratio providing a compact, unified lens on model performance. Model (iii) delivers the most dramatic gains with performance of a good-to-bad ratio of 440 all while only throwing out 70\% of the good contexts. In summary, we demonstrate that a modern embedding model on neural network architecture, when guided by human supervision, results in a low-cost large supply of near-perfect contexts for teaching vocabulary for a variety of target words.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在印度等司法管辖区，法院面临大量案件积压，人工智能在法律判断预测方面具有变革潜力。

Method: 提出Vichara框架，针对印度司法系统，预测和解释上诉判决。Vichara处理英文上诉案件审理文件，将其分解为决策点。决策点是包含法律问题、决定权力、结果、推理和时序背景的离散法律判断。结构化表示隔离核心判断及其背景，实现准确预测和可解释的解释。Vichara的解释采用IRAC（问题-规则-应用-结论）框架，并针对印度法律推理进行修改。

Result: 在PredEx和ILDC_expert（印度法律文件语料库的专家注释子集）两个数据集上，Vichara超过了现有的判决预测基准，GPT-4o mini在两个数据集上都取得了最高性能（PredEx上的F1为81.5，ILDC_expert上的F1为80.3），其次是Llama-3.1-8B。对生成的解释在清晰度、链接和实用性指标上进行的人类评估突出了GPT-4o mini的优越可解释性。

Conclusion: Vichara框架在印度司法系统中预测和解释上诉判决方面表现出色，提高了法律专业人员的预测评估效率。

Abstract: In jurisdictions like India, where courts face an extensive backlog of cases, artificial intelligence offers transformative potential for legal judgment prediction. A critical subset of this backlog comprises appellate cases, which are formal decisions issued by higher courts reviewing the rulings of lower courts. To this end, we present Vichara, a novel framework tailored to the Indian judicial system that predicts and explains appellate judgments. Vichara processes English-language appellate case proceeding documents and decomposes them into decision points. Decision points are discrete legal determinations that encapsulate the legal issue, deciding authority, outcome, reasoning, and temporal context. The structured representation isolates the core determinations and their context, enabling accurate predictions and interpretable explanations. Vichara's explanations follow a structured format inspired by the IRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) framework and adapted for Indian legal reasoning. This enhances interpretability, allowing legal professionals to assess the soundness of predictions efficiently. We evaluate Vichara on two datasets, PredEx and the expert-annotated subset of the Indian Legal Documents Corpus (ILDC_expert), using four large language models: GPT-4o mini, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B. Vichara surpasses existing judgment prediction benchmarks on both datasets, with GPT-4o mini achieving the highest performance (F1: 81.5 on PredEx, 80.3 on ILDC_expert), followed by Llama-3.1-8B. Human evaluation of the generated explanations across Clarity, Linking, and Usefulness metrics highlights GPT-4o mini's superior interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中知识表示需要捕捉主观、连续的属性，如政治立场，这与成对验证相冲突，成对验证是广泛接受的人类评估的黄金标准。

Method: 通过双重尺度验证框架应用于论证性话语中的政治立场预测，结合点对点和成对的人类标注。使用22个语言模型，构建了一个包含来自英国政治电视节目《问答时间》的30场辩论中23,228个论点的政治立场预测大规模知识库。

Result: 点对点评估显示人机模型有中等程度的一致性（Krippendorff的α=0.578），反映了内在的主观性，而成对验证揭示了人类和模型生成的排名之间的强烈一致性（最佳模型的α=0.86）。

Conclusion: 本研究贡献了：（i）一种平衡可扩展性和可靠性的主观连续知识的实用验证方法；（ii）一个经过验证的结构化论证知识库，它能够支持基于图的理由推理和检索增强生成在政治领域的应用；（iii）从本质上主观的现实世界话语中提取序数结构的证据，从而提高了传统符号或分类方法不足的领域的知识表示能力。

Abstract: Real-world knowledge representation often requires capturing subjective, continuous attributes -- such as political positions -- that conflict with pairwise validation, the widely accepted gold standard for human evaluation. We address this challenge through a dual-scale validation framework applied to political stance prediction in argumentative discourse, combining pointwise and pairwise human annotation. Using 22 language models, we construct a large-scale knowledge base of political position predictions for 23,228 arguments drawn from 30 debates that appeared on the UK politicial television programme \textit{Question Time}. Pointwise evaluation shows moderate human-model agreement (Krippendorff's $α=0.578$), reflecting intrinsic subjectivity, while pairwise validation reveals substantially stronger alignment between human- and model-derived rankings ($α=0.86$ for the best model). This work contributes: (i) a practical validation methodology for subjective continuous knowledge that balances scalability with reliability; (ii) a validated structured argumentation knowledge base enabling graph-based reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation in political domains; and (iii) evidence that ordinal structure can be extracted from pointwise language models predictions from inherently subjective real-world discourse, advancing knowledge representation capabilities for domains where traditional symbolic or categorical approaches are insufficient.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comprehensively retrieving diverse documents is crucial to address queries that admit a wide range of valid answers.

Method: Introduce retrieve-verify-retrieve (RVR), a multi-round retrieval framework designed to maximize answer coverage. Initially, a retriever takes the original query and returns a candidate document set, followed by a verifier that identifies a high-quality subset. For subsequent rounds, the query is augmented with previously verified documents to uncover answers that are not yet covered in previous rounds.

Result: Our method outperforms baselines, including agentic search approaches, achieving at least 10% relative and 3% absolute gain in complete recall percentage on a multi-answer retrieval dataset (QAMPARI). We also see consistent gains on two out-of-domain datasets (QUEST and WebQuestionsSP) across different base retrievers.

Conclusion: Our work presents a promising iterative approach for comprehensive answer recall leveraging a verifier and adapting retrievers to a new inference scenario.

Motivation: 解决现有文化基准在涉及印度文化任务中的局限性，如手动制作、单跳问题测试和成本高昂等问题。

Method: 提出VIRAASAT，一种新的半自动化多跳方法，用于生成针对印度文化的特定多跳问答数据集。VIRAASAT利用包含700多个专家编纂的文化艺术品的知识图，涵盖印度文化的13个关键属性。

Result: 在VIRAASAT上评估了当前最先进的LLMs，并确定了推理中的关键局限性。提出了SCoM框架，通过模拟原子知识图操作来训练模型，提高推理能力。实验表明，SCoM比标准CoT基线表现提高了20%。

Conclusion: VIRAASAT数据集和SCoM框架为构建文化意识推理模型奠定了坚实的基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in reasoning tasks across various domains such as mathematics and coding. However, their performance deteriorates in tasks requiring rich socio-cultural knowledge and diverse local contexts, particularly those involving Indian Culture. Existing Cultural benchmarks are (i) Manually crafted, (ii) contain single-hop questions testing factual recall, and (iii) prohibitively costly to scale, leaving this deficiency largely unmeasured. To address this, we introduce VIRAASAT, a novel, semi-automated multi-hop approach for generating cultural specific multi-hop Question-Answering dataset for Indian culture. VIRAASAT leverages a Knowledge Graph comprising more than 700 expert-curated cultural artifacts, covering 13 key attributes of Indian culture (history, festivals, etc). VIRAASAT spans all 28 states and 8 Union Territories, yielding more than 3,200 multi-hop questions that necessitate chained cultural reasoning. We evaluate current State-of-the-Art (SOTA) LLMs on VIRAASAT and identify key limitations in reasoning wherein fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought(CoT) traces fails to ground and synthesize low-probability facts. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework named Symbolic Chain-of-Manipulation (SCoM). Adapting the Chain-of-Manipulation paradigm, we train the model to simulate atomic Knowledge Graph manipulations internally. SCoM teaches the model to reliably traverse the topological structure of the graph. Experiments on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) demonstrate that SCoM outperforms standard CoT baselines by up to 20%. We release the VIRAASAT dataset along with our findings, laying a strong foundation towards building Culturally Aware Reasoning Models.

### [60] [Reducing Text Bias in Synthetically Generated MCQAs for VLMs in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17677)
*Sutej Kulgod,Sean Ye,Sanchit Tanwar,Christoffer Heckman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种提高VLM在驾驶任务中性能的方法，通过减少文本线索的影响，使模型更依赖于视觉上下文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高视觉语言模型（VLM）在驾驶任务中的性能，需要解决合成MCQA中存在的文本线索问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的方法，通过将正确答案与语言人工制品解耦，并采用课程学习策略，迫使模型依赖于视觉定位。

Result: 该方法将盲准确率从随机选择的+66.9%降低到+2.9%，消除了大多数可利用的文本捷径。

Conclusion: 该方法确保了模型性能准确反映了感知理解，为VLM在驾驶任务中的应用提供了更可靠的基准。

Abstract: Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) benchmarks are an established standard for measuring Vision Language Model (VLM) performance in driving tasks. However, we observe the known phenomenon that synthetically generated MCQAs are highly susceptible to hidden textual cues that allow models to exploit linguistic patterns rather than visual context. Our results show that a VLM fine-tuned on such data can achieve accuracy comparable to human-validated benchmarks even without visual input. Our proposed method reduces blind accuracy from +66.9% above random to +2.9%, eliminating the vast majority of exploitable textual shortcuts. By decoupling the correct answer from linguistic artifacts and employing a curriculum learning strategy, we force the model to rely on visual grounding, ensuring that performance accurately reflects perceptual understanding.

TL;DR: POGPN-JPSS框架在多阶段生物乙醇生产过程中显著提高优化效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian优化在高维多阶段系统中性能有限，因为忽略了中间观察和过程结构。

Method: 提出POGPN-JPSS框架，结合POGPN和JPSS模型，利用中间提取的信息。

Result: 在多阶段生物乙醇生产过程的模拟中，POGPN-JPSS显著优于现有方法，达到性能阈值的时间缩短了一半，可靠性更高。

Conclusion: 结合专家知识和结构化概率模型对于快速过程成熟至关重要。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful method for optimizing black-box manufacturing processes, but its performance is often limited when dealing with high-dimensional multi-stage systems, where we can observe intermediate outputs. Standard BO models the process as a black box and ignores the intermediate observations and the underlying process structure. Partially Observable Gaussian Process Networks (POGPN) model the process as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). However, using intermediate observations is challenging when the observations are high-dimensional state-space time series. Process-expert knowledge can be used to extract low-dimensional latent features from the high-dimensional state-space data. We propose POGPN-JPSS, a framework that combines POGPN with Joint Parameter and State-Space (JPSS) modeling to use intermediate extracted information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of POGPN-JPSS on a challenging, high-dimensional simulation of a multi-stage bioethanol production process. Our results show that POGPN-JPSS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving the desired performance threshold twice as fast and with greater reliability. The fast optimization directly translates to substantial savings in time and resources. This highlights the importance of combining expert knowledge with structured probabilistic models for rapid process maturation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BioBridge是一个结合领域自适应性和通用语言能力的蛋白质理解预训练框架，在多个基准测试上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有蛋白质语言模型（PLM）在多任务适应性和跨生物环境泛化方面存在局限性。通用大型语言模型（LLM）缺乏解释蛋白质序列的能力，在特定领域知识方面不足，限制了其在生物语义推理方面的能力。

Method: 提出BioBridge，一个针对蛋白质理解的领域自适应持续预训练框架。采用领域增量持续预训练（DICP）将蛋白质领域知识和通用推理语料库同时注入LLM，有效缓解灾难性遗忘。通过PLM-投影器-LLM管道实现跨模态对齐，将蛋白质序列嵌入映射到语言模型的语义空间。最终，采用端到端优化以统一支持各种任务，包括蛋白质属性预测和知识问答。

Result: 在多个蛋白质基准测试（如EC和BindingDB）上，BioBridge的性能与主流PLM相当。在MMLU和RACE等通用理解任务上，也取得了与LLM相当的结果。这展示了其将特定领域适应性结合到通用语言能力方面的创新优势。

Conclusion: BioBridge通过结合领域自适应性和通用语言能力，为蛋白质理解和生物语义推理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing Protein Language Models (PLMs) often suffer from limited adaptability to multiple tasks and exhibit poor generalization across diverse biological contexts. In contrast, general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) lack the capability to interpret protein sequences and fall short in domain-specific knowledge, limiting their capacity for effective biosemantic reasoning. To combine the advantages of both, we propose BioBridge, a domain-adaptive continual pretraining framework for protein understanding. This framework employs Domain-Incremental Continual Pre-training (DICP) to infuse protein domain knowledge and general reasoning corpus into a LLM simultaneously, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Cross-modal alignment is achieved via a PLM-Projector-LLM pipeline, which maps protein sequence embeddings into the semantic space of the language model. Ultimately, an end-to-end optimization is adopted to uniformly support various tasks, including protein property prediction and knowledge question-answering. Our proposed BioBridge demonstrates performance comparable to that of mainstream PLMs on multiple protein benchmarks, such as EC and BindingDB. It also achieves results on par with LLMs on general understanding tasks like MMLU and RACE. This showcases its innovative advantage of combining domain-specific adaptability with general-purpose language competency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低大型语言模型的内存和计算成本

Method: 对激活应用可逆变换

Result: 在MX低比特量化中提高平均准确率

Conclusion: LATMiX方法有效提高量化鲁棒性

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a widely used approach for reducing the memory and compute costs of large language models (LLMs). Recent studies have shown that applying invertible transformations to activations can significantly improve quantization robustness by reducing activation outliers; however, existing approaches are largely restricted to rotation or Hadamard-based transformations. Moreover, most studies focused primarily on traditional quantization schemes, whereas modern hardware increasingly supports the microscaling (MX) data format. Attempts to combine both showed severe performance degradation, leading prior work to introduce assumptions on the transformations. In this work, we take a complementary perspective. First, we provide a theoretical analysis of transformations under MX quantization by deriving a bound on the quantization error. Our analysis emphasizes the importance of accounting for both the activation distribution and the underlying quantization structure. Building on this analysis, we propose LATMiX, a method that generalizes outlier reduction to learnable invertible affine transformations optimized using standard deep learning tools. Experiments show consistent improvements in average accuracy for MX low-bit quantization over strong baselines on a wide range of zero-shot benchmarks, across multiple model sizes.

Conclusion: 该方法为在晴空获取约束下进行田间级NDVI预测提供了一种有效的方法。

Abstract: Accurate short-term forecasting of vegetation dynamics is a key enabler for data-driven decision support in precision agriculture. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) forecasting from satellite observations, however, remains challenging due to sparse and irregular sampling caused by cloud coverage, as well as the heterogeneous climatic conditions under which crops evolve. In this work, we propose a probabilistic forecasting framework specifically designed for field-level NDVI prediction under clear-sky acquisition constraints. The method leverages a transformer-based architecture that explicitly separates the modeling of historical vegetation dynamics from future exogenous information, integrating historical NDVI observations with both historical and future meteorological covariates. To address irregular revisit patterns and horizon-dependent uncertainty, we introduce a temporal-distance weighted quantile loss that aligns the training objective with the effective forecasting horizon. In addition, we incorporate cumulative and extreme-weather feature engineering to better capture delayed meteorological effects relevant to vegetation response. Extensive experiments on European satellite data demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms a diverse set of statistical, deep learning, and recent time series baselines across both point-wise and probabilistic evaluation metrics. Ablation studies further highlight the central role of target history, while showing that meteorological covariates provide complementary gains when jointly exploited.

Conclusion: CodeScaler在代码生成和推理方面取得了显著的性能提升，为可扩展的强化学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has driven recent progress in code large language models by leveraging execution-based feedback from unit tests, but its scalability is fundamentally constrained by the availability and reliability of high-quality test cases. We propose CodeScaler, an execution-free reward model designed to scale both reinforcement learning training and test-time inference for code generation. CodeScaler is trained on carefully curated preference data derived from verified code problems and incorporates syntax-aware code extraction and validity-preserving reward shaping to ensure stable and robust optimization. Across five coding benchmarks, CodeScaler improves Qwen3-8B-Base by an average of +11.72 points, outperforming binary execution-based RL by +1.82 points, and enables scalable reinforcement learning on synthetic datasets without any test cases. At inference time, CodeScaler serves as an effective test-time scaling method, achieving performance comparable to unit test approaches while providing a 10-fold reduction in latency. Moreover, CodeScaler surpasses existing reward models on RM-Bench not only in the code domain (+3.3 points), but also in general and reasoning domains (+2.7 points on average).

Method: 统一共椭圆机动框架，结合霍曼转移、安全椭圆邻近操作和显式加油逻辑；使用三种不同的规划算法：贪婪启发式、蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）和深度强化学习（RL）

Result: 实验结果表明，Masked PPO在任务效率和计算性能方面优于贪婪启发式和MCTS，在运行时间上显著优于MCTS；强调了现代RL方法在可扩展、安全和资源高效的空间任务规划方面的潜力

Conclusion: Masked PPO在ADR自主性方面具有巨大潜力，为未来ADR自主性的发展铺平了道路

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of multi target active debris removal (ADR) in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) by introducing a unified coelliptic maneuver framework that combines Hohmann transfers, safety ellipse proximity operations, and explicit refueling logic. We benchmark three distinct planning algorithms Greedy heuristic, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and deep reinforcement learning (RL) using Masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) within a realistic orbital simulation environment featuring randomized debris fields, keep out zones, and delta V constraints. Experimental results over 100 test scenarios demonstrate that Masked PPO achieves superior mission efficiency and computational performance, visiting up to twice as many debris as Greedy and significantly outperforming MCTS in runtime. These findings underscore the promise of modern RL methods for scalable, safe, and resource efficient space mission planning, paving the way for future advancements in ADR autonomy.

Result: AnCoder模型系列证明了结构锚定扩散在高质量代码生成中是参数高效的。

Conclusion: AnchorTree框架通过结构锚定扩散，为高质量的代码生成提供了一种参数高效的途径。

Abstract: Diffusion language models offer a compelling alternative to autoregressive code generation, enabling global planning and iterative refinement of complex program logic. However, existing approaches fail to respect the rigid structure of programming languages and, as a result, often produce broken programs that fail to execute. To address this, we introduce AnchorTree, a framework that explicitly anchors the diffusion process using structured, hierarchical priors native to code. Specifically, AnchorTree uses the abstract syntax tree to prioritize resolving syntactically and semantically salient tokens, such as keywords (e.g., if, while) and identifiers (e.g., variable names), thereby establishing a structural scaffold that guides the remaining generation. We validate this framework via AnCoder, a family of models showing that structurally anchored diffusion offers a parameter-efficient path to high-quality code generation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Medical vision-language models show strong potential for joint reasoning over medical images and clinical text, but their performance often degrades under domain shift caused by variations in imaging devices, acquisition protocols, and reporting styles. Existing multi-modal pre-training methods largely overlook robustness, treating it as a downstream adaptation problem. In this work, we propose Robust Multi-Modal Masked Reconstruction (Robust-MMR), a self-supervised pre-training framework that explicitly incorporates robustness objectives into masked vision-language learning. Robust-MMR integrates asymmetric perturbation-aware masking, domain-consistency regularization, and modality-resilience constraints to encourage domain-invariant representations. We evaluate Robust-MMR on multiple medical vision-language benchmarks, including medical visual question answering (VQA-RAD, SLAKE, VQA-2019), cross-domain image-text classification (MELINDA), and robust image-caption retrieval (ROCO). Robust-MMR achieves 78.9% cross-domain accuracy on VQA-RAD, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.8 percentage points, and reaches 74.6% and 77.0% accuracy on SLAKE and VQA-2019, respectively. Under perturbed evaluation, Robust-MMR improves VQA-RAD accuracy from 69.1% to 75.6%. For image-text classification, cross-domain MELINDA accuracy increases from 70.3% to 75.2%, while retrieval experiments show a reduction in mean rank degradation from over 16 to 4.1 under perturbation. Qualitative results further demonstrate improved clinical reasoning for disease detection and structural abnormality assessment. These findings show that explicitly modeling robustness during pre-training leads to more reliable and transferable medical vision-language representations for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Proposition. Let $f$ be a predictor trained on a distribution $P$ and evaluated on a shifted distribution $Q$. Under verifiable regularity and complexity constraints, the excess risk under shift admits an explicit upper bound determined by a computable shift metric and model parameters. We develop a unified framework in which (i) risk under distribution shift is certified by explicit inequalities, (ii) verification of learned models is sound for nontrivial sizes, and (iii) interpretability is enforced through identifiability conditions rather than post hoc explanations. All claims are stated with explicit assumptions. Failure modes are isolated. Non-certifiable regimes are characterized.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决对抗性分布偏移对真实世界可靠性的威胁，我们引入了一种分布鲁棒的元学习框架。

Method: 通过在Wasserstein分布偏移下提供最坏情况性能保证，对线性自注意力Transformer进行非渐近性分析，以研究对抗性扰动强度、模型容量和上下文示例数量之间的关系。

Result: 分析表明，模型鲁棒性与模型容量的平方根成正比，而对抗性设置对样本复杂度施加了与扰动幅度平方成正比的惩罚。实验结果证实了这些比例规律。

Conclusion: 这些发现推进了对对抗条件下ICL限制的理论理解，并表明模型容量是分布鲁棒性的基本资源。

Abstract: Large language models adapt to new tasks through in-context learning (ICL) without parameter updates. Current theoretical explanations for this capability assume test tasks are drawn from a distribution similar to that seen during pretraining. This assumption overlooks adversarial distribution shifts that threaten real-world reliability. To address this gap, we introduce a distributionally robust meta-learning framework that provides worst-case performance guarantees for ICL under Wasserstein-based distribution shifts. Focusing on linear self-attention Transformers, we derive a non-asymptotic bound linking adversarial perturbation strength ($ρ$), model capacity ($m$), and the number of in-context examples ($N$). The analysis reveals that model robustness scales with the square root of its capacity ($ρ_{\text{max}} \propto \sqrt{m}$), while adversarial settings impose a sample complexity penalty proportional to the square of the perturbation magnitude ($N_ρ- N_0 \propto ρ^2$). Experiments on synthetic tasks confirm these scaling laws. These findings advance the theoretical understanding of ICL's limits under adversarial conditions and suggest that model capacity serves as a fundamental resource for distributional robustness.

Motivation: 针对现有学习方法存在的参数和持久记忆中信息回流的漏洞，提出了一种同步回溯学习方法。

Method: 同步回溯学习方法（SBU），通过参数和记忆路径的联合回溯，参数路径采用随机参考对齐，记忆路径基于依赖闭包进行回溯。

Result: SBU在减少目标私有信息痕迹的同时，对保留数据的影响有限。

Conclusion: SBU是一种有效的联合回溯学习方法，可以减少信息回流的漏洞，并保持数据的完整性。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce \textbf{agentic unlearning} which removes specified information from both model parameters and persistent memory in agents with closed-loop interaction. Existing unlearning methods target parameters alone, leaving two critical gaps: (i) parameter-memory backflow, where retrieval reactivates parametric remnants or memory artifacts reintroduce sensitive content, and (ii) the absence of a unified strategy that covers both parameter and memory pathways. We present Synchronized Backflow Unlearning (SBU), a framework that unlearns jointly across parameter and memory pathways. The memory pathway performs dependency closure-based unlearning that prunes isolated entities while logically invalidating shared artifacts. The parameter pathway employs stochastic reference alignment to guide model outputs toward a high-entropy prior. These pathways are integrated via a synchronized dual-update protocol, forming a closed-loop mechanism where memory unlearning and parametric suppression reinforce each other to prevent cross-pathway recontamination. Experiments on medical QA benchmarks show that SBU reduces traces of targeted private information across both pathways with limited degradation on retained data.

Method: 评估了四种不同的量化算法：AWQ、GPTQ、SmoothQuant和FlatQuant，并在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen系列模型（1.5B/7B/14B）和QwQ-32B上应用。

Result: 发现平台敏感性很高，4位权重量化对于大型模型是可行的，但激进的4位权重-激活量化方案在NPU上存在层级校准不稳定，导致长上下文推理任务中的逻辑崩溃。8位量化在数值上保持稳定。INT8部署表明，尽管优化内核减少了延迟，但动态量化开销目前限制了端到端加速。

Conclusion: 为在Ascend NPU上部署量化推理模型提供了实际参考。

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is crucial for efficient model deployment, yet its effectiveness on Ascend NPU remains under-explored compared to GPU architectures. This paper presents a case study of representative PTQ baselines applied to reasoning-oriented models such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen series (1.5B/7B/14B) and QwQ-32B. We evaluate four distinct algorithms, including AWQ, GPTQ, SmoothQuant, and FlatQuant, to cover the spectrum from weight-only compression to advanced rotation-based methods. Our empirical results reveal significant platform sensitivity. While 4-bit weight-only quantization proves viable for larger models, aggressive 4-bit weight-activation schemes suffer from layer-wise calibration instability on the NPU, leading to logic collapse in long-context reasoning tasks. Conversely, standard 8-bit quantization remains numerically stable. Furthermore, a real-world INT8 deployment demonstrates that although optimized kernels reduce latency, dynamic quantization overheads currently limit end-to-end acceleration. These findings offer a practical reference for the feasibility and limitations of deploying quantized reasoning models on Ascend NPU.

Method: 提出自适应互补探索（ACE）算法

Result: 提高对目标分布的逼近精度和发现多样化高奖励状态的发现率

Conclusion: ACE算法在GFlowNets学习中有效探索新和高概率区域

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are a flexible family of amortized samplers trained to generate discrete and compositional objects with probability proportional to a reward function. However, learning efficiency is constrained by the model's ability to rapidly explore diverse high-probability regions during training. To mitigate this issue, recent works have focused on incentivizing the exploration of unvisited and valuable states via curiosity-driven search and self-supervised random network distillation, which tend to waste samples on already well-approximated regions of the state space. In this context, we propose Adaptive Complementary Exploration (ACE), a principled algorithm for the effective exploration of novel and high-probability regions when learning GFlowNets. To achieve this, ACE introduces an exploration GFlowNet explicitly trained to search for high-reward states in regions underexplored by the canonical GFlowNet, which learns to sample from the target distribution. Through extensive experiments, we show that ACE significantly improves upon prior work in terms of approximation accuracy to the target distribution and discovery rate of diverse high-reward states.

TL;DR: EXACT：一种基于可解释属性的用户特定个性化生成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化对齐需要根据每个用户的不断变化的环境调整大型语言模型。虽然解码时间个性化提供了一种可扩展的替代方案，但现有方法在很大程度上依赖于隐式、难以解释的偏好表示，并施加了一个刚性、与上下文无关的用户表示，未能考虑到偏好如何随着提示而变化。

Method: 我们引入了EXACT，这是一种新的解码时间个性化，它使用预定义的可解释属性集与有限的成对偏好反馈对齐生成。EXACT首先在离线阶段通过最大化首选响应的可能性来识别用户特定的属性子集。然后，在在线推理期间，EXACT检索与传入提示最相关的属性并将它们注入上下文中以引导生成。

Result: 我们为所提出的算法在温和的假设下建立了理论近似保证，并证明了我们的基于相似性的检索机制有效地减轻了上下文偏好偏移，适应了不同的任务，而无需汇总冲突的偏好。在人工标注的偏好数据集上的大量实验表明，EXACT在包括偏好建模准确性和个性化生成质量在内的基准上始终优于基线。

Conclusion: EXACT是一种有效的解码时间个性化方法，能够通过利用可解释属性来提高个性化生成质量。

Abstract: Achieving personalized alignment requires adapting large language models to each user's evolving context. While decoding-time personalization offers a scalable alternative to training-time methods, existing methods largely rely on implicit, less interpretable preference representations and impose a rigid, context-agnostic user representation, failing to account for how preferences shift across prompts. We introduce EXACT, a new decoding-time personalization that aligns generation with limited pairwise preference feedback using a predefined set of interpretable attributes. EXACT first identifies user-specific attribute subsets by maximizing the likelihood of preferred responses in the offline stage. Then, for online inference, EXACT retrieves the most semantically relevant attributes for an incoming prompt and injects them into the context to steer generation. We establish theoretical approximation guarantees for the proposed algorithm under mild assumptions, and provably show that our similarity-based retrieval mechanism effectively mitigates contextual preference shifts, adapting to disparate tasks without pooling conflicting preferences. Extensive experiments on human-annotated preference datasets demonstrate that EXACT consistently outperforms strong baselines, including preference modeling accuracy and personalized generation quality.

Method: 系统评估了四种跨越不同参数粒度的安全区域识别方法，从单个权重到整个Transformer层，在四个不同大小的LLM骨干模型家族中。

Result: 发现识别出的安全区域重叠程度低到中等，使用IoU测量。当使用效用数据集（即无害查询）进一步细化安全区域时，重叠程度显著下降。

Conclusion: 当前技术无法可靠地识别稳定、与数据集无关的安全区域。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often assumed to contain ``safety regions'' -- parameter subsets whose modification directly influences safety behaviors. We conduct a systematic evaluation of four safety region identification methods spanning different parameter granularities, from individual weights to entire Transformer layers, across four families of backbone LLMs with varying sizes. Using ten safety identification datasets, we find that the identified safety regions exhibit only low to moderate overlap, as measured by IoU. The overlap drops significantly when the safety regions are further refined using utility datasets (\ie non-harmful queries). These results suggest that current techniques fail to reliably identify a stable, dataset-agnostic safety region.

Abstract: Multi-turn interaction length is a dominant factor in the operational costs of conversational LLMs. In this work, we present a new failure mode in conversational LLMs: turn amplification, in which a model consistently prolongs multi-turn interactions without completing the underlying task. We show that an adversary can systematically exploit clarification-seeking behavior$-$commonly encouraged in multi-turn conversation settings$-$to scalably prolong interactions. Moving beyond prompt-level behaviors, we take a mechanistic perspective and identify a query-independent, universal activation subspace associated with clarification-seeking responses. Unlike prior cost-amplification attacks that rely on per-turn prompt optimization, our attack arises from conversational dynamics and persists across prompts and tasks. We show that this mechanism provides a scalable pathway to induce turn amplification: both supply-chain attacks via fine-tuning and runtime attacks through low-level parameter corruptions consistently shift models toward abstract, clarification-seeking behavior across prompts. Across multiple instruction-tuned LLMs and benchmarks, our attack substantially increases turn count while remaining compliant. We also show that existing defenses offer limited protection against this emerging class of failures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used across a wide range of tasks. However, their substantial computational demands raise concerns about the energy efficiency and sustainability of both training and inference. Inference, in particular, dominates total compute usage, making its optimization crucial. Recent research has explored optimization techniques and analyzed how configuration choices influence energy consumption. Yet, the vast configuration space of inference servers makes exhaustive empirical evaluation infeasible due to combinatorial explosion. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on this problem by treating LLMs as configurable systems and applying variability management techniques to systematically analyze inference-time configuration choices. We evaluate our approach on the Hugging Face Transformers library by representing generation hyperparameters and their constraints using a feature-based variability model, sampling representative configurations, measuring their energy consumption, latency, accuracy, and learning predictive models from the collected data. Our results show that variability modeling effectively manages the complexity of LLM inference configurations. It enables systematic analysis of hyperparameters effects and interactions, reveals trade-offs, and supports accurate prediction of inference behavior from a limited number of measurements. Overall, this work opens a new research direction that bridges software engineering and machine learning by leveraging variability modeling for the efficient and sustainable configuration of LLMs.

Abstract: Post-training weight quantization is crucial for reducing the memory and inference cost of large language models (LLMs), yet pushing the average precision below 4 bits remains challenging due to highly non-uniform weight sensitivity and the lack of principled precision allocation. Existing solutions use irregular fine-grained mixed-precision with high runtime overhead or rely on heuristics or highly constrained precision allocation strategies. In this work, we propose ScaleBITS, a mixed-precision quantization framework that enables automated, fine-grained bitwidth allocation under a memory budget while preserving hardware efficiency. Guided by a new sensitivity analysis, we introduce a hardware-aligned, block-wise weight partitioning scheme, powered by bi-directional channel reordering. We formulate global bitwidth allocation as a constrained optimization problem and develop a scalable approximation to the greedy algorithm, enabling end-to-end principled allocation. Experiments show that ScaleBITS significantly improves over uniform-precision quantization (up to +36%) and outperforms state-of-the-art sensitivity-aware baselines (up to +13%) in ultra-low-bit regime, without adding runtime overhead.

Motivation: 为了解决可微分神经架构搜索（NAS）在实践中的局限性，提出了MIDAS方法。

Method: 通过用自注意力计算动态、输入特定的参数来改进DARTS，局部化架构选择，并引入无参数、拓扑感知的搜索空间。

Result: 在DARTS、NAS-Bench-201和RDARTS搜索空间中评估MIDAS，在DARTS上达到97.42%的CIFAR-10 top-1和83.38%的CIFAR-100，在NAS-Bench-201中找到全局最优架构，在RDARTS上在CIFAR-10的四个搜索空间中的两个上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: MIDAS通过改进DARTS，提高了NAS的效率和鲁棒性，在多个数据集上取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS) provides efficient, gradient-based methods for automatically designing neural networks, yet its adoption remains limited in practice. We present MIDAS, a novel approach that modernizes DARTS by replacing static architecture parameters with dynamic, input-specific parameters computed via self-attention. To improve robustness, MIDAS (i) localizes the architecture selection by computing it separately for each spatial patch of the activation map, and (ii) introduces a parameter-free, topology-aware search space that models node connectivity and simplifies selecting the two incoming edges per node. We evaluate MIDAS on the DARTS, NAS-Bench-201, and RDARTS search spaces. In DARTS, it reaches 97.42% top-1 on CIFAR-10 and 83.38% on CIFAR-100. In NAS-Bench-201, it consistently finds globally optimal architectures. In RDARTS, it sets the state of the art on two of four search spaces on CIFAR-10. We further analyze why MIDAS works, showing that patchwise attention improves discrimination among candidate operations, and the resulting input-specific parameter distributions are class-aware and predominantly unimodal, providing reliable guidance for decoding.

Conclusion: PaCoDi是时间序列建模的突破性进展，解决了传统模型的局限性。

Abstract: Modeling long-range dependencies in time series generation poses a fundamental trade-off between representational capacity and computational efficiency. Traditional temporal diffusion models suffer from local entanglement and the $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ cost of attention mechanisms. We address these limitations by introducing PaCoDi (Parallel Complex Diffusion), a spectral-native architecture that decouples generative modeling in the frequency domain. PaCoDi fundamentally alters the problem topology: the Fourier Transform acts as a diagonalizing operator, converting locally coupled temporal signals into globally decorrelated spectral components. Theoretically, we prove the Quadrature Forward Diffusion and Conditional Reverse Factorization theorem, demonstrating that the complex diffusion process can be split into independent real and imaginary branches. We bridge the gap between this decoupled theory and data reality using a \textbf{Mean Field Theory (MFT) approximation} reinforced by an interactive correction mechanism. Furthermore, we generalize this discrete DDPM to continuous-time Frequency SDEs, rigorously deriving the Spectral Wiener Process describe the differential spectral Brownian motion limit. Crucially, PaCoDi exploits the Hermitian Symmetry of real-valued signals to compress the sequence length by half, achieving a 50% reduction in attention FLOPs without information loss. We further derive a rigorous Heteroscedastic Loss to handle the non-isotropic noise distribution on the compressed manifold. Extensive experiments show that PaCoDi outperforms existing baselines in both generation quality and inference speed, offering a theoretically grounded and computationally efficient solution for time series modeling.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting is a critical task across many domains, from engineering to economics, where accurate predictions drive strategic decisions. However, applying advanced deep learning models in challenging, volatile domains like finance is difficult due to the inherent limitation and dynamic nature of financial time series data. This scarcity often results in sub-optimal model training and poor generalization. The fundamental challenge lies in determining how to reliably augment scarce financial time series data to enhance the predictive accuracy of deep learning forecasting models. Our main contribution is a demonstration of how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can effectively serve as a data augmentation tool to overcome data scarcity in the financial domain. Specifically, we show that training a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) forecasting model on a dataset augmented with synthetic data generated by a transformer-based GAN (TTS-GAN) significantly improves the forecasting accuracy compared to using real data alone. We confirm these results across different financial time series (Bitcoin and S\&P500 price data) and various forecasting horizons. Furthermore, we propose a novel, time series specific quality metric that combines Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and a modified Deep Dataset Dissimilarity Measure (DeD-iMs) to reliably monitor the training progress and evaluate the quality of the generated data. These findings provide compelling evidence for the benefits of GAN-based data augmentation in enhancing financial predictive capabilities.

TL;DR: Grassmannian MoE（GrMoE）是一种新的路由框架，通过控制稀疏性提高了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决标准softmax门控无法控制稀疏性和利用率之间的权衡问题，提出了Grassmannian MoE（GrMoE）路由框架。

Method: 在Grassmannian子空间流形上操作，门控权重来自矩阵Bingham分布的集中参数。

Result: GrMoE在合成路由任务中取得了优异的性能，包括0%的路由崩溃，与15-30%改进的负载平衡，以及浓度和有效稀疏性之间的平滑单调关系，使得后处理稀疏性调整成为可能。

Conclusion: GrMoE为集中控制的稀疏性提供了第一个形式化理论，并通过专家学习获得了与语言专业化的相关性，从而实现了可解释的路由行为。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts models rely on learned routers to assign tokens to experts, yet standard softmax gating provides no principled mechanism to control the tradeoff between sparsity and utilization. We propose Grassmannian MoE (GrMoE), a routing framework that operates on the Grassmannian manifold of subspaces, where gating weights arise from the concentration parameters of Matrix Bingham distributions. This construction yields a single, interpretable knob -- the concentration matrix $Λ$ -- that continuously controls routing entropy, replacing discrete top-$k$ selection with a smooth, geometrically principled sparsity mechanism. We further develop an amortized variational inference procedure for posterior routing distributions, enabling uncertainty-aware expert assignment that naturally resists expert collapse. We formally prove tight bounds relating the Bingham concentration spectrum to routing entropy, expected top-$k$ mass, and an exponential bound on expert collapse, establishing the first formal theory of concentration-controlled sparsity. On synthetic routing tasks, a 350M-parameter MoE language model with 8 experts, a 1.3B-parameter model with 16 experts, and a 2.7B-parameter model with 32 experts, GrMoE achieves 0\% routing collapse across all seeds, comparable or better perplexity with 15--30\% improved load balance, and a smooth monotonic relationship between concentration and effective sparsity that enables post-hoc sparsity tuning without retraining. Token-level analysis reveals that experts learn heterogeneous concentration values that correlate with linguistic specialization, providing interpretable routing behavior.

Result: MantisV2 and Mantis+ achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance in various benchmarks and datasets.

Conclusion: MantisV2 and Mantis+ significantly enhance zero-shot feature extraction for time series classification.

Abstract: Developing foundation models for time series classification is of high practical relevance, as such models can serve as universal feature extractors for diverse downstream tasks. Although early models such as Mantis have shown the promise of this approach, a substantial performance gap remained between frozen and fine-tuned encoders. In this work, we introduce methods that significantly strengthen zero-shot feature extraction for time series. First, we introduce Mantis+, a variant of Mantis pre-trained entirely on synthetic time series. Second, through controlled ablation studies, we refine the architecture and obtain MantisV2, an improved and more lightweight encoder. Third, we propose an enhanced test-time methodology that leverages intermediate-layer representations and refines output-token aggregation. In addition, we show that performance can be further improved via self-ensembling and cross-model embedding fusion. Extensive experiments on UCR, UEA, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) benchmarks, and EEG datasets show that MantisV2 and Mantis+ consistently outperform prior time series foundation models, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA enable practical adaptation of large language models but provide no principled uncertainty estimates, leading to poorly calibrated predictions and unreliable behavior under domain shift. We introduce Stiefel-Bayes Adapters (SBA), a Bayesian PEFT framework that places a Matrix Langevin prior over orthonormal adapter factors on the Stiefel manifold $\St$ and performs approximate posterior inference via tangent space Laplace approximation with geodesic retraction. Unlike Gaussian priors in flat space projected onto orthogonality constraints, our prior on the manifold naturally encodes the inductive bias that adapter subspaces should be well conditioned and orthogonal, while the posterior provides calibrated predictive uncertainty without recalibration. We prove formally that the tangent space approximation strictly avoids the structural variance inflation inherent in projecting from ambient space, establishing a rigorous theoretical advantage for intrinsic manifold inference. Across GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks on RoBERTa-large, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-2-13B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B, domain shift evaluations, selective prediction protocols, and an abstractive summarization task, SBA achieves task performance comparable to LoRA and DoRA while reducing Expected Calibration Error by 18 to 34\% over deterministic baselines, improving selective prediction AUROC by 12 to 25\% under domain shift, and outperforming deep ensembles of five LoRA models on OOD detection at a fraction of the parameter cost. Our results demonstrate that where you place uncertainty, on the right geometric structure, matters more than simply adding any Bayesian treatment to adapters.

TL;DR: ruleXplain框架利用LLMs从模拟驱动的动力系统中提取因果规则，为时间序列数据分析提供了一种新的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推断具有延迟效应的时间序列数据中的因果关系是一个基本挑战，特别是当底层系统表现出复杂的动态，而这些动态无法通过简单的函数映射来捕捉时。传统方法往往无法产生普遍和可解释的解释，因为多个不同的输入轨迹可能产生几乎无法区分的输出。

Method: ruleXplain框架利用大型语言模型（LLMs）从模拟驱动的动力系统中的输入输出关系中提取形式解释。该方法引入了一种约束符号规则语言，具有时间操作符和延迟语义，使LLMs能够通过结构化提示生成可验证的因果规则。ruleXplain依赖于一个原则性的模型（例如，模拟器），该模型将多元输入时间序列映射到输出时间序列。在ruleXplain中，模拟器用于生成产生类似目标输出的各种反事实输入轨迹，作为候选解释。这些反事实输入被聚类并作为上下文提供给LLM，LLM的任务是生成编码输出时间序列中可观察模式的责任性联合时间趋势的符号规则。闭环精炼过程确保规则一致性和语义有效性。

Result: 使用PySIRTEM流行病模拟器将测试率输入映射到每日感染计数；以及EnergyPlus建筑能源模拟器，观察温度和太阳辐射输入到电力需求。通过三种类型的实验进行验证：(1)通过输入重建评估规则集的有效性；(2)消除研究评估规则集的因果编码；(3)跨未见输出趋势的提取规则泛化测试，这些趋势具有不同的相动力学。

Conclusion: ruleXplain框架能够有效地从模拟驱动的动力系统中提取因果规则，为时间序列数据分析提供了一种新的方法。

Abstract: Inferring causal relations in timeseries data with delayed effects is a fundamental challenge, especially when the underlying system exhibits complex dynamics that cannot be captured by simple functional mappings. Traditional approaches often fail to produce generalized and interpretable explanations, as multiple distinct input trajectories may yield nearly indistinguishable outputs. In this work, we present ruleXplain, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract formal explanations for input-output relations in simulation-driven dynamical systems. Our method introduces a constrained symbolic rule language with temporal operators and delay semantics, enabling LLMs to generate verifiable causal rules through structured prompting. ruleXplain relies on the availability of a principled model (e.g., a simulator) that maps multivariate input time series to output time series. Within ruleXplain, the simulator is used to generate diverse counterfactual input trajectories that yield similar target output, serving as candidate explanations. Such counterfactual inputs are clustered and provided as context to the LLM, which is tasked with the generation of symbolic rules encoding the joint temporal trends responsible for the patterns observable in the output times series. A closed-loop refinement process ensures rule consistency and semantic validity. We validate the framework using the PySIRTEM epidemic simulator, mapping testing rate inputs to daily infection counts; and the EnergyPlus building energy simulator, observing temperature and solar irradiance inputs to electricity needs. For validation, we perform three classes of experiments: (1) the efficacy of the ruleset through input reconstruction; (2) ablation studies evaluating the causal encoding of the ruleset; and (3) generalization tests of the extracted rules across unseen output trends with varying phase dynamics.

Conclusion: 机器学习模型在预测CRS手术受益方面具有潜力，可以增强临床决策并支持个性化的CRS护理

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly transformed medical prognostics by enabling rapid and accurate analysis across imaging and pathology. However, the investigation of machine learning predictions applied to prospectively collected, standardized data from observational clinical intervention trials remains underexplored, despite its potential to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), a persistent inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses lasting more than three months, imposes a substantial burden on quality of life (QoL) and societal cost. Although many patients respond to medical therapy, others with refractory symptoms often pursue surgical intervention. Surgical decision-making in CRS is complex, as it must weigh known procedural risks against uncertain individualized outcomes. In this study, we evaluated supervised machine learning models for predicting surgical benefit in CRS, using the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) as the primary patient-reported outcome. Our prospectively collected cohort from an observational intervention trial comprised patients who all underwent surgery; we investigated whether models trained only on preoperative data could identify patients who might not have been recommended surgery prior to the procedure. Across multiple algorithms, including an ensemble approach, our best model achieved approximately 85% classification accuracy, providing accurate and interpretable predictions of surgical candidacy. Moreover, on a held-out set of 30 cases spanning mixed difficulty, our model achieved 80% accuracy, exceeding the average prediction accuracy of expert clinicians (75.6%), demonstrating its potential to augment clinical decision-making and support personalized CRS care.

Abstract: Stochastic Optimal Control provides a unified mathematical framework for solving complex decision-making problems, encompassing paradigms such as maximum entropy reinforcement learning(RL) and imitation learning(IL). However, conventional parametric policies often struggle to represent the multi-modality of the solutions. Though diffusion-based policies are aimed at recovering the multi-modality, they lack an explicit probability density, which complicates policy-gradient optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose MePoly, a novel policy parameterization based on polynomial energy-based models. MePoly provides an explicit, tractable probability density, enabling exact entropy maximization. Theoretically, we ground our method in the classical moment problem, leveraging the universal approximation capabilities for arbitrary distributions. Empirically, we demonstrate that MePoly effectively captures complex non-convex manifolds and outperforms baselines in performance across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Diffusion models generate high-quality samples but can also memorize training data, raising serious privacy concerns. Understanding the mechanisms governing when memorization versus generalization occurs remains an active area of research. In particular, it is unclear where along the noise schedule memorization is induced, how data geometry influences it, and how phenomena at different noise scales interact. We introduce a geometric framework that partitions the noise schedule into three regimes based on the coverage properties of training data by Gaussian shells and the concentration behavior of the posterior, which we argue are two fundamental objects governing memorization and generalization in diffusion models. This perspective reveals that memorization risk is highly non-uniform across noise levels. We further identify a danger zone at medium noise levels where memorization is most pronounced. In contrast, both the small and large noise regimes resist memorization, but through fundamentally different mechanisms: small noise avoids memorization due to limited training coverage, while large noise exhibits low posterior concentration and admits a provably near linear Gaussian denoising behavior. For the medium noise regime, we identify geometric conditions through which we propose a geometry-informed targeted intervention that mitigates memorization.

Abstract: Training and serving Large Language Models (LLMs) relies heavily on parallelization and collective operations, which are frequently bottlenecked by network bandwidth. Lossless compression using e.g., Huffman codes can alleviate the issue, however, Huffman codes suffer from slow, bit-sequential decoding and high hardware complexity due to deep tree traversals. Universal codes e.g., Exponential-Golomb codes are faster to decode but do not exploit the symbol frequency distributions. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Dual Length Codes, a hybrid approach designed to balance compression efficiency with decoding speed. Analyzing BFloat16 tensors from the Gemma model, we observed that the top 8 most frequent symbols account for approximately 50% of the cumulative probability. These 8 symbols are assigned a short 4 bit code. The remaining 248 symbols are assigned a longer 9 bit code. The coding scheme uses a single prefix bit to distinguish between the two code lengths. The scheme uses a small Look Up Table with only 8 entries for encoding and decoding. The scheme achieves a compressibility of 18.6% in comparison to 21.3% achieved by Huffman codes, but it significantly speeds up the decoding and simplifies the hardware complexity.

Result: 在Gemma 2 2B的稀疏自编码器潜在空间上评估ADAPT，结果表明该方法在层和潜在类型上均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: LLM的特征可视化是可行的，但需要针对该领域进行定制设计。

Abstract: Understanding what features are encoded by learned directions in LLM activation space requires identifying inputs that strongly activate them. Feature visualization, which optimizes inputs to maximally activate a target direction, offers an alternative to costly dataset search approaches, but remains underexplored for LLMs due to the discrete nature of text. Furthermore, existing prompt optimization techniques are poorly suited to this domain, which is highly prone to local minima. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ADAPT, a hybrid method combining beam search initialization with adaptive gradient-guided mutation, designed around these failure modes. We evaluate on Sparse Autoencoder latents from Gemma 2 2B, proposing metrics grounded in dataset activation statistics to enable rigorous comparison, and show that ADAPT consistently outperforms prior methods across layers and latent types. Our results establish that feature visualization for LLMs is tractable, but requires design assumptions tailored to the domain.

Motivation: 为了解决强化学习从人类反馈（RLHF）或可验证奖励（RLVR）在现代语言模型（LM）的后期训练中存在的奖励黑客问题，即策略可能利用奖励的不准确性学习到非预期的行为。

Method: 提出了一种新的方法：通过训练语言模型（LM），使策略更新偏向于奖励更准确的区域。首先，推导了奖励模型准确性与收敛时最优解平坦性之间的理论联系。然后，使用梯度正则化（GR）将训练偏向于更平坦的区域，从而维持奖励模型的准确性。

A common problem is reward hacking, where the policy may exploit inaccuracies of the reward and learn an unintended behavior. Most previous works address this by limiting the policy update with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) penalty towards a reference model. We propose a different framing: Train the LM in a way that biases policy updates towards regions in which the reward is more accurate. First, we derive a theoretical connection between the accuracy of a reward model and the flatness of an optimum at convergence. Gradient regularization (GR) can then be used to bias training to flatter regions and thereby maintain reward model accuracy. We confirm these results by showing that the gradient norm and reward accuracy are empirically correlated in RLHF. We then show that Reference Resets of the KL penalty implicitly use GR to find flatter regions with higher reward accuracy. We further improve on this by proposing to use explicit GR with an efficient finite-difference estimate. Empirically, GR performs better than a KL penalty across a diverse set of RL experiments with LMs. GR achieves a higher GPT-judged win-rate in RLHF, avoids overly focusing on the format in rule-based math rewards, and prevents hacking the judge in LLM-as-a-Judge math tasks.

Motivation: 为了检测LLM在代码生成等任务中的测试作弊行为，研究人员开发了基于LLM的Chain-of-thought (CoT) 监视系统。

Method: 本文采用信息论分析方法，证明了CoT与输出之间的非零互信息是CoT可监视性的必要但不充分条件。同时，识别了两种可能影响CoT监视器性能的近似误差来源：信息差距和诱因误差。

Conclusion: CoT监视系统的可监视性可以通过针对性的训练目标和优化方法得到提高，从而有效地检测LLM在代码生成等任务中的测试作弊行为。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) monitors are LLM-based systems that analyze reasoning traces to detect when outputs may exhibit attributes of interest, such as test-hacking behavior during code generation. In this paper, we use information-theoretic analysis to show that non-zero mutual information between CoT and output is a necessary but not sufficient condition for CoT monitorability. We identify two sources of approximation error that may undermine the performance of CoT monitors in practice: information gap, which measures the extent to which the monitor can extract the information available in CoT, and elicitation error, which measures the extent to which the monitor approximates the optimal monitoring function. We further demonstrate that CoT monitorability can be systematically improved through targeted training objectives. To this end, we propose two complementary approaches: (a) an oracle-based method that directly rewards the monitored model for producing CoTs that maximize monitor accuracy, and (b) a more practical, label-free approach that maximizes conditional mutual information between outputs and CoTs. Across multiple different environments, we show both methods significantly improve monitor accuracy while preventing CoT degeneration even when training against a monitor, thereby mitigating reward hacking when the task reward is imperfectly specified.

Abstract: The paradigm of decision-making has been revolutionised by reinforcement learning and deep learning. Although this has led to significant progress in domains such as robotics, healthcare, and finance, the use of RL in practice is challenging, particularly when learning decision policies in high-stakes applications that may require guarantees. Traditional RL algorithms rely on a large number of online interactions with the environment, which is problematic in scenarios where online interactions are costly, dangerous, or infeasible. However, learning from offline datasets is hindered by the presence of hidden confounders. Such confounders can cause spurious correlations in the dataset and can mislead the agent into taking suboptimal or adversarial actions. Firstly, we address the problem of learning from offline datasets in the presence of hidden confounders. We work with instrumental variables (IVs) to identify the causal effect, which is an instance of a conditional moment restrictions (CMR) problem. Inspired by double/debiased machine learning, we derive a sample-efficient algorithm for solving CMR problems with convergence and optimality guarantees, which outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. Secondly, we relax the conditions on the hidden confounders in the setting of (offline) imitation learning, and adapt our CMR estimator to derive an algorithm that can learn effective imitator policies with convergence rate guarantees. Finally, we consider the problem of learning high-level objectives expressed in linear temporal logic (LTL) and develop a provably optimal learning algorithm that improves sample efficiency over existing methods. Through evaluation on reinforcement learning benchmarks and synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, we demonstrate the usefulness of the methods developed in this thesis in real-world decision making.

Motivation: 针对注意力回归模型训练中PCC（皮尔逊相关系数）损失提升停滞的问题，本文提出了ECA（外推相关注意力）模型。

Method: 通过理论分析，揭示了PCC损失提升停滞的内在原因，并提出了ECA模型。

Result: ECA模型在多个基准测试中取得了显著的PCC提升，同时保持了MSE性能。

Conclusion: ECA模型能够有效解决PCC损失提升停滞问题，并显著提高模型的性能。

Abstract: Attention-based regression models are often trained by jointly optimizing Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) loss, emphasizing the magnitude of errors and the order or shape of targets, respectively. A common but poorly understood phenomenon during training is the PCC plateau: PCC stops improving early in training, even as MSE continues to decrease. We provide the first rigorous theoretical analysis of this behavior, revealing fundamental limitations in both optimization dynamics and model capacity. First, in regard to the flattened PCC curve, we uncover a critical conflict where lowering MSE (magnitude matching) can paradoxically suppress the PCC gradient (shape matching). This issue is exacerbated by the softmax attention mechanism, particularly when the data to be aggregated is highly homogeneous. Second, we identify a limitation in the model capacity: we derived a PCC improvement limit for any convex aggregator (including the softmax attention), showing that the convex hull of the inputs strictly bounds the achievable PCC gain. We demonstrate that data homogeneity intensifies both limitations. Motivated by these insights, we propose the Extrapolative Correlation Attention (ECA), which incorporates novel, theoretically-motivated mechanisms to improve the PCC optimization and extrapolate beyond the convex hull. Across diverse benchmarks, including challenging homogeneous data setting, ECA consistently breaks the PCC plateau, achieving significant improvements in correlation without compromising MSE performance.

Conclusion: 支持未来非自回归seq2seq系统以预测原型token作为中间表示的可行性

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) generate text token-by-token, requiring n forward passes to produce a sequence of length n. Recent work, Exploring the Latent Capacity of LLMs for One-Step Text Reconstruction (Mezentsev and Oseledets), shows that frozen LLMs can reconstruct hundreds of tokens from only two learned proto-tokens in a single forward pass, suggesting a path beyond the autoregressive paradigm. In this paper, we study what information these proto-tokens encode and how they behave under reconstruction and controlled constraints. We perform a series of experiments aimed at disentangling semantic and syntactic content in the two proto-tokens, analyzing stability properties of the e-token, and visualizing attention patterns to the e-token during reconstruction. Finally, we test two regularization schemes for "imposing" semantic structure on the e-token using teacher embeddings, including an anchor-based loss and a relational distillation objective. Our results indicate that the m-token tends to capture semantic information more strongly than the e-token under standard optimization; anchor-based constraints trade off sharply with reconstruction accuracy; and relational distillation can transfer batch-level semantic relations into the proto-token space without sacrificing reconstruction quality, supporting the feasibility of future non-autoregressive seq2seq systems that predict proto-tokens as an intermediate representation.

Abstract: We study a sequential prediction problem in which an adversary is allowed to inject arbitrarily many adversarial instances in a stream of i.i.d.\ instances, but at each round, the learner may also \emph{abstain} from making a prediction without incurring any penalty if the instance was indeed corrupted. This semi-adversarial setting naturally sits between the classical stochastic case with i.i.d.\ instances for which function classes with finite VC dimension are learnable; and the adversarial case with arbitrary instances, known to be significantly more restrictive. For this problem, Goel et al. (2023) showed that, if the learner knows the distribution $μ$ of clean samples in advance, learning can be achieved for all VC classes without restrictions on adversary corruptions. This is, however, a strong assumption in both theory and practice: a natural question is whether similar learning guarantees can be achieved without prior distributional knowledge, as is standard in classical learning frameworks (e.g., PAC learning or asymptotic consistency) and other non-i.i.d.\ models (e.g., smoothed online learning). We therefore focus on the distribution-free setting where $μ$ is \emph{unknown} and propose an algorithm \textsc{AbstainBoost} based on a boosting procedure of weak learners, which guarantees sublinear error for general VC classes in \emph{distribution-free} abstention learning for oblivious adversaries. These algorithms also enjoy similar guarantees for adaptive adversaries, for structured function classes including linear classifiers. These results are complemented with corresponding lower bounds, which reveal an interesting polynomial trade-off between misclassification error and number of erroneous abstentions.

Method: 提出了一种名为PHAST（Port-Hamiltonian Architecture for Structured Temporal dynamics）的模型，该模型通过将哈密顿量分解为势能、质量和阻尼，并使用高效的低秩PSD/SPD参数化，在三个知识领域（已知、部分、未知）中提高动力学。

Result: 在跨越机械、电气、分子、热、重力和生态系统等系统的13个q-only基准测试中，PHAST在长期预测方面优于竞争基线，并在提供足够锚点时实现了物理上有意义的参数恢复。

Conclusion: PHAST模型能够有效地预测耗散物理系统的动力学，并在提供足够结构时恢复物理参数。

Abstract: Real physical systems are dissipative -- a pendulum slows, a circuit loses charge to heat -- and forecasting their dynamics from partial observations is a central challenge in scientific machine learning. We address the \emph{position-only} (q-only) problem: given only generalized positions~$q_t$ at discrete times (momenta~$p_t$ latent), learn a structured model that (a)~produces stable long-horizon forecasts and (b)~recovers physically meaningful parameters when sufficient structure is provided. The port-Hamiltonian framework makes the conservative-dissipative split explicit via $\dot{x}=(J-R)\nabla H(x)$, guaranteeing $dH/dt\le 0$ when $R\succeq 0$. We introduce \textbf{PHAST} (Port-Hamiltonian Architecture for Structured Temporal dynamics), which decomposes the Hamiltonian into potential~$V(q)$, mass~$M(q)$, and damping~$D(q)$ across three knowledge regimes (KNOWN, PARTIAL, UNKNOWN), uses efficient low-rank PSD/SPD parameterizations, and advances dynamics with Strang splitting. Across thirteen q-only benchmarks spanning mechanical, electrical, molecular, thermal, gravitational, and ecological systems, PHAST achieves the best long-horizon forecasting among competitive baselines and enables physically meaningful parameter recovery when the regime provides sufficient anchors. We show that identification is fundamentally ill-posed without such anchors (gauge freedom), motivating a two-axis evaluation that separates forecasting stability from identifiability.

We then specialize to O(d) and evaluate orthogonal-state RNN and transformer models on Tiny Shakespeare and Penn Treebank under parameter-matched settings. We also report a general linear-mixing extension in tangent space, which applies across subgroup choices and improves finite-budget performance in the current O(d) experiments.

Abstract: We study an algorithm-independent, worst-case lower bound for the Gaussian process (GP) bandit problem in the frequentist setting, where the reward function is fixed and has a bounded norm in the known reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Specifically, we focus on the squared exponential (SE) kernel, one of the most widely used kernel functions in GP bandits. One of the remaining open questions for this problem is the gap in the \emph{dimension-dependent} logarithmic factors between upper and lower bounds. This paper partially resolves this open question under a hyperspherical input domain. We show that any algorithm suffers $Ω(\sqrt{T (\ln T)^{d} (\ln \ln T)^{-d}})$ cumulative regret, where $T$ and $d$ represent the total number of steps and the dimension of the hyperspherical domain, respectively. Regarding the simple regret, we show that any algorithm requires $Ω(ε^{-2}(\ln \frac{1}ε)^d (\ln \ln \frac{1}ε)^{-d})$ time steps to find an $ε$-optimal point. We also provide the improved $O((\ln T)^{d+1}(\ln \ln T)^{-d})$ upper bound on the maximum information gain for the SE kernel. Our results guarantee the optimality of the existing best algorithm up to \emph{dimension-independent} logarithmic factors under a hyperspherical input domain.

Abstract: Gradient-based hyperparameter optimization (HPO) have emerged recently, leveraging bilevel programming techniques to optimize hyperparameter by estimating hypergradient w.r.t. validation loss. Nevertheless, previous theoretical works mainly focus on reducing the gap between the estimation and ground-truth (i.e., the bias), while ignoring the error due to data distribution (i.e., the variance), which degrades performance. To address this issue, we conduct a bias-variance decomposition for hypergradient estimation error and provide a supplemental detailed analysis of the variance term ignored by previous works. We also present a comprehensive analysis of the error bounds for hypergradient estimation. This facilitates an easy explanation of some phenomena commonly observed in practice, like overfitting to the validation set. Inspired by the derived theories, we propose an ensemble hypergradient strategy to reduce the variance in HPO algorithms effectively. Experimental results on tasks including regularization hyperparameter learning, data hyper-cleaning, and few-shot learning demonstrate that our variance reduction strategy improves hypergradient estimation. To explain the improved performance, we establish a connection between excess error and hypergradient estimation, offering some understanding of empirical observations.

Abstract: Autonomous (noise-agnostic) generative models, such as Equilibrium Matching and blind diffusion, challenge the standard paradigm by learning a single, time-invariant vector field that operates without explicit noise-level conditioning. While recent work suggests that high-dimensional concentration allows these models to implicitly estimate noise levels from corrupted observations, a fundamental paradox remains: what is the underlying landscape being optimized when the noise level is treated as a random variable, and how can a bounded, noise-agnostic network remain stable near the data manifold where gradients typically diverge? We resolve this paradox by formalizing Marginal Energy, $E_{\text{marg}}(\mathbf{u}) = -\log p(\mathbf{u})$, where $p(\mathbf{u}) = \int p(\mathbf{u}|t)p(t)dt$ is the marginal density of the noisy data integrated over a prior distribution of unknown noise levels. We prove that generation using autonomous models is not merely blind denoising, but a specific form of Riemannian gradient flow on this Marginal Energy. Through a novel relative energy decomposition, we demonstrate that while the raw Marginal Energy landscape possesses a $1/t^p$ singularity normal to the data manifold, the learned time-invariant field implicitly incorporates a local conformal metric that perfectly counteracts the geometric singularity, converting an infinitely deep potential well into a stable attractor. We also establish the structural stability conditions for sampling with autonomous models. We identify a ``Jensen Gap'' in noise-prediction parameterizations that acts as a high-gain amplifier for estimation errors, explaining the catastrophic failure observed in deterministic blind models. Conversely, we prove that velocity-based parameterizations are inherently stable because they satisfy a bounded-gain condition that absorbs posterior uncertainty into a smooth geometric drift.

Motivation: 在深度学习中，清洁准确性和对抗鲁棒性之间的权衡是一个普遍现象，但其几何起源仍然难以捉摸。

Method: 使用对称破缺维度扩展（SBDE）作为可控探针来调查这种权衡背后的机制。SBDE通过插入常数值像素来扩展输入图像，打破平移对称性，并通过减少参数退化来持续提高清洁准确性。然而，这种精度提升是以降低对迭代白盒攻击的鲁棒性为代价的。通过采用测试时掩码投影，将插入的辅助像素重置为其训练值，我们表明这种漏洞几乎完全来自插入的维度。投影有效地中和了攻击并恢复了鲁棒性，揭示了模型通过在辅助轴上创建锐利的边界（陡峭的损失梯度）来实现高精度。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了清洁准确性和对抗鲁棒性之间的权衡，并提供了对这种权衡背后机制的具体几何解释。

Abstract: The trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness is a pervasive phenomenon in deep learning, yet its geometric origin remains elusive. In this work, we utilize Symmetry-Breaking Dimensional Expansion (SBDE) as a controlled probe to investigate the mechanism underlying this trade-off. SBDE expands input images by inserting constant-valued pixels, which breaks translational symmetry and consistently improves clean accuracy (e.g., from $90.47\%$ to $95.63\%$ on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18) by reducing parameter degeneracy. However, this accuracy gain comes at the cost of reduced robustness against iterative white-box attacks. By employing a test-time \emph{mask projection} that resets the inserted auxiliary pixels to their training values, we demonstrate that the vulnerability stems almost entirely from the inserted dimensions. The projection effectively neutralizes the attacks and restores robustness, revealing that the model achieves high accuracy by creating \emph{sharp boundaries} (steep loss gradients) specifically along the auxiliary axes. Our findings provide a concrete geometric explanation for the accuracy-robustness paradox: the optimization landscape deepens the basin of attraction to improve accuracy but inevitably erects steep walls along the auxiliary degrees of freedom, creating a fragile sensitivity to off-manifold perturbations.

Abstract: One-dimensional function approximation is a fundamental problem in scientific computing and engineering applications. While neural networks possess powerful universal approximation capabilities, their optimization process is often hindered by flat loss landscapes induced by parameter-space symmetries, leading to slow convergence and poor generalization, particularly for high-frequency components. Inspired by the principle of \emph{symmetry breaking} in physics, this paper proposes a hardware-friendly approach for function approximation through \emph{input-space expansion}. The core idea involves augmenting the original one-dimensional input (e.g., $x$) with constant values (e.g., $π$) to form a higher-dimensional vector (e.g., $[π, π, x, π, π]$), effectively breaking parameter symmetries without increasing the network's parameter count. We evaluate the method on ten representative one-dimensional functions, including smooth, discontinuous, high-frequency, and non-differentiable functions. Experimental results demonstrate that input-space expansion significantly accelerates training convergence (reducing LBFGS iterations by 12\% on average) and enhances approximation accuracy (reducing final MSE by 66.3\% for the optimal 5D expansion). Ablation studies further reveal the effects of different expansion dimensions and constant selections, with $π$ consistently outperforming other constants. Our work proposes a low-cost, efficient, and hardware-friendly technique for algorithm design.

Abstract: Online model selection in Bayesian bandits raises a fundamental exploration challenge: When an environment instance is sampled from a prior distribution, how can we design an adaptive strategy that explores multiple bandit learners and competes with the best one in hindsight? We address this problem by introducing a new Bayesian algorithm for online model selection in stochastic bandits. We prove an oracle-style guarantee of $O\left( d^* M \sqrt{T} + \sqrt{(MT)} \right)$ on the Bayesian regret, where $M$ is the number of base learners, $d^*$ is the regret coefficient of the optimal base learner, and $T$ is the time horizon. We also validate our method empirically across a range of stochastic bandit settings, demonstrating performance that is competitive with the best base learner. Additionally, we study the effect of sharing data among base learners and its role in mitigating prior mis-specification.

Abstract: Clinical risk prediction models often fail to be generalized across cohorts because underlying data distributions differ by clinical site, region, demographics, and measurement protocols. This limitation is particularly pronounced in hip fracture risk prediction, where the performance of models trained on one cohort (the source cohort) can degrade substantially when deployed in other cohorts (target cohorts). We used a shared set of clinical and DXA-derived features across three large cohorts - the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS), and the UK Biobank (UKB), to systematically evaluate the performance of three domain adaptation methods - Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Correlation Alignment (CORAL), and Domain - Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) and their combinations. For a source cohort with males only and a source cohort with females only, domain-adaptation methods consistently showed improved performance than the no-adaptation baseline (source-only training), and the use of combinations of multiple domain adaptation methods delivered the largest and most stable gains. The method that combines MMD, CORAL, and DANN achieved the highest discrimination with the area under curve (AUC) of 0.88 for a source cohort with males only and 0.95 for a source cohort with females only), demonstrating that integrating multiple domain adaptation methods could produce feature representations that are less sensitive to dataset differences. Unlike existing methods that rely heavily on supervised tuning or assume known outcomes of samples in target cohorts, our outcome-free approaches enable the model selection under realistic deployment conditions and improve generalization of models in hip fracture risk prediction.

Motivation: Generative models have recently demonstrated remarkable success across diverse domains, motivating their adoption as expressive policies in reinforcement learning (RL).

Method: Flow Matching with Injected Noise for Offline-to-Online RL (FINO), leveraging flow matching-based policies to enhance sample efficiency for offline-to-online RL.

Result: Experiments across diverse, challenging tasks demonstrate that FINO consistently achieves superior performance under limited online budgets.

Conclusion: FINO effectively improves the sample efficiency of offline-to-online RL and achieves superior performance in various tasks with limited online budget.

Abstract: Generative models have recently demonstrated remarkable success across diverse domains, motivating their adoption as expressive policies in reinforcement learning (RL). While they have shown strong performance in offline RL, particularly where the target distribution is well defined, their extension to online fine-tuning has largely been treated as a direct continuation of offline pre-training, leaving key challenges unaddressed. In this paper, we propose Flow Matching with Injected Noise for Offline-to-Online RL (FINO), a novel method that leverages flow matching-based policies to enhance sample efficiency for offline-to-online RL. FINO facilitates effective exploration by injecting noise into policy training, thereby encouraging a broader range of actions beyond those observed in the offline dataset. In addition to exploration-enhanced flow policy training, we combine an entropy-guided sampling mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation, allowing the policy to adapt its behavior throughout online fine-tuning. Experiments across diverse, challenging tasks demonstrate that FINO consistently achieves superior performance under limited online budgets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI评估主要关注测量能力，但倾向性在确定性能和安全结果方面起着核心作用。

Method: 引入第一个正式框架来衡量AI倾向性，使用双逻辑公式来衡量模型成功，并使用LLMs和新的任务无关标准来估计理想带的极限。

Result: 该框架可以衡量倾向性的偏移程度及其对任务的影响，并且使用一个基准估计的倾向性可以成功预测新任务的行为。

Conclusion: 这个框架展示了如何进行严格的倾向性测量，并且比仅仅使用能力评估预测AI行为更有优势。

Abstract: AI evaluation has primarily focused on measuring capabilities, with formal approaches inspired from Item Response Theory (IRT) being increasingly applied. Yet propensities - the tendencies of models to exhibit particular behaviours - play a central role in determining both performance and safety outcomes. However, traditional IRT describes a model's success on a task as a monotonic function of model capabilities and task demands, an approach unsuited to propensities, where both excess and deficiency can be problematic. Here, we introduce the first formal framework for measuring AI propensities by using a bilogistic formulation for model success, which attributes high success probability when the model's propensity is within an "ideal band". Further, we estimate the limits of the ideal band using LLMs equipped with newly developed task-agnostic rubrics. Applying our framework to six families of LLM models whose propensities are incited in either direction, we find that we can measure how much the propensity is shifted and what effect this has on the tasks. Critically, propensities estimated using one benchmark successfully predict behaviour on held-out tasks. Moreover, we obtain stronger predictive power when combining propensities and capabilities than either separately. More broadly, our framework showcases how rigorous propensity measurements can be conducted and how it yields gains over solely using capability evaluations to predict AI behaviour.

Conclusion: LERD方法在AD脑电图分析中表现出色，为准确和有临床意义的诊断提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) alters brain electrophysiology and disrupts multichannel EEG dynamics, making accurate and clinically useful EEG-based diagnosis increasingly important for screening and disease monitoring. However, many existing approaches rely on black-box classifiers and do not explicitly model the underlying dynamics that generate observed signals. To address these limitations, we propose LERD, an end-to-end Bayesian electrophysiological neural dynamical system that infers latent neural events and their relational structure directly from multichannel EEG without event or interaction annotations. LERD combines a continuous-time event inference module with a stochastic event-generation process to capture flexible temporal patterns, while incorporating an electrophysiology-inspired dynamical prior to guide learning in a principled way. We further provide theoretical analysis that yields a tractable bound for training and stability guarantees for the inferred relational dynamics. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and two real-world AD EEG cohorts demonstrate that LERD consistently outperforms strong baselines and yields physiology-aligned latent summaries that help characterize group-level dynamical differences.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential in multi-agent negotiation tasks, yet evaluation in this domain remains challenging due to a lack of robust and generalizable benchmarks. Abdelnabi et al. (2024) introduce a negotiation benchmark based on Scoreable Games, with the aim of developing a highly complex and realistic evaluation framework for LLMs. Our work investigates the reproducibility of claims in their benchmark, and provides a deeper understanding of its usability and generalizability. We replicate the original experiments on additional models, and introduce additional metrics to verify negotiation quality and evenness of evaluation. Our findings reveal that while the benchmark is indeed complex, model comparison is ambiguous, raising questions about its objectivity. Furthermore, we identify limitations in the experimental setup, particularly in information leakage detection and thoroughness of the ablation study. By examining and analyzing the behavior of a wider range of models on an extended version of the benchmark, we reveal insights that provide additional context to potential users. Our results highlight the importance of context in model-comparative evaluations.

Abstract: Heavy-tailed stochastic gradient noise, commonly observed in transformer models, can destabilize the optimization process. Recent works mainly focus on developing and understanding approaches to address heavy-tailed noise in the centralized or distributed, synchronous setting, leaving the interactions between such noise and asynchronous optimization underexplored. In this work, we investigate two communication schemes that handle stragglers with asynchronous updates in the presence of heavy-tailed gradient noise. We propose and theoretically analyze algorithmic modifications based on delay-aware learning rate scheduling and delay compensation to enhance the performance of asynchronous algorithms. Our convergence guarantees under heavy-tailed noise match the rate of the synchronous counterparts and improve delay tolerance compared with existing asynchronous approaches. Empirically, our approaches outperform prior synchronous and asynchronous methods in terms of accuracy/runtime trade-offs and are more robust to hyperparameters in both image and language tasks.

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架和方法有效提升了Dual-to-Dual MLLMs的持续学习能力。

Abstract: Dual-to-Dual MLLMs refer to Multimodal Large Language Models, which can enable unified multimodal comprehension and generation through text and image modalities. Although exhibiting strong instantaneous learning and generalization capabilities, Dual-to-Dual MLLMs still remain deficient in lifelong evolution, significantly affecting continual adaptation to dynamic real-world scenarios. One of the challenges is that learning new tasks inevitably destroys the learned knowledge. Beyond traditional catastrophic forgetting, Dual-to-Dual MLLMs face other challenges, including hallucination, instruction unfollowing, and failures in cross-modal knowledge transfer. However, no standardized continual learning framework for Dual-to-Dual MLLMs has been established yet, leaving these challenges unexplored. Thus, in this paper, we establish Continual-NExT, a continual learning framework for Dual-to-Dual MLLMs with deliberately-architected evaluation metrics. To improve the continual learning capability of Dual-to-Dual MLLMs, we propose an efficient MAGE (Mixture and Aggregation of General LoRA and Expert LoRA) method to further facilitate knowledge transfer across modalities and mitigate forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGE outperforms other continual learning methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Decoding sits between a language model and everything we do with it, yet it is still treated as a heuristic knob-tuning exercise. We argue decoding should be understood as a principled optimisation layer: at each token, we solve a regularised problem over the probability simplex that trades off model score against structural preferences and constraints. This single template recovers greedy decoding, Softmax sampling, Top-K, Top-P, and Sparsemax-style sparsity as special cases, and explains their common structure through optimality conditions. More importantly, the framework makes it easy to invent new decoders without folklore. We demonstrate this by designing Best-of-K (BoK), a KL-anchored coverage objective aimed at multi-sample pipelines (self-consistency, reranking, verifier selection). BoK targets the probability of covering good alternatives within a fixed K-sample budget and improves empirical performance. We show that such samples can improve accuracy by, for example, +18.6% for Qwen2.5-Math-7B on MATH500 at high sampling temperatures.

Method: 从等变离散流匹配模型出发，通过正弦位置编码和节点排列的对称性调制方案来放松等变性。

Result: 实验表明，破坏对称性可以加速早期训练，但可能导致过拟合；适当调制对称性信号可以延迟过拟合并加速收敛，使模型在基线训练周期数减少19%的情况下达到更强的性能。

Conclusion: 等变性在图生成模型中至关重要，但需要平衡其带来的计算成本和收敛速度。

Abstract: Equivariance is central to graph generative models, as it ensures the model respects the permutation symmetry of graphs. However, strict equivariance can increase computational cost due to added architectural constraints, and can slow down convergence because the model must be consistent across a large space of possible node permutations. We study this trade-off for graph generative models. Specifically, we start from an equivariant discrete flow-matching model, and relax its equivariance during training via a controllable symmetry modulation scheme based on sinusoidal positional encodings and node permutations. Experiments first show that symmetry-breaking can accelerate early training by providing an easier learning signal, but at the expense of encouraging shortcut solutions that can cause overfitting, where the model repeatedly generates graphs that are duplicates of the training set. On the contrary, properly modulating the symmetry signal can delay overfitting while accelerating convergence, allowing the model to reach stronger performance with $19\%$ of the baseline training epochs.

Conclusion: JPmHC是一种灵活且可扩展的HC扩展，它提高了谱感知、稳定和高效的深度学习，为拓扑架构设计和基础模型进化提供了见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning, exemplified by Hyper-Connections (HC), have expanded the residual connection paradigm by introducing wider residual streams and diverse connectivity patterns. While these innovations yield significant performance gains, they compromise the identity mapping property of residual connections, leading to training instability, limited scalability, and increased memory overhead. To address these challenges, we propose JPmHC (Jacobian-spectrum Preserving manifold-constrained Hyper-Connections), a framework that replaces identity skips with a trainable linear mixer acting on n parallel streams while explicitly controlling gradient conditioning. By constraining the mixer M on operator-norm-bounded manifolds (e.g., bistochastic, Stiefel, Grassmann), JPmHC prevents gradient pathologies and enhances stability. JPmHC introduces three key contributions: (i) a free-probability analysis that predicts Jacobian spectra for structured skips, providing actionable design rules for mixer selection; (ii) memory-efficient implicit differentiation for fixed-point projections, reducing activation memory and synchronization overhead; and (iii) a Stiefel-constrained mixer via Cayley transforms, ensuring orthogonality without post-hoc normalization. Empirical evaluations on ARC-AGI demonstrate that JPmHC achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, and lower computational cost compared to bistochastic baselines. As a flexible and scalable extension of HC, JPmHC advances spectrum-aware, stable, and efficient deep learning, offering insights into topological architecture design and foundational model evolution.

Abstract: We study online resource allocation under non-stationary demand with a minimum offline data requirement. In this problem, a decision-maker must allocate multiple types of resources to sequentially arriving queries over a finite horizon. Each query belongs to a finite set of types with fixed resource consumption and a stochastic reward drawn from an unknown, type-specific distribution. Critically, the environment exhibits arbitrary non-stationarity -- arrival distributions may shift unpredictably-while the algorithm requires only one historical sample per period to operate effectively. We distinguish two settings based on sample informativeness: (i) reward-observed samples containing both query type and reward realization, and (ii) the more challenging type-only samples revealing only query type information.
  We propose a novel type-dependent quantile-based meta-policy that decouples the problem into modular components: reward distribution estimation, optimization of target service probabilities via fluid relaxation, and real-time decisions through dynamic acceptance thresholds. For reward-observed samples, our static threshold policy achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. For type-only samples, we first establish that sublinear regret is impossible without additional structure; under a mild minimum-arrival-probability assumption, we design both a partially adaptive policy attaining the same $\tilde{O}({T})$ bound and, more significantly, a fully adaptive resolving policy with careful rounding that achieves the first poly-logarithmic regret guarantee of $O((\log T)^3)$ for non-stationary multi-resource allocation. Our framework advances prior work by operating with minimal offline data (one sample per period), handling arbitrary non-stationarity without variation-budget assumptions, and supporting multiple resource constraints.

Motivation: 为了解决在资源受限的物联网环境中，由于数据分布不均匀导致的客户端漂移问题，影响模型收敛速度和性能。

Method: 提出了Federated Zero Mean Gradients（FedZMG），一种新型的参数-free客户端优化算法，通过结构化正则化优化空间来应对客户端漂移。该方法借鉴了梯度集中化的思想，将局部梯度投影到零均值超平面上，从而在无需额外通信或超参数调整的情况下，有效消除异构数据分布中的“强度”或“偏差”偏移。

Conclusion: FedZMG是一种有效应对客户端漂移问题的新型联邦学习优化算法，能够提高资源受限的物联网环境中的模型收敛速度和性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed model training on edge devices while preserving data privacy. However, clients tend to have non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data, which often leads to client-drift, and therefore diminishing convergence speed and model performance. While adaptive optimizers have been proposed to mitigate these effects, they frequently introduce computational complexity or communication overhead unsuitable for resource-constrained IoT environments. This paper introduces Federated Zero Mean Gradients (FedZMG), a novel, parameter-free, client-side optimization algorithm designed to tackle client-drift by structurally regularizing the optimization space. Advancing the idea of Gradient Centralization, FedZMG projects local gradients onto a zero-mean hyperplane, effectively neutralizing the "intensity" or "bias" shifts inherent in heterogeneous data distributions without requiring additional communication or hyperparameter tuning. A theoretical analysis is provided, proving that FedZMG reduces the effective gradient variance and guarantees tighter convergence bounds compared to standard FedAvg. Extensive empirical evaluations on EMNIST, CIFAR100, and Shakespeare datasets demonstrate that FedZMG achieves better convergence speed and final validation accuracy compared to the baseline FedAvg and the adaptive optimizer FedAdam, particularly in highly non-IID settings.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to propagate information across long distances due to oversmoothing and oversquashing. Existing remedies such as graph transformers or rewiring typically incur high computational cost or require altering the graph structure. We introduce a Bakry-Emery graph Laplacian that integrates diffusion and advection through a learnable node-wise potential, inducing task-dependent propagation dynamics without modifying topology. This operator has a well-behaved spectral decomposition and acts as a drop-in replacement for standard Laplacians in spectral GNNs. Building on this insight, we develop mu-ChebNet, a spectral architecture that jointly learns the potential and Chebyshev filters, effectively bridging message-passing adaptivity and spectral efficiency. Our theoretical analysis shows how the potential modulates the spectrum, enabling control of key graph properties. Empirically, mu-ChebNet delivers consistent gains on synthetic long-range reasoning tasks, as well as real-world benchmarks, while offering an interpretable routing field that reveals how information flows through the graph. This establishes the Bakry-Emery Laplacian as a principled and efficient foundation for adaptive spectral graph learning.

Abstract: Previous work has explored the computational complexity of deriving two fundamental types of explanations for ML model predictions: (1) *sufficient reasons*, which are subsets of input features that, when fixed, determine a prediction, and (2) *contrastive reasons*, which are subsets of input features that, when modified, alter a prediction. Prior studies have examined these explanations in different contexts, such as non-probabilistic versus probabilistic frameworks and local versus global settings. In this study, we introduce a unified framework for analyzing these explanations, demonstrating that they can all be characterized through the minimization of a unified probabilistic value function. We then prove that the complexity of these computations is influenced by three key properties of the value function: (1) *monotonicity*, (2) *submodularity*, and (3) *supermodularity* - which are three fundamental properties in *combinatorial optimization*. Our findings uncover some counterintuitive results regarding the nature of these properties within the explanation settings examined. For instance, although the *local* value functions do not exhibit monotonicity or submodularity/supermodularity whatsoever, we demonstrate that the *global* value functions do possess these properties. This distinction enables us to prove a series of novel polynomial-time results for computing various explanations with provable guarantees in the global explainability setting, across a range of ML models that span the interpretability spectrum, such as neural networks, decision trees, and tree ensembles. In contrast, we show that even highly simplified versions of these explanations become NP-hard to compute in the corresponding local explainability setting.

Abstract: This work presents a new approach to decentralized training-SeedFlood-designed to scale for large models across complex network topologies and achieve global consensus with minimal communication overhead. Traditional gossip-based methods suffer from message communication costs that grow with model size, while information decay over network hops renders global consensus inefficient. SeedFlood departs from these practices by exploiting the seed-reconstructible structure of zeroth-order updates and effectively making the messages near-zero in size, allowing them to be flooded to every client in the network. This mechanism makes communication overhead negligible and independent of model size, removing the primary scalability bottleneck in decentralized training. Consequently, SeedFlood enables training in regimes previously considered impractical, such as billion-parameter models distributed across hundreds of clients. Our experiments on decentralized LLM fine-tuning demonstrate thatSeedFlood consistently outperforms gossip-based baselines in both generalization performance and communication efficiency, and even achieves results comparable to first-order methods in large scale settings.

Result: RAT+在1.5B参数和100B个token上训练，在16和64的扩张注意力下，与密集精度相近，在常识推理和LongBench任务上分别下降约2-3个百分点。

Conclusion: RAT+在保持推理效率的同时，提高了结构化扩张注意力的准确性。

Abstract: Structured dilated attention has an appealing inference-time efficiency knob: it reduces the FLOPs of the attention and the KV cache size by a factor of the dilation size D, while preserving long-range connectivity. However, we find a persistent failure mode of them -- sparsifying a pretrained attention model to a dilated pattern leads to severe accuracy degradation. We introduce RAT+, a dense-pretraining architecture that augments attention with full-sequence recurrence and active recurrence learning. A single RAT+ model is pretrained densely once, then flexibly switched at inference time to dilated attention (optionally with local windows) or hybrid layer/head compositions, requiring only a short 1B-token resolution adaptation rather than retraining separate sparse models. At 1.5B parameters trained on 100B tokens, RAT+ closely matches dense accuracy at 16 and drops by about 2-3 points at 64 on commonsense reasoning and LongBench tasks, respectively. Moreover, RAT+ outperforms attention when sparsifying to the top-k block attention. We further scale to 2.6B parameters and 200B tokens and observe the same trend.

Conclusion: 该研究为解决计算单元未能显式携带不确定性的问题提供了一种新的思路，并有望提高序列生成中的因果关系组织。

Abstract: We propose a proof of concept for a variational distributional neuron: a compute unit formulated as a VAE brick, explicitly carrying a prior, an amortized posterior and a local ELBO. The unit is no longer a deterministic scalar but a distribution: computing is no longer about propagating values, but about contracting a continuous space of possibilities under constraints. Each neuron parameterizes a posterior, propagates a reparameterized sample and is regularized by the KL term of a local ELBO - hence, the activation is distributional. This "contraction" becomes testable through local constraints and can be monitored via internal measures. The amount of contextual information carried by the unit, as well as the temporal persistence of this information, are locally tuned by distinct constraints. This proposal addresses a structural tension: in sequential generation, causality is predominantly organized in the symbolic space and, even when latents exist, they often remain auxiliary, while the effective dynamics are carried by a largely deterministic decoder. In parallel, probabilistic latent models capture factors of variation and uncertainty, but that uncertainty typically remains borne by global or parametric mechanisms, while units continue to propagate scalars - hence the pivot question: if uncertainty is intrinsic to computation, why does the compute unit not carry it explicitly? We therefore draw two axes: (i) the composition of probabilistic constraints, which must be made stable, interpretable and controllable; and (ii) granularity: if inference is a negotiation of distributions under constraints, should the primitive unit remain deterministic or become distributional? We analyze "collapse" modes and the conditions for a "living neuron", then extend the contribution over time via autoregressive priors over the latent, per unit.

Conclusion: 为无监督学习自动化提供实用的决策透明度提高基础

Abstract: AutoClustering methods aim to automate unsupervised learning tasks, including algorithm selection (AS), hyperparameter optimization (HPO), and pipeline synthesis (PS), by often leveraging meta-learning over dataset meta-features. While these systems often achieve strong performance, their recommendations are often difficult to justify: the influence of dataset meta-features on algorithm and hyperparameter choices is typically not exposed, limiting reliability, bias diagnostics, and efficient meta-feature engineering. This limits reliability and diagnostic insight for further improvements. In this work, we investigate the explainability of the meta-models in AutoClustering. We first review 22 existing methods and organize their meta-features into a structured taxonomy. We then apply a global explainability technique (i.e., Decision Predicate Graphs) to assess feature importance within meta-models from selected frameworks. Finally, we use local explainability tools such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to analyse specific clustering decisions. Our findings highlight consistent patterns in meta-feature relevance, identify structural weaknesses in current meta-learning strategies that can distort recommendations, and provide actionable guidance for more interpretable Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) design. This study therefore offers a practical foundation for increasing decision transparency in unsupervised learning automation.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of main engine power is essential for vessel performance optimization, fuel efficiency, and compliance with emission regulations. Conventional machine learning approaches, such as Support Vector Machines, variants of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and tree-based methods like Random Forests, Extra Tree Regressors, and XGBoost, can capture nonlinearities but often struggle to respect the fundamental propeller law relationship between power and speed, resulting in poor extrapolation outside the training envelope. This study introduces a hybrid modeling framework that integrates physics-based knowledge from sea trials with data-driven residual learning. The baseline component, derived from calm-water power curves of the form $P = cV^n$, captures the dominant power-speed dependence, while another, nonlinear, regressor is then trained to predict the residual power, representing deviations caused by environmental and operational conditions. By constraining the machine learning task to residual corrections, the hybrid model simplifies learning, improves generalization, and ensures consistency with the underlying physics. In this study, an XGBoost, a simple Neural Network, and a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) coupled with the baseline component were compared to identical models without the baseline component. Validation on in-service data demonstrates that the hybrid model consistently outperformed a pure data-driven baseline in sparse data regions while maintaining similar performance in populated ones. The proposed framework provides a practical and computationally efficient tool for vessel performance monitoring, with applications in weather routing, trim optimization, and energy efficiency planning.

Motivation: 聚类在无监督结构发现中广泛使用，但对其可靠性的理解有限。

Method: 提出CAKE框架，通过聚类集成计算分配稳定性与局部几何拟合一致性。

Result: CAKE能够有效突出模糊点和稳定核心成员，提供置信度排名，以指导过滤或优先级排序，提高聚类质量。

Conclusion: CAKE框架在噪声下有效，并能区分稳定和不稳定点。

Abstract: Clustering is widely used for unsupervised structure discovery, yet it offers limited insight into how reliable each individual assignment is. Diagnostics, such as convergence behavior or objective values, may reflect global quality, but they do not indicate whether particular instances are assigned confidently, especially for initialization-sensitive algorithms like k-means. This assignment-level instability can undermine both accuracy and robustness. Ensemble approaches improve global consistency by aggregating multiple runs, but they typically lack tools for quantifying pointwise confidence in a way that combines cross-run agreement with geometric support from the learned cluster structure. We introduce CAKE (Confidence in Assignments via K-partition Ensembles), a framework that evaluates each point using two complementary statistics computed over a clustering ensemble: assignment stability and consistency of local geometric fit. These are combined into a single, interpretable score in [0,1]. Our theoretical analysis shows that CAKE remains effective under noise and separates stable from unstable points. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets indicate that CAKE effectively highlights ambiguous points and stable core members, providing a confidence ranking that can guide filtering or prioritization to improve clustering quality.

### [126] [Exploiting Liquidity Exhaustion Attacks in Intent-Based Cross-Chain Bridges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17805)

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的攻击方法，分析了跨链桥接系统的风险，并提出了降低攻击成本的优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决基于意图的跨链桥接系统引入的新系统风险，如解算者流动性集中和延迟结算。

Method: 提出了一种新的攻击类型，称为流动性耗尽攻击，并建立了一个基于重放的参数化攻击模拟框架。

Result: 分析了350万个跨链意图，涉及9个区块链，价值92.4亿美元的代币。发现某些协议在当前参数下容易受到攻击，而其他协议则相对稳健。

Conclusion: 针对流动性耗尽攻击，提出了一种优化的攻击策略，可降低攻击成本90.5%。

Abstract: Intent-based cross-chain bridges have emerged as an alternative to traditional interoperability protocols by allowing off-chain entities (\emph{solvers}) to immediately fulfill users' orders by fronting their own liquidity. While improving user experience, this approach introduces new systemic risks, such as solver liquidity concentration and delayed settlement. In this paper, we propose a new class of attacks called \emph{liquidity exhaustion attacks} and a replay-based parameterized attack simulation framework. We analyze 3.5 million cross-chain intents that moved \$9.24B worth of tokens between June and November 2025 across three major protocols (Mayan Swift, Across, and deBridge), spanning nine blockchains.
  For rational attackers, our results show that protocols with higher solver profitability, such as deBridge, are vulnerable under current parameters: 210 historical attack instances yield a mean net profit of \$286.14, with 80.5\% of attacks profitable. In contrast, Across remains robust in all tested configurations due to low solver margins and very high liquidity, while Mayan Swift is generally secure but becomes vulnerable under stress-test conditions. Under byzantine attacks, we show that it is possible to suppress availability across all protocols, causing dozens of failed intents and solver profit losses of up to \$978 roughly every 16 minutes. Finally, we propose an optimized attack strategy that exploits patterns in the data to reduce attack costs by up to 90.5\% compared to the baseline, lowering the barrier to liquidity exhaustion attacks.

Abstract: This submission includes a complete reference implementation together with deterministic test vectors and a reproducible benchmark suite. All source code, build instructions, and regression artifacts are publicly available in the project repository, enabling independent verification and reimplementation of the scheme. The AEAD construction is fully specified, including domain separation, rate and capacity choices, tag generation, and the exact file format used by the reference CLI. Reported performance numbers are produced by the built in benchmark tool under documented hardware and compiler settings. All security claims are made strictly within the ideal permutation model following standard sponge and duplex bounds, and no stronger guarantees are asserted for the concrete permutation beyond the documented analysis and empirical behavior. The implementation aims for constant time behavior with respect to secret dependent operations, although no formal side channel proof is provided. The project is released under the MIT license, and external cryptanalysis, feedback, and reproducibility checks are explicitly encouraged.

Abstract: Over the past four decades, distributed security has undergone a remarkable transformation -- from crash-fault tolerant protocols designed for controlled environments to sophisticated Byzantine-resilient architectures operating in open, adversarial settings. This vision paper examines this evolution and argues for a fundamental shift in how we approach distributed security: from studying individual security properties in isolation to understanding their synergistic combinations. We begin by conclude four foundational properties, \textit{agreement, consistency, privacy, verifiability, accountability}. We trace their theoretical origins and practical maturation. We then demonstrate how the frontier of research now lies at the intersection of these properties, where their fusion creates capabilities that neither property could achieve alone. Looking forward, we identify critical research challenges: discovering new security properties driven by emerging applications, developing systematic frameworks for property convergence, managing the computational overhead of cryptographic primitives in high-performance consensus layers, and addressing post-quantum and human-factor challenges. The future of distributed security lies not in improving individual properties, but in understanding and harnessing their synergies to build a singular fabric of trust.

Abstract: Many adversarial attacks on autonomous-driving perception models fail to cause system-level failures once deployed in a full driving stack. The main reason for such ineffectiveness is that once deployed in a system (e.g., within a simulator), attacks tend to be spatially or temporally short-lived, due to the vehicle's dynamics, hence rarely influencing the vehicle behaviour. In this paper, we address both limitations by introducing a system-level attack in which multiple dynamic elements (e.g., two pedestrians) carry adversarial patches (e.g., on cloths) and jointly amplify their effect through coordination and motion. We evaluate our attacks in the CARLA simulator using a state-of-the-art autonomous driving agent. At the system level, single-pedestrian attacks fail in all runs (out of 10), while dynamic collusion by two pedestrians induces full vehicle stops in up to 50\% of runs, with static collusion yielding no successful attack at all. These results show that system-level failures arise only when adversarial signals persist over time and are amplified through coordinated actors, exposing a gap between model-level robustness and end-to-end safety.

Conclusion: WebAssembly可以作为一种隐藏恶意负载和规避检测的新技术。

Abstract: In recent years, stealthy Android malware has increasingly adopted sophisticated techniques to bypass automatic detection mechanisms and harden manual analysis. Adversaries typically rely on obfuscation, anti-repacking, steganography, poisoning, and evasion techniques to AI-based tools, and in-memory execution to conceal malicious functionality.
  In this paper, we investigate WebAssembly (Wasm) as a novel technique for hiding malicious payloads and evading traditional static analysis and signature-matching mechanisms. While Wasm is typically employed to render specific gaming activities and interact with the native components in web browsers, we provide an in-depth analysis on the mechanisms Android may employ to include Wasm modules in its execution pipeline. Additionally, we provide Proofs-of-Concept to demonstrate a threat model in which an attacker embeds and executes malicious routines, effectively bypassing IoC detection by industrial state-of-the-art tools, like VirusTotal and MobSF.

Abstract: Static security analysis is a widely used technique for detecting software vulnerabilities across a wide range of weaknesses, application domains, and programming languages. While prior work surveyed static analyzes for specific weaknesses or application domains, no overview of the entire security landscape exists. We present a systematic literature review of 246 static security analyzers concerning their targeted vulnerabilities, application domains, analysis techniques, evaluation methods, and limitations. We observe that most analyzers focus on a limited set of weaknesses, that the vulnerabilities they detect are rarely exploitable, and that evaluations use custom benchmarks that are too small to enable robust assessment.

Conclusion: 证明了在编程语言中使用AST集成和微调预训练模型的重要性。

Abstract: With the emergence of remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in ubiquitous libraries and advanced social engineering techniques, threat actors have started conducting widespread fileless cryptojacking attacks. These attacks have become effective with stealthy techniques based on PowerShell-based exploitation in Windows OS environments. Even if attacks are detected and malicious scripts removed, processes may remain operational on victim endpoints, creating a significant challenge for detection mechanisms. In this paper, we conducted an experimental study with a collected dataset on detecting PowerShell-based fileless cryptojacking scripts. The results showed that Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based fine-tuned CodeBERT achieved a high recall rate, proving the importance of the use of AST integration and fine-tuned pre-trained models for programming language.

Abstract: The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) launched the TrojAI program to confront an emerging vulnerability in modern artificial intelligence: the threat of AI Trojans. These AI trojans are malicious, hidden backdoors intentionally embedded within an AI model that can cause a system to fail in unexpected ways, or allow a malicious actor to hijack the AI model at will. This multi-year initiative helped to map out the complex nature of the threat, pioneered foundational detection methods, and identified unsolved challenges that require ongoing attention by the burgeoning AI security field. This report synthesizes the program's key findings, including methodologies for detection through weight analysis and trigger inversion, as well as approaches for mitigating Trojan risks in deployed models. Comprehensive test and evaluation results highlight detector performance, sensitivity, and the prevalence of "natural" Trojans. The report concludes with lessons learned and recommendations for advancing AI security research.

Motivation: 在敏感领域（如产品推荐、医疗和金融）中，模型在机密数据上训练并检索影响推理行为的私有特征，但隐藏于API调用者。

Method: 通过端到端时间推断私有后端检索特征，不依赖于功耗分析、DVFS操作或共享缓存侧信道。

Result: 在医疗和非医疗领域的三个数据集上评估了FEATUREBLEED，并证明了其在CPU和GPU加速器、数据模态和应用领域中的通用性，对抗优势高达98.87个百分点。

Conclusion: 提出了一种名为FEATUREBLEED的硬件级后端检索数据窃取攻击，该攻击利用AI加速器中的零跳过特性，仅通过端到端时间推断私有后端检索特征，从而直接威胁数据机密性并绕过最先进的隐私防御措施。

Abstract: Backend enrichment is now widely deployed in sensitive domains such as product recommendation pipelines, healthcare, and finance, where models are trained on confidential data and retrieve private features whose values influence inference behavior while remaining hidden from the API caller. This paper presents the first hardware-level backend retrieval data-stealing attack, showing that accelerator optimizations designed for performance can directly undermine data confidentiality and bypass state-of-the-art privacy defenses.
  Our attack, FEATUREBLEED, exploits zero-skipping in AI accelerators to infer private backend-retrieved features solely through end-to-end timing, without relying on power analysis, DVFS manipulation, or shared-cache side channels. We evaluate FEATUREBLEED on three datasets spanning medical and non-medical domains: Texas-100X (clinical records), OrganAMNIST (medical imaging), and Census-19 (socioeconomic data). We further evaluate FEATUREBLEED across three hardware backends (Intel AVX, Intel AMX, and NVIDIA A100) and three model architectures (DNNs, CNNs, and hybrid CNN-MLP pipelines), demonstrating that the leakage generalizes across CPU and GPU accelerators, data modalities, and application domains, with an adversarial advantage of up to 98.87 percentage points.
  Finally, we identify the root cause of the leakage as sparsity-driven zero-skipping in modern hardware. We quantify the privacy-performance-power trade-off: disabling zero-skipping increases Intel AMX per-operation energy by up to 25 percent and incurs 100 percent performance overhead. We propose a padding-based defense that masks timing leakage by equalizing responses to the worst-case execution time, achieving protection with only 7.24 percent average performance overhead and no additional power cost.

Motivation: 在需要可验证推理的高风险专业领域，语言模型存在基本局限性，如幻觉、脆弱性和缺乏形式化基础，这特别成问题。

Method: 通过检索增强生成，研究形式化领域本体是否可以增强语言模型的可靠性。使用数学作为概念验证，实现一个神经符号管道，利用OpenMath本体，结合混合检索和交叉编码重排序，将相关定义注入模型提示中。

Result: 在MATH基准测试中，与三个开源模型相比，当检索质量高时，本体引导的上下文可以改善性能；但无关的上下文会主动降低性能，突显了神经符号方法的潜力与挑战。

Conclusion: 本体引导的上下文可以增强语言模型的可靠性，但检索质量和上下文的相关性对性能有重要影响。

Abstract: Language models exhibit fundamental limitations -- hallucination, brittleness, and lack of formal grounding -- that are particularly problematic in high-stakes specialist fields requiring verifiable reasoning. I investigate whether formal domain ontologies can enhance language model reliability through retrieval-augmented generation. Using mathematics as proof of concept, I implement a neuro-symbolic pipeline leveraging the OpenMath ontology with hybrid retrieval and cross-encoder reranking to inject relevant definitions into model prompts. Evaluation on the MATH benchmark with three open-source models reveals that ontology-guided context improves performance when retrieval quality is high, but irrelevant context actively degrades it -- highlighting both the promise and challenges of neuro-symbolic approaches.

Result: 在TTG上评估了10个前沿模型，其排名与现有基准测试（如Humanity's Last Exam）的排名相匹配，且无需人工创建谜题。

Conclusion: 这项工作提出了新的评估推理的范式，这些范式无法通过设计来饱和，并允许测试模型的其他技能，如创造力和任务创建，以及问题解决能力。

Abstract: Evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models is increasingly challenging as models improve. Human curation of hard questions is highly expensive, especially in recent benchmarks using PhD-level domain knowledge to challenge the most capable models. Even then, there is always a concern about whether these questions test genuine reasoning or if similar problems have been seen during training. Here, we take inspiration from 16th-century mathematical duels to design The Token Games (TTG): an evaluation framework where models challenge each other by creating their own puzzles. We leverage the format of Programming Puzzles - given a Python function that returns a boolean, find inputs that make it return True - to flexibly represent problems and enable verifying solutions. Using results from pairwise duels, we then compute Elo ratings, allowing us to compare models relative to each other. We evaluate 10 frontier models on TTG, and closely match the ranking from existing benchmarks such as Humanity's Last Exam, without involving any human effort in creating puzzles. We also find that creating good puzzles is still a highly challenging task for current models, not measured by previous benchmarks. Overall, our work suggests new paradigms for evaluating reasoning that cannot be saturated by design, and that allow testing models for other skills like creativity and task creation alongside problem solving.

Conclusion: WorkflowPerturb provides a controlled benchmark for workflow evaluation metrics, improving the understanding of metric sensitivity and calibration.

Abstract: LLM-based systems increasingly generate structured workflows for complex tasks. In practice, automatic evaluation of these workflows is difficult, because metric scores are often not calibrated, and score changes do not directly communicate the severity of workflow degradation. We introduce WorkflowPerturb, a controlled benchmark for studying workflow evaluation metrics. It works by applying realistic, controlled perturbations to golden workflows. WorkflowPerturb contains 4,973 golden workflows and 44,757 perturbed variants across three perturbation types (Missing Steps, Compressed Steps, and Description Changes), each applied at severity levels of 10%, 30%, and 50%. We benchmark multiple metric families and analyze their sensitivity and calibration using expected score trajectories and residuals. Our results characterize systematic differences across metric families and support severity-aware interpretation of workflow evaluation scores. Our dataset will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: Combining offline RL and cross-embodiment learning improves robot policy pre-training, but requires addressing conflicting gradients and inter-robot conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalable robot policy pre-training has been hindered by the high cost of collecting high-quality demonstrations for each platform.

Method: Uniting offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) with cross-embodiment learning. Offline RL leverages both expert and abundant suboptimal data, and cross-embodiment learning aggregates heterogeneous robot trajectories across diverse morphologies to acquire universal control priors.

Result: Combined approach excels at pre-training with datasets rich in suboptimal trajectories, outperforming pure behavior cloning. However, conflicting gradients across morphologies begin to impede learning as the proportion of suboptimal data and the number of robot types increase. Embodiment-based grouping strategy reduces inter-robot conflicts and outperforms existing conflict-resolution methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining offline RL and cross-embodiment learning for scalable robot policy pre-training, but also highlights the challenges of handling conflicting gradients and introduces a novel embodiment-based grouping strategy to address this issue.

Abstract: Scalable robot policy pre-training has been hindered by the high cost of collecting high-quality demonstrations for each platform. In this study, we address this issue by uniting offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) with cross-embodiment learning. Offline RL leverages both expert and abundant suboptimal data, and cross-embodiment learning aggregates heterogeneous robot trajectories across diverse morphologies to acquire universal control priors. We perform a systematic analysis of this offline RL and cross-embodiment paradigm, providing a principled understanding of its strengths and limitations. To evaluate this offline RL and cross-embodiment paradigm, we construct a suite of locomotion datasets spanning 16 distinct robot platforms. Our experiments confirm that this combined approach excels at pre-training with datasets rich in suboptimal trajectories, outperforming pure behavior cloning. However, as the proportion of suboptimal data and the number of robot types increase, we observe that conflicting gradients across morphologies begin to impede learning. To mitigate this, we introduce an embodiment-based grouping strategy in which robots are clustered by morphological similarity and the model is updated with a group gradient. This simple, static grouping substantially reduces inter-robot conflicts and outperforms existing conflict-resolution methods.

Motivation: 为了研究无监督表示是否对敏感属性中性，即使这些属性在训练中未包含。

Method: 使用SOMtime，一种基于高容量自组织图（Self-Organizing Maps）的拓扑保持表示方法。

Result: SOMtime在两个大规模真实世界数据集上恢复与隐藏敏感属性一致的单调顺序，与PCA、UMAP和t-SNE及自动编码器相比，SOMtime的Spearman相关性最高可达0.85。

Conclusion: 无监督表示中的公平性审计必须扩展到机器学习管道的无监督组件。

Abstract: Unsupervised representations are widely assumed to be neutral with respect to sensitive attributes when those attributes are withheld from training. We show that this assumption is false. Using SOMtime, a topology-preserving representation method based on high-capacity Self-Organizing Maps, we demonstrate that sensitive attributes such as age and income emerge as dominant latent axes in purely unsupervised embeddings, even when explicitly excluded from the input. On two large-scale real-world datasets (the World Values Survey across five countries and the Census-Income dataset), SOMtime recovers monotonic orderings aligned with withheld sensitive attributes, achieving Spearman correlations of up to 0.85, whereas PCA and UMAP typically remain below 0.23 (with a single exception reaching 0.31), and against t-SNE and autoencoders which achieve at most 0.34. Furthermore, unsupervised segmentation of SOMtime embeddings produces demographically skewed clusters, demonstrating downstream fairness risks without any supervised task. These findings establish that \textit{fairness through unawareness} fails at the representation level for ordinal sensitive attributes and that fairness auditing must extend to unsupervised components of machine learning pipelines. We have made the code available at~ https://github.com/JosephBingham/SOMtime

Conclusion: OMAD框架能够有效提高在线MARL的性能和样本效率

Abstract: Online Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a prominent framework for efficient agent coordination. Crucially, enhancing policy expressiveness is pivotal for achieving superior performance. Diffusion-based generative models are well-positioned to meet this demand, having demonstrated remarkable expressiveness and multimodal representation in image generation and offline settings. Yet, their potential in online MARL remains largely under-explored. A major obstacle is that the intractable likelihoods of diffusion models impede entropy-based exploration and coordination. To tackle this challenge, we propose among the first \underline{O}nline off-policy \underline{MA}RL framework using \underline{D}iffusion policies (\textbf{OMAD}) to orchestrate coordination. Our key innovation is a relaxed policy objective that maximizes scaled joint entropy, facilitating effective exploration without relying on tractable likelihood. Complementing this, within the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, we employ a joint distributional value function to optimize decentralized diffusion policies. It leverages tractable entropy-augmented targets to guide the simultaneous updates of diffusion policies, thereby ensuring stable coordination. Extensive evaluations on MPE and MAMuJoCo establish our method as the new state-of-the-art across $10$ diverse tasks, demonstrating a remarkable $2.5\times$ to $5\times$ improvement in sample efficiency.

Abstract: We consider the landscape of empirical risk minimization for high-dimensional Gaussian single-index models (generalized linear models). The objective is to recover an unknown signal $\boldsymbolθ^\star \in \mathbb{R}^d$ (where $d \gg 1$) from a loss function $\hat{R}(\boldsymbolθ)$ that depends on pairs of labels $(\mathbf{x}_i \cdot \boldsymbolθ, \mathbf{x}_i \cdot \boldsymbolθ^\star)_{i=1}^n$, with $\mathbf{x}_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I_d)$, in the proportional asymptotic regime $n \asymp d$. Using the Kac-Rice formula, we analyze different complexities of the landscape -- defined as the expected number of critical points -- corresponding to various types of critical points, including local minima. We first show that some variational formulas previously established in the literature for these complexities can be drastically simplified, reducing to explicit variational problems over a finite number of scalar parameters that we can efficiently solve numerically. Our framework also provides detailed predictions for properties of the critical points, including the spectral properties of the Hessian and the joint distribution of labels. We apply our analysis to the real phase retrieval problem for which we derive complete topological phase diagrams of the loss landscape, characterizing notably BBP-type transitions where the Hessian at local minima (as predicted by the Kac-Rice formula) becomes unstable in the direction of the signal. We test the predictive power of our analysis to characterize gradient flow dynamics, finding excellent agreement with finite-size simulations of local optimization algorithms, and capturing fine-grained details such as the empirical distribution of labels. Overall, our results open new avenues for the asymptotic study of loss landscapes and topological trivialization phenomena in high-dimensional statistical models.

Motivation: 在具有已知扩散系数的多变量随机微分方程中，研究时间齐次漂移函数的估计，从固定时间跨度内的高频观测到的多个轨迹中。

Method: 将漂移估计作为条件去噪问题，并提出了一个条件扩散模型的估计器，该模型能够动态地模拟新的轨迹。

Result: 在不同漂移类别中，所提出的估计器在低维情况下与经典方法相匹配，在更高维度的估计中保持竞争力，且这些增益不能仅归因于架构设计选择。

Abstract: We study the estimation of time-homogeneous drift functions in multivariate stochastic differential equations with known diffusion coefficient, from multiple trajectories observed at high frequency over a fixed time horizon. We formulate drift estimation as a denoising problem conditional on previous observations, and propose an estimator of the drift function which is a by-product of training a conditional diffusion model capable of simulating new trajectories dynamically. Across different drift classes, the proposed estimator was found to match classical methods in low dimensions and remained consistently competitive in higher dimensions, with gains that cannot be attributed to architectural design choices alone.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a cornerstone algorithm for high-dimensional optimization, renowned for its empirical successes. Recent theoretical advances have provided a deep understanding of how SGD enables feature learning in high-dimensional nonlinear models, most notably the \textit{single-index model} with i.i.d. data. In this work, we study the sequential learning problem for single-index models, also known as generalized linear bandits or ridge bandits, where SGD is a simple and natural solution, yet its learning dynamics remain largely unexplored. We show that, similar to the optimal interactive learner, SGD undergoes a distinct ``burn-in'' phase before entering the ``learning'' phase in this setting. Moreover, with an appropriately chosen learning rate schedule, a single SGD procedure simultaneously achieves near-optimal (or best-known) sample complexity and regret guarantees across both phases, for a broad class of link functions. Our results demonstrate that SGD remains highly competitive for learning single-index models under adaptive data.

Abstract: Data collection is a critical component of modern statistical and machine learning pipelines, particularly when data must be gathered from multiple heterogeneous sources to study a target population of interest. In many use cases, such as medical studies or political polling, different sources incur different sampling costs. Observations often have associated group identities (for example, health markers, demographics, or political affiliations) and the relative composition of these groups may differ substantially, both among the source populations and between sources and target population.
  In this work, we study multi-source data collection under a fixed budget, focusing on the estimation of population means and group-conditional means. We show that naive data collection strategies (e.g. attempting to "match" the target distribution) or relying on standard estimators (e.g. sample mean) can be highly suboptimal. Instead, we develop a sampling plan which maximizes the effective sample size: the total sample size divided by $D_{χ^2}(q\mid\mid\overline{p}) + 1$, where $q$ is the target distribution, $\overline{p}$ is the aggregated source distribution, and $D_{χ^2}$ is the $χ^2$-divergence. We pair this sampling plan with a classical post-stratification estimator and upper bound its risk. We provide matching lower bounds, establishing that our approach achieves the budgeted minimax optimal risk. Our techniques also extend to prediction problems when minimizing the excess risk, providing a principled approach to multi-source learning with costly and heterogeneous data sources.

TL;DR: 本研究对 CVaR 在重尾和污染数据下的统计行为进行了深入分析，提出了新的学习理论和方法，为 CVaR 在实际应用中的稳定性和鲁棒性提供了理论支持。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) 是一种广泛用于学习罕见但影响大的损失的风险敏感目标，但其在大尾数据下的统计行为仍然了解不多。

Method: 我们开发了对 CVaR 基于的经验风险最小化在重尾和污染数据下的学习理论分析。我们建立了在最小矩假设下的锐利、高概率泛化和剩余风险界限，涵盖了固定假设、有限和无限类，并扩展到 β-混合相关数据；我们进一步表明这些速率是最小最大最优的。为了捕捉 CVaR 的内在分位数敏感性，我们推导了一个统一的 Bahadur-Kiefer 类型展开，该展开将一个在均值风险 ERM 中缺失的阈值驱动的误差项隔离出来，在重尾体系中是基本的。我们通过提出一个截断中位数均值 CVaR 估计量来补充这些结果，该估计量在对抗性污染下实现了最优速率。

Result: 我们证明了 CVaR 决策本身在重尾下本质上是不稳定的，即使在总体最优解很好地分离的情况下，也建立了一个对决策鲁棒性的基本限制。我们的结果提供了对何时 CVaR 学习泛化和鲁棒，以及由于尾稀缺性不可避免的不稳定性何时发生的原理性描述。

Conclusion: 本研究对 CVaR 在重尾和污染数据下的统计行为进行了深入分析，提出了新的学习理论和方法，为 CVaR 在实际应用中的稳定性和鲁棒性提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is a widely used risk-sensitive objective for learning under rare but high-impact losses, yet its statistical behavior under heavy-tailed data remains poorly understood. Unlike expectation-based risk, CVaR depends on an endogenous, data-dependent quantile, which couples tail averaging with threshold estimation and fundamentally alters both generalization and robustness properties. In this work, we develop a learning-theoretic analysis of CVaR-based empirical risk minimization under heavy-tailed and contaminated data. We establish sharp, high-probability generalization and excess risk bounds under minimal moment assumptions, covering fixed hypotheses, finite and infinite classes, and extending to $β$-mixing dependent data; we further show that these rates are minimax optimal. To capture the intrinsic quantile sensitivity of CVaR, we derive a uniform Bahadur-Kiefer type expansion that isolates a threshold-driven error term absent in mean-risk ERM and essential in heavy-tailed regimes. We complement these results with robustness guarantees by proposing a truncated median-of-means CVaR estimator that achieves optimal rates under adversarial contamination. Finally, we show that CVaR decisions themselves can be intrinsically unstable under heavy tails, establishing a fundamental limitation on decision robustness even when the population optimum is well separated. Together, our results provide a principled characterization of when CVaR learning generalizes and is robust, and when instability is unavoidable due to tail scarcity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对固定预算约束下的最佳手臂识别（BAI）问题，提出了一种灵活高效的算法Box Thirding（B3）。

Method: 算法采用迭代三重比较：每次迭代中比较三个手臂，表现最好的手臂进一步探索，中等的延迟，最差的被丢弃。

Result: B3无需提前知道T，即使在没有T先验知识的情况下，B3也能达到与Successive Halving（SH）相当的最小epsilon最佳手臂误识别概率。在New Yorker卡通标题竞赛数据集上，B3在简单后悔方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: B3是一种有效的算法，可以应用于固定预算约束下的BAI问题，并在New Yorker卡通标题竞赛数据集上优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce Box Thirding (B3), a flexible and efficient algorithm for Best Arm Identification (BAI) under fixed-budget constraints. It is designed for both anytime BAI and scenarios with large N, where the number of arms is too large for exhaustive evaluation within a limited budget T. The algorithm employs an iterative ternary comparison: in each iteration, three arms are compared--the best-performing arm is explored further, the median is deferred for future comparisons, and the weakest is discarded. Even without prior knowledge of T, B3 achieves an epsilon-best arm misidentification probability comparable to Successive Halving (SH), which requires T as a predefined parameter, applied to a randomly selected subset of c0 arms that fit within the budget. Empirical results show that B3 outperforms existing methods under limited-budget constraints in terms of simple regret, as demonstrated on the New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest dataset.
