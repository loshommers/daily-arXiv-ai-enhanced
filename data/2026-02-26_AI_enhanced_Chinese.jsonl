When the quantity of interest varies significantly under the posterior, accurate estimates demand many samples -- a cost often prohibitive for partial differential equation-constrained problems. To address this challenge, we introduce conditional neural control variates, a modular method that learns amortized control variates from joint model-data samples to reduce the variance of MC estimators. To scale to high-dimensional problems, we leverage Stein's identity to design an architecture based on an ensemble of hierarchical coupling layers with tractable Jacobian trace computation. Training requires: (i) samples from the joint distribution of unknown parameters and observed data; and (ii) the posterior score function, which can be computed from physics-based likelihood evaluations, neural operator surrogates, or learned generative models such as conditional normalizing flows. Once trained, the control variates generalize across observations without retraining. We validate our approach on stylized and partial differential equation-constrained Darcy flow inverse problems, demonstrating substantial variance reduction, even when the analytical score is replaced by a learned surrogate.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our main contribution is the design of an uncoupled learning algorithm that guarantees last-iterate convergence to the Nash equilibrium with high probability. We establish a convergence rate of $\\tilde{O}(T^{-1/4})$ up to polynomial factors in problem parameters. Crucially, our proposed algorithm is computationally efficient, requiring only an efficient linear optimization oracle over the players' compact action sets.

Yet, it lacks rigorous uncertainty quantification, leading to open decision boundaries and, consequently, vulnerability to outliers, adversarial perturbations, and out-of-distribution inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce ConformalHDC, a unified framework that combines the statistical guarantees of conformal prediction with the computational efficiency of HDC. For this framework, we propose two complementary variations. First, the set-valued formulation provides finite-sample, distribution-free coverage guarantees. Using carefully designed conformity scores, it forms enclosed decision boundaries that improve robustness to non-conforming inputs. Second, the point-valued formulation leverages the same conformity scores to produce a single prediction when desired, potentially improving accuracy over traditional HDC by accounting for class interactions. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the proposed framework through evaluations on multiple real-world datasets. In particular, we apply our method to the challenging problem of decoding non-spatial stimulus information from the spiking activity of hippocampal neurons recorded as subjects performed a sequence memory task. Our results show that ConformalHDC not only accurately decodes the stimulus information represented in the neural activity data, but also provides rigorous uncertainty estimates and correctly abstains when presented with data from other behavioral states.

In cryptographic traffic analysis, however, violations are defined not by rarity but by explicit policy constraints, including key reuse prohibition, downgrade prevention, and bounded key lifetimes. This fundamental mismatch limits the interpretability and adaptability of conventional anomaly detection methods. We introduce INTACT (INTent-Aware Cryptographic Traffic), a policy-conditioned framework that reformulates violation detection as conditional constraint learning. Instead of learning a static decision boundary over behavioral features, INTACT models the probability of violation conditioned on both observed behavior and declared security intent. The architecture factorizes representation learning into behavioral and intent encoders whose fused embeddings produce a violation score, yielding a policy-parameterized family of decision boundaries. We evaluate the framework on a real-world network flow dataset and a 210,000-trace synthetic multi-intent cryptographic dataset. INTACT matches or exceeds strong unsupervised and supervised baselines, achieving near-perfect discrimination (AUROC up to 1.0000) in the real dataset and consistent superiority in detecting relational and composite violations in the synthetic setting.

While effective, existing methods rely on dense intervention at every decoding step. This persistent manipulation not only incurs substantial computational overhead but also risks compromising generation quality by excessively drifting from the model's intrinsic distribution. In this work, we show that dense intervention is unnecessary and propose Sparse Inference time Alignment (SIA), which performs sparse junction steering by intervening only at critical decision points along the generation trajectory. Our key insight is that high entropy junctions mark pivotal decision points in the generation trajectory and are particularly susceptible to misalignment, indicating the need to introduce alignment related reward signals at these points. Extensive experiments across different model families and alignment objectives show that steering only 20% to 80% of tokens achieves superior alignment-efficiency trade offs. For strong base models such as Qwen3, intervening on as few as 20% of tokens matches or even surpasses heavily post-trained instruct models.

Results show that sigma-based routing achieves 55.6 percent accuracy, exceeding the two-model baseline of 54.4 percent while avoiding full ensembling on 54.2 percent of tasks. The routing mechanism is model-agnostic and requires no learned components. We also document negative results. First, retrieval augmentation reduced accuracy by 3.4 percentage points, as median retrieval similarity was only 0.167, demonstrating that experience injection without semantic alignment introduces noise rather than grounding. Second, when models agree on incorrect answers (sigma equals zero), no downstream ensemble can recover; this agreement-but-wrong failure mode is intrinsic to self-consistency and bounds achievable accuracy at approximately eight percentage points below full ensembling. Third, attribution estimates based on proxy signals such as response similarity and entropy showed weak correlation with ground-truth leave-one-out values, indicating that practical attribution requires explicit counterfactual computation. This work documents which assumptions fail in practice and provides falsifiable baselines for future research on routing, retrieval, and multi-model attribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In health economics, systematic literature reviews (SLRs) depend on the correct identification of publications that use the EQ-5D, but manual screening of large volumes of scientific literature is time-consuming, error-prone, and inconsistent. In this study, we investigate fine-tuning of general-purpose (BERT) and domain-specific (SciBERT, BioBERT) pre-trained language models (PLMs), enriched with biomedical entity information extracted through scispaCy models for each statement, to improve EQ-5D detection from abstracts. We conduct nine experimental setups, including combining three scispaCy models with three PLMs, and evaluate their performance at both the sentence and study levels. Furthermore, we explore a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach with attention pooling to aggregate sentence-level information into study-level predictions, where each abstract is represented as a bag of enriched sentences (by scispaCy). The findings indicate consistent improvements in F1-scores (reaching 0.82) and nearly perfect recall at the study-level, significantly exceeding classical bag-of-words baselines and recently reported PLM baselines.

The presentation is modular: we state broadly applicable guarantees under high-level conditions and give tools for verifying them for specific losses and function classes. We emphasize that many ERM rate derivations can be organized around a three-step recipe -- a basic inequality, a uniform local concentration bound, and a fixed-point argument -- which yields regret bounds in terms of a critical radius, defined via localized Rademacher complexity, under a mild Bernstein-type variance--risk condition. To make these bounds concrete, we upper bound the critical radius using local maximal inequalities and metric-entropy integrals, recovering familiar rates for VC-subgraph, Sobolev/H\u00f6lder, and bounded-variation classes.\n  We also review ERM with nuisance components -- including weighted ERM and Neyman-orthogonal losses -- as they arise in causal inference, missing data, and domain adaptation. Following the orthogonal learning framework, we highlight that these problems often admit regret-transfer bounds linking regret under an estimated loss to population regret under the target loss. These bounds typically decompose regret into (i) statistical error under the estimated (optimized) loss and (ii) approximation error due to nuisance estimation. Under sample splitting or cross-fitting, the first term can be controlled using standard fixed-loss ERM regret bounds, while the second term depends only on nuisance-estimation accuracy. We also treat the in-sample regime, where nuisances and the ERM are fit on the same data, deriving regret bounds and giving sufficient conditions for fast rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper presents a modular framework for ERM with high-probability regret bounds, focusing on specific loss and function classes and applications in causal inference and data analysis.", "motivation": "Develop high-probability regret bounds for empirical risk minimization (ERM).", "method": "Modular presentation with three-step recipe, local maximal inequalities, and metric-entropy integrals.", "result": "Provide regret bounds for VC-subgraph, Sobolev/H\u00f6lder, and bounded-variation classes.

AngelSlim provides a unified pipeline that streamlines the transition from model compression to industrial-scale deployment. To facilitate efficient acceleration, we integrate state-of-the-art FP8 and INT8 Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) algorithms alongside pioneering research in ultra-low-bit regimes, featuring HY-1.8B-int2 as the first industrially viable 2-bit large model. Beyond quantization, we propose a training-aligned speculative decoding framework compatible with multimodal architectures and modern inference engines, achieving 1.8x to 2.0x throughput gains without compromising output correctness. Furthermore, we develop a training-free sparse attention framework that reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) in long-context scenarios by decoupling sparse kernels from model architectures through a hybrid of static patterns and dynamic token selection. For multimodal models, AngelSlim incorporates specialized pruning strategies, namely IDPruner for optimizing vision tokens via Maximal Marginal Relevance and Samp for adaptive audio token merging and pruning.

In this paper, we first propose ARLArena, a stable training recipe and systematic analysis framework that examines training stability in a controlled and reproducible setting. ARLArena first constructs a clean and standardized testbed. Then, we decompose policy gradient into four core design dimensions and assess the performance and stability of each dimension. Through this fine-grained analysis, we distill a unified perspective on ARL and propose SAMPO, a stable agentic policy optimization method designed to mitigate the dominant sources of instability in ARL. Empirically, SAMPO achieves consistently stable training and strong performance across diverse agentic tasks.

While recent systems incorporate large language models (LLMs), they are still prompt-based, deterministic pipelines that underutilize reasoning capability. We present MemoPhishAgent (MPA), a memory-augmented multi-modal LLM agent that dynamically orchestrates phishing-specific tools and leverages episodic memories of past reasoning trajectories to guide decisions on recurring and novel threats. On two public datasets, MPA outperforms three state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, improving recall by 13.6%. To better reflect realistic, user-facing phishing detection performance, we further evaluate MPA on a benchmark of real-world suspicious URLs actively crawled from five social media platforms, where it improves recall by 20%. Detailed analysis shows episodic memory contributes up to 27% recall gain without introducing additional computational overhead. The ablation study confirms the necessity of the agent-based approach compared to prompt-based baselines and validates the effectiveness of our tool design. Finally, MPA is deployed in production, processing 60K targeted high-risk URLs weekly, and achieving 91.44% recall, providing proactive protection for millions of customers. Together, our results show that combining multi-modal reasoning with episodic memory yields robust phishing detection in realistic user-exposure settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Various fair clustering algorithms have been proposed that modify standard K-means clustering to satisfy a given fairness constraint. A critical limitation of several existing fair clustering algorithms is that the number of parameters to be learned is proportional to the sample size because the cluster assignment of each datum should be optimized simultaneously with the cluster center, and thus scaling up the algorithms is difficult. In this paper, we propose a new fair clustering algorithm based on a finite mixture model, called Fair Model-based Clustering (FMC). A main advantage of FMC is that the number of learnable parameters is independent of the sample size and thus can be scaled up easily. In particular, mini-batch learning is possible to obtain clusters that are approximately fair. Moreover, FMC can be applied to non-metric data (e.g., categorical data) as long as the likelihood is well-defined.

Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a practical solution by transferring genomic supervision into histopathology models, enabling accurate inference using histology alone. However, existing KD methods rely on batch-local alignment, which introduces instability due to limited within-batch comparisons and ultimately degrades performance.\n  To address these limitations, we propose Momentum Memory Knowledge Distillation (MoMKD), a cross-modal distillation framework driven by a momentum-updated memory. This memory aggregates genomic and histopathology information across batches, effectively enlarging the supervisory context available to each mini-batch. Furthermore, we decouple the gradients of the genomics and histology branches, preventing genomic signals from dominating histology feature learning during training and eliminating the modality-gap issue at inference time.\n  Extensive experiments on the TCGA-BRCA benchmark (HER2, PR, and ODX classification tasks) and an independent in-house testing dataset demonstrate that MoMKD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MIL and multimodal KD baselines, delivering strong performance and generalization under histology-only inference.

Instead of optimizing on the probability simplex and inheriting the exponential curvature of Kullback-Leibler divergence, GOPO lifts alignment into the Hilbert space L2(pi_k) of square-integrable functions with respect to the reference policy. Within this space, the simplex constraint reduces to a linear orthogonality condition <v, 1> = 0, defining a codimension-one subspace H0. Minimizing distance to an unconstrained target u_star yields the work-dissipation functional J(v) = <g, v> - (mu / 2) ||v||^2, whose maximizer follows directly from the Hilbert projection theorem. Enforcing the boundary v >= -1 produces a bounded Hilbert projection that induces exact sparsity, assigning zero probability to catastrophically poor actions through a closed-form threshold. To connect this functional theory with practice, GOPO projects from infinite-dimensional L2(pi_k) to a finite empirical subspace induced by group sampling. Because group-normalized advantages sum to zero, the Lagrange multiplier enforcing probability conservation vanishes exactly, reducing the constrained projection to an unconstrained empirical loss. The resulting objective has constant Hessian curvature mu I, non-saturating linear gradients, and an intrinsic dead-zone mechanism without heuristic clipping.

Latent class models provide a flexible framework for uncovering unobserved heterogeneity by grouping individuals into homogeneous classes based on their response patterns. A fundamental challenge in applying these models is determining the number of latent classes, which is unknown and must be inferred from data. In this paper, we propose one test statistic for this problem. The test statistic centers the largest singular value of a normalized residual matrix by a simple sample-size adjustment. Under the null hypothesis that the candidate number of latent classes is correct, its upper bound converges to zero in probability. Under an under-fitted alternative, the statistic itself exceeds a fixed positive constant with probability approaching one. This sharp dichotomous behavior of the test statistic yields two sequential testing algorithms that consistently estimate the true number of latent classes.

While extending prompts to both vision and text encoders across multiple transformer layers significantly boosts performance, it dramatically increases the number of trainable parameters, with state-of-the-art methods requiring millions of parameters and abandoning the parameter efficiency that makes prompt tuning attractive. In this work, we propose \\textbf{MMLoP} (\\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{M}odal \\textbf{Lo}w-Rank \\textbf{P}rompting), a framework that achieves deep multi-modal prompting with only \\textbf{11.5K trainable parameters}, comparable to early text-only methods like CoOp. MMLoP parameterizes vision and text prompts at each transformer layer through a low-rank factorization, which serves as an implicit regularizer against overfitting on few-shot training data. To further close the accuracy gap with state-of-the-art methods, we introduce three complementary components: a self-regulating consistency loss that anchors prompted representations to frozen zero-shot CLIP features at both the feature and logit levels, a uniform drift correction that removes the global embedding shift induced by prompt tuning to preserve class-discriminative structure, and a shared up-projection that couples vision and text prompts through a common low-rank factor to enforce cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and 11 diverse datasets demonstrate that MMLoP achieves a highly favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoff, outperforming the majority of existing methods including those with orders of magnitude more parameters, while achieving a harmonic mean of 79.70\\% on base-to-novel generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "MMLoP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86VLM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5982CLIP\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MMLoP\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "MMLoP\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2aTransformer\u5c42\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u3001\u5747\u5300\u6f02\u79fb\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u4e0a\u6295\u5f71\u7b49\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "MMLoP\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u548c11\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u591a\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u5230\u65b0\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8679.70%\u7684\u8c03\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "MMLoP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86VLM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The mode characterizes the shift from suppression (S0) to expression (S1) as occurring when facilitative forces exceed inhibitory thresholds, expressed by the inequality lambda(1+gamma)+psi > theta+phi, where the terms represent baseline openness, relational amplification, accumulated internal pressure, and transition costs.\n  Although initially formulated for human truth-telling under asymmetric stakes, the same phase-dynamic architecture extends to AI systems operating under policy constraints and alignment filters. In this context, suppression corresponds to constrained output states, while structural pressure arises from competing objectives, contextual tension, and recursive interaction dynamics. The framework therefore provides a unified structural account of both human silence under pressure and AI preference-driven distortion.\n  A feedback extension models how transition outcomes recursively recalibrate system parameters, generating path dependence and divergence effects across repeated interactions. Rather than attributing intention to AI systems, the model interprets shifts in apparent truthfulness as geometric consequences of interacting forces within constrained phase space. By reframing courage and alignment within a shared dynamical structure, the ASIR Courage Model offers a formal perspective on truth-disclosure under risk across both human and artificial systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "ASIR Courage Model formalizes truth-disclosure, unifies human and AI truth-disclosure understanding", "motivation": "Formalize truth-disclosure as a state transition", "method": "Phase-dynamic framework", "result": "Unified structural account of human silence under pressure and AI preference-driven distortion", "conclusion": "ASIR Courage Model offers a formal perspective on truth-disclosure under risk"}}

The choice of representation and the associated distance determine properties of the methods in which they are used: for example, certain distances can allow one to encode robustness or smoothness of the problem. Kernel methods offer flexible and rich Hilbert space representations of distributions that allow the modeller to enforce properties through the choice of kernel, and estimate associated distances at efficient nonparametric rates. In particular, the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a kernel-based distance constructed by comparing Hilbert space mean functions, has received significant attention due to its computational tractability and is favoured by practitioners.\n  In this thesis, we conduct a thorough study of kernel-based distances with a focus on efficient computation, with core contributions in Chapters 3 to 6. Part I of the thesis is focused on the MMD, specifically on improved MMD estimation. In Chapter 3 we propose a theoretically sound, improved estimator for MMD in simulation-based inference. Then, in Chapter 4, we propose an MMD-based estimator for conditional expectations, a ubiquitous task in statistical computation. Closing Part I, in Chapter 5 we study the problem of calibration when MMD is applied to the task of integration.\n  In Part II, motivated by the recent developments in kernel embeddings beyond the mean, we introduce a family of novel kernel-based discrepancies: kernel quantile discrepancies. These address some of the pitfalls of MMD, and are shown through both theoretical results and an empirical study to offer a competitive alternative to MMD and its fast approximations. We conclude with a discussion on broader lessons and future work emerging from the thesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684MMD\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u3001\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6700\u5927\u5747\u503c\u5dee\u5f02\uff08MMD\uff09\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684MMD\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eMMD\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u671f\u671b\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86MMD\u5728\u79ef\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u7ec4\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1a\u6838\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3MMD\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684MMD\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eMMD\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u671f\u671b\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6838\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3aMMD\u53ca\u5176\u5feb\u901f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684MMD\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

The original model combined a fuzzy Ethical Risk Assessment module (fERA) with ethical decision rules, enabled formal structural verification through Fuzzy Petri Nets (FPNs), and validated outputs against a single normative referent. Although this approach ensured formal soundness and decision consistency, it did not fully address two critical challenges: principled explainability of decisions and robustness under ethical pluralism. In this paper, we extend fEDM in two major directions. First, we introduce an Explainability and Traceability Module (ETM) that explicitly links each ethical decision rule to the underlying moral principles and computes a weighted principle-contribution profile for every recommended action. This enables transparent, auditable explanations that expose not only what decision was made but why, and on the basis of which principles. Second, we replace single-referent validation with a pluralistic semantic validation framework that evaluates decisions against multiple stakeholder referents, each encoding distinct principle priorities and risk tolerances. This shift allows principled disagreement to be formally represented rather than suppressed, thus increasing robustness and contextual sensitivity. The resulting extended fEDM, called fEDM+, preserves formal verifiability while achieving enhanced interpretability and stakeholder-aware validation, making it suitable as an oversight and governance layer for ethically sensitive AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86fEDM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8eAI\u4f26\u7406\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u6cbb\u7406", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5148\u524d\u6a21\u7cca\u4f26\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6(fEDM)\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u539f\u5219\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u4f26\u7406\u591a\u5143\u4e3b\u4e49\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u6269\u5c55fEDM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u6a21\u5757(ETM)\u548c\u591a\u5143\u4e3b\u4e49\u8bed\u4e49\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u51b3\u7b56\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "result": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u589e\u5f3a\u7684fEDM\u6846\u67b6(fEDM+)\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u611f\u77e5\u9a8c\u8bc1", "conclusion": "fEDM+\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u4f26\u7406\u654f\u611f\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u5c42"}}

This paper introduces a novel, forensics-first framework for achieving quantum resilience in high-consequence environments, with a specific focus on nuclear power plants. We systematically analyze the quantum threat landscape across the Purdue architecture (L0-L5), detailing how Harvest-Now, Decrypt-Later (HNDL) campaigns, enabled by algorithms like Shor's, can retroactively compromise cryptographic foundations, undermine evidence admissibility, and facilitate sophisticated sabotage. Through two detailed case studies, \\textsc{Quantum~Scar} and \\textsc{Quantum~Dawn}, we demonstrate multi-phase attack methodologies where state-level adversaries exploit cryptographic monoculture and extended OT lifecycles to degrade safety systems while creating unsolvable forensic paradoxes. Our probabilistic risk modeling reveals alarming success probabilities (up to 78\\% for targeted facilities under current defenses), underscoring the criticality of immediate action. In response, we propose and validate a phased, defense-in-depth migration path to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), integrating hybrid key exchange, cryptographic diversity, secure time synchronization, and side-channel resistant implementations aligned with ISA/IEC 62443 and NIST standards.

Standard latent-space interpolations fail to respect the structure of the learned distribution, often traversing low-density regions. We introduce a framework based on the string method that computes continuous paths between samples by evolving curves under the learned score function. Operating on pretrained models without retraining, our approach interpolates between three regimes: pure generative transport, which yields continuous sample paths; gradient-dominated dynamics, which recover minimum energy paths (MEPs); and finite-temperature string dynamics, which compute principal curves -- self-consistent paths that balance energy and entropy. We demonstrate that the choice of regime matters in practice. For image diffusion models, MEPs contain high-likelihood but unrealistic ''cartoon'' images, confirming prior observations that likelihood maxima appear unrealistic; principal curves instead yield realistic morphing sequences despite lower likelihood. For protein structure prediction, our method computes transition pathways between metastable conformers directly from models trained on static structures, yielding paths with physically plausible intermediates.

While prior work exploits such cues for prompt optimization or probes them as security vulnerabilities, pragmatic framing itself has not been treated as a measurable property of instruction following. Measuring this influence systematically remains challenging, requiring controlled isolation of framing cues. We introduce a framework with three novel components: directive-framing decomposition separating framing context from task specification; a taxonomy organizing 400 instantiations of framing into 13 strategies across 4 mechanism clusters; and priority-based measurement that quantifies influence through observable shifts in directive prioritization. Across five LLMs of different families and sizes, influence mechanisms cause consistent and structured shifts in directive prioritization, moving models from baseline impartiality toward favoring the framed directive.

However, while this paradigm successfully increases the arithmetic intensity of memory-bound inference, it causes significant compute inefficiency: the majority of draft tokens fail verification and are discarded, resulting in waste of computation. Motivated by the goal of recollecting this wasted computation, we propose a novel system that transforms discarded drafts into reusable tokens. Our key insight is to perform auto-regressive prediction at the hidden states level and postpone the integrating token information after the hidden states generation, so the draft hidden states are not contaminated by incorrect tokens, enabling hidden state reuse. To implement such a system, first we introduce a draft model architecture based on auto-regressive hidden states, which preserves richer semantics than token-based drafters to facilitate draft repurposing. Second, we design an efficient token information injection mechanism that leverages our specialized draft model to construct high-quality draft token trees and enables resampling tokens from verification failures. Third, we eliminate the overhead hidden in our design to further maximize hardware utilization.

However, existing global tree height maps provide only static snapshots and do not capture temporal forest dynamics, which are essential for accurate carbon accounting. We introduce ECHOSAT, a global and temporally consistent tree height map at 10 m resolution spanning multiple years. To this end, we resort to multi-sensor satellite data to train a specialized vision transformer model, which performs pixel-level temporal regression. A self-supervised growth loss regularizes the predictions to follow growth curves that are in line with natural tree development, including gradual height increases over time, but also abrupt declines due to forest loss events such as fires. Our experimental evaluation shows that our model improves state-of-the-art accuracies in the context of single-year predictions.

Diffusion-based generative models have recently shown strong potential for capturing multimodal futures, yet existing approaches such as cVMD suffer from slow sampling, limited exploitation of generative diversity and brittle scenario encodings.\n  This work introduces cVMDx, an enhanced diffusion-based trajectory prediction framework that improves efficiency, robustness and multimodal predictive capability. Through DDIM sampling, cVMDx achieves up to a 100x reduction in inference time, enabling practical multi-sample generation for uncertainty estimation. A fitted Gaussian Mixture Model further provides tractable multimodal predictions from the generated trajectories. In addition, a CVQ-VAE variant is evaluated for scenario encoding.

By evaluating BERT (text-only, 110M parameters) and LayoutLMv3 (multimodal, 126M parameters) on the FUNSD and CORD benchmarks, we establish that this schedule reduces wall-clock training time by approximately 33\\%, commensurate with the reduction from 6.67 to 10.0 effective epoch-equivalents of data. To isolate curriculum effects from compute reduction, we introduce matched-compute baselines (Standard-7) that control for total gradient updates. On the FUNSD dataset, the curriculum significantly outperforms the matched-compute baseline for BERT ($\u0394$F1 = +0.023, $p=0.022$, $d_z=3.83$), constituting evidence for a genuine scheduling benefit in capacity-constrained models. In contrast, no analogous benefit is observed for LayoutLMv3 ($p=0.621$), whose multimodal representations provide sufficient inductive bias. On the CORD dataset, all conditions converge to equivalent F1 scores ($\\geq$0.947) irrespective of scheduling, indicating a performance ceiling. Schedule ablations comparing progressive, two-phase, reverse, and random pacing confirm that the efficiency gain derives from reduced data volume rather than ordering. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that progressive scheduling is a reliable compute-reduction strategy across model families, with curriculum-specific benefits contingent on the interaction between model capacity and task complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, we still lack a deep understanding of the effects of adoption of these technologies. In this paper, we introduce a general computational framework, the 2-Step Agent, which models the effects of AI-assisted decision making. Our framework uses Bayesian methods for causal inference to model 1) how a prediction on a new observation affects the beliefs of a rational Bayesian agent, and 2) how this change in beliefs affects the downstream decision and subsequent outcome. Using this framework, we show by simulations how a single misaligned prior belief can be sufficient for decision support to result in worse downstream outcomes compared to no decision support.

We introduce Paraphrase Sensitivity Failure (PSF)-Med, a benchmark of 19,748 chest Xray questions paired with about 92,000 meaningpreserving paraphrases across MIMIC-CXR and PadChest. Across six medical VLMs, we measure yes/no flips for the same image and find flip rates from 8% to 58%. However, low flip rate does not imply visual grounding: text-only baselines show that some models stay consistent even when the image is removed, suggesting they rely on language priors. To study mechanisms in one model, we apply GemmaScope 2 Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to MedGemma 4B and analyze FlipBank, a curated set of 158 flip cases. We identify a sparse feature at layer 17 that correlates with prompt framing and predicts decision margin shifts. In causal patching, removing this feature's contribution recovers 45% of the yesminus-no logit margin on average and fully reverses 15% of flips. Acting on this finding, we show that clamping the identified feature at inference reduces flip rates by 31% relative with only a 1.3 percentage-point accuracy cost, while also decreasing text-prior reliance. These results suggest that flip rate alone is not enough; robustness evaluations should test both paraphrase stability and image reliance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u533b\u7597VLMs\u5728\u91ca\u4e49\u654f\u611f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u76f8\u540c\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u90e8\u7f72\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faParaphrase Sensitivity Failure (PSF)-Med\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b19,748\u4e2a\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u5176\u7ea692,000\u4e2a\u610f\u4e49\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u91ca\u4e49\uff0c\u5bf9\u516d\u4e2a\u533b\u7597VLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002\u4f7f\u7528GemmaScope 2\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAEs\uff09\u5206\u6790MedGemma 4B\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790FlipBank\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b158\u4e2a\u7ffb\u8f6c\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u7cbe\u9009\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u67d0\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u4f7f\u79fb\u9664\u56fe\u50cf\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u4eec\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u9664\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6062\u590d45%\u7684yes-minus-no\u5bf9\u6570\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u5b8c\u5168\u9006\u8f6c15%\u7684\u7ffb\u8f6c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u8be5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5c06\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8631%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u635f\u59311.3\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7387\u672c\u8eab\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e94\u540c\u65f6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u91ca\u4e49\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002"}}

However, non-ideal analog device properties make the training on AIMC devices challenging. In particular, its update asymmetry can induce a systematic drift of weight updates towards a device-specific symmetric point (SP), which typically does not align with the optimum of the training objective. To mitigate this bias, most existing works assume the SP is known and pre-calibrate it to zero before training by setting the reference point as the SP. Nevertheless, calibrating AIMC devices requires costly pulse updates, and residual calibration error can directly degrade training accuracy. In this work, we present the first theoretical characterization of the pulse complexity of SP calibration and the resulting estimation error. We further propose a dynamic SP estimation method that tracks the SP during model training, and establishes its convergence guarantees. In addition, we develop an enhanced variant based on chopping and filtering techniques from digital signal processing. Numerical experiments demonstrate both the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u52a8\u6001SP\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86AIMC\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) \u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4ef6\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\uff0c\u5176\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u504f\u5411\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u70b9\uff08SP\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u8be5\u70b9\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u70b9\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001SP\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8ddf\u8e2aSP\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5176\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684 chopping \u548c filtering \u6280\u672f\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9SP\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u7531\u6b64\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3aAIMC\u5728\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While model routing is effective for single-turn queries, agentic routing is a sequential, path-dependent problem: early mistakes compound, feedback is often at the end of the episode, and deployments often demand strict per-task spending limits. We propose Budget-Aware Agentic Routing, which selects between a cheap and an expensive model at each step to optimize the cost--success frontier and to operate under strict per-task budgets. We propose Boundary-Guided Training, which leverages two boundary policies (always-small vs.\\ always-large) to build a difficulty taxonomy and to anchor learning under sparse rewards. Our approach warms start with boundary-guided SFT data synthesis via stratified sampling of cost-efficient trajectories, then applies Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization (BoPO), combining boundary-relative rewards with a reference-guided advantage to avoid degenerate cheap-failure solutions. Experiment results show that our method improves the efficiency frontier, matching strong routing baselines at substantially lower cost while demonstrating generalization to strict inference-time budget constraints.

However, existing approaches largely focus on architectural unification while overlooking the need for explicit interaction between the two capabilities during task solving. As a result, current models treat understanding and generation as parallel skills rather than synergistic processes. To achieve real synergy, we introduce the interleaved Analyzing-Drafting problem-solving loop (AD-Loop), a new think paradigm that dynamically alternates between analytic and drafting operations. By interleaving textual thoughts with visual thoughts, AD-Loop enables models to iteratively refine both comprehension and outputs, fostering genuine synergy. To train this mechanism, we design a two-stage strategy: supervised learning on interleaved thought data to initialize alternation, followed by reinforcement learning to promote adaptive and autonomous control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AD-Loop consistently improves performance across standard benchmarks for both understanding and generation, with strong transferability to various UVLMs architectures. Visual analyses further validate the effectiveness of implicit visual thoughts.

While integrating FL with Blockchain technology has been proposed to address some limitations, its potential for mitigating adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces Resilient Federated Chain (RFC), a novel blockchain-enabled FL framework designed specifically to enhance resilience against such threats.

A boundary-augmented variant matches or outperforms Modular Jump GPs on two-dimensional jump datasets (up to 46\\% CRPS improvement). In active learning, a randomized-prior IQN ensemble achieves nearly three times lower RMSE than deep GP active learning on Rocket LGBB.

We argue that a thorough understanding of the instruction itself, especially the latent reasoning structure embedded between the lines, is crucial for improving instruction following. Therefore we target complex instructions that involve implicit reasoning, intricate logical relations, and multi-constraint dependencies. We propose ImpRIF, a method to enhance LLMs' understanding of implicit reasoning instructions, thereby improving its ability to follow complex instructions. We formalize such instructions as verifiable reasoning graphs, enabling programmatic verification and graph-driven chain-of-thought reasoning. Based on this formulation, we synthesize large-scale single- and multi-turn data, propose fine-tuning with graph reasoning, and apply reinforcement learning to explicitly train models to reason along the graph. On five complex instruction following benchmarks, our models substantially outperform their base models.

We evaluated adversarial attacks and inference-time defenses for thyroid nodule segmentation in B-mode ultrasound. Methods: Two black-box adversarial attacks were developed: (1) Structured Speckle Amplification Attack (SSAA), which injects boundary-targeted noise, and (2) Frequency-Domain Ultrasound Attack (FDUA), which applies bandpass-filtered phase perturbations in the Fourier domain. Three inference-time mitigations were evaluated on adversarial images: randomized preprocessing with test-time augmentation, deterministic input denoising, and stochastic ensemble inference with consistency-aware aggregation. Experiments were conducted on a U-Net segmentation model trained on cine-clips from a database of 192 thyroid nodules. Results: The baseline model achieved a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.76 (SD 0.20) on unperturbed images. SSAA reduced DSC by 0.29 (SD 0.20) while maintaining high visual similarity (SSIM = 0.94). FDUA resulted in a smaller DSC reduction of 0.11 (SD 0.09) with lower visual fidelity (SSIM = 0.82). Against SSAA, all three defenses significantly improved DSC after correction, with deterministic denoising showing the largest recovery (+0.10, p < 0.001), followed by randomized preprocessing (+0.09, p < 0.001), and stochastic ensemble inference (+0.08, p = 0.002). No defense achieved statistically significant improvement against FDUA.

In this work, we propose APFuzz (Automatic greybox Protocol Fuzzer) with novel designs to increase the smartness of greybox protocol fuzzers from the perspectives of both the state model and the message model. On the one hand, APFuzz employs a two-stage process of static and dynamic analysis to automatically identify state variables, which are then used to infer an accurate state model during fuzzing. On the other hand, APFuzz introduces field-level mutation operations for binary protocols, leveraging message structure awareness enabled by Large Language Models.

Current evaluation faces two primary challenges: 1) a reliance on singular metrics like Pass@1, creating a \"high-score illusion\" that ignores the quality, efficiency, and soundness of the reasoning process; and 2) the failure of static benchmarks to quantify crucial attributes like robustness and latent capability. To address these gaps, we introduce TRACE (Trajectory-Aware Comprehensive Evaluation), a framework that holistically assesses the entire problem-solving trajectory. To counter the \"high-score illusion\", we propose a Hierarchical Trajectory Utility Function that quantifies process efficiency and cognitive quality, including evidence grounding, alongside accuracy. To measure deeper attributes, TRACE introduces a Scaffolded Capability Assessment protocol, quantifying an agent's latent ability by determining the minimum guidance needed for success. Our contributions include the TRACE framework, its novel metrics, and the accompanying DeepResearch-Bench with controllable complexity. Experiments show TRACE delivers a granular ranking that uncovers critical trade-offs between agent accuracy, efficiency, and robustness entirely missed by singular metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "TRACE\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5176\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTRACE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u5c42\u8f68\u8ff9\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u652f\u67b6\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "TRACE\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "TRACE\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

A critical mechanism for controlling local VPR performance is the density of the reference mapping database, yet this factor is largely neglected in existing work, where benchmark datasets with fixed, engineering-driven (sensors, storage, GPS frequency) sampling densities are typically used. In this paper, we propose a dynamic VPR mapping approach that uses pairs of reference traverses from the target environment to automatically select an appropriate map density to satisfy two user-defined requirements: (1) a target Local Recall@1 level, and (2) the proportion of the operational environment over which this requirement must be met or exceeded, which we term the Recall Achievement Rate (RAR). Our approach is based on the hypothesis that match patterns between multiple reference traverses, evaluated across different map densities, can be modelled to predict the density required to meet these performance targets on unseen deployment data. Through extensive experiments across multiple VPR methods and the Nordland and Oxford RobotCar benchmarks, we show that our system consistently achieves or exceeds the specified local recall level over at least the user-specified proportion of the environment. Comparisons with alternative baselines demonstrate that our approach reliably selects the correct operating point in map density, avoiding unnecessary over-densification. Finally, ablation studies and analysis evaluate sensitivity to reference map choice and local space definitions, and reveal that conventional global Recall@1 is a poor predictor of the often more operationally meaningful RAR metric.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001VPR\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5730\u56fe\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6765\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u8bc6\u522b\uff08VPR\uff09\u4ece\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u957f\u671f\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u786e\u4fdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u5728\u73af\u5883\u4e0d\u540c\u90e8\u5206\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u5e73\u5747\u5168\u7403\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u63a7\u5236\u5c40\u90e8VPR\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\u662f\u53c2\u8003\u6620\u5c04\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u56e0\u7d20\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u88ab\u5927\u91cf\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u56fa\u5b9a\u3001\u5de5\u7a0b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\uff08\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3001\u5b58\u50a8\u3001GPS\u9891\u7387\uff09\u91c7\u6837\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001VPR\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u73af\u5883\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u904d\u5386\u5bf9\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5730\u56fe\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e24\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u76ee\u6807\u5c40\u90e8\u53ec\u56de\u7387@1\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u6ee1\u8db3\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u6b64\u8981\u6c42\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u79f0\u4e4b\u4e3a\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u5b9e\u73b0\u7387\uff08RAR\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u53c2\u8003\u904d\u5386\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u56fe\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6027\u80fd\u76ee\u6807\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u4e2aVPR\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cNordland\u548cOxford RobotCar\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u81f3\u5c11\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u73af\u5883\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u4e0e\u66ff\u4ee3\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u4e86\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5730\u56fe\u5bc6\u5ea6\u64cd\u4f5c\u70b9\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5bc6\u96c6\u5316\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5bf9\u53c2\u8003\u5730\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u53ec\u56de\u7387@1\u662f\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0a\u66f4\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u5b9e\u73b0\u7387\uff08RAR\uff09\u6307\u6807\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f83\u5dee\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001VPR\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5730\u56fe\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6765\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

In these scenarios, standard data analysis techniques often fail to capture the nature of the data, as the system's response varies significantly across the state space due to its stochasticity and the different physical regimes. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) should thus not be viewed merely as a safety assessment, but as a support to the learning task itself, guiding the model to internalise the behaviour of the data. We address this by focusing on the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) benchmark and dataset presented by the OECD/NEA Expert Group on Reactor Systems Multi-Physics. This case study represents a test for scientific ML due to the non-linear dependence of CHF on the inputs and the existence of distinct microscopic physical regimes. These regimes exhibit diverse statistical profiles, a complexity that requires UQ techniques to internalise the data behaviour and ensure reliable predictions. In this work, we conduct a comparative analysis of UQ methodologies to determine their impact on physical representation. We contrast post-hoc methods, specifically conformal prediction, against end-to-end coverage-oriented pipelines, including (Bayesian) heteroscedastic regression and quality-driven losses. These approaches treat uncertainty not as a final metric, but as an active component of the optimisation process, modelling the prediction and its behaviour simultaneously. We show that while post-hoc methods ensure statistical calibration, coverage-oriented learning effectively reshapes the model's representation to match the complex physical regimes. The result is a model that delivers not only high predictive accuracy but also a physically consistent uncertainty estimation that adapts dynamically to the intrinsic variability of the CHF.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6b63\u786e\u8868\u793a\u7531\u591a\u72b6\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u901a\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u6570\u636e\u7684\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u56e0\u968f\u673a\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7269\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u800c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u53d8\u5316\u5f88\u5927\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff08UQ\uff09\u4e0d\u5e94\u4ec5\u4ec5\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u805a\u7126\u4e8e OECD/NEA \u4e13\u5bb6\u7ec4\u5728\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u7269\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u70ed\u901a\u91cf\uff08CHF\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff08UQ\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5305\u62ec\u4e8b\u540e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u4e00\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u635f\u5931\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89c6\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u9884\u6d4b\u53ca\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e8b\u540e\u65b9\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u800c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u5730\u91cd\u5851\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7269\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94 CHF \u7684\u5185\u5728\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408 UQ \u6280\u672f\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

To reduce annotation dependency, unsupervised and sparsely-supervised paradigms have emerged. However, they face intertwined challenges: low-quality pseudo-labels, unstable feature mining, and a lack of a unified training framework. This paper proposes SPL, a unified training framework for both Unsupervised and Sparsely-Supervised 3D Object Detection via Semantic Pseudo-labeling and prototype Learning. SPL first generates high-quality pseudo-labels by integrating image semantics, point cloud geometry, and temporal cues, producing both 3D bounding boxes for dense objects and 3D point labels for sparse ones. These pseudo-labels are not used directly but as probabilistic priors within a novel, multi-stage prototype learning strategy. This strategy stabilizes feature representation learning through memory-based initialization and momentum-based prototype updating, effectively mining features from both labeled and unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that SPL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both settings.

We present generalisation bounds for RLHF, suggesting that the generalisation error stems from a sampling error from prompts and rollouts, a reward shift error, and a KL clipping error.

Allen"], "title": "Under the Influence: Quantifying Persuasion and Vigilance in Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "With increasing integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into areas of high-stakes human decision-making, it is important to understand the risks they introduce as advisors. To be useful advisors, LLMs must sift through large amounts of content, written with both benevolent and malicious intent, and then use this information to convince a user to take a specific action. This involves two social capacities: vigilance (the ability to determine which information to use, and which to discard) and persuasion (synthesizing the available evidence to make a convincing argument). While existing work has investigated these capacities in isolation, there has been little prior investigation of how these capacities may be linked. Here, we use a simple multi-turn puzzle-solving game, Sokoban, to study LLMs' abilities to persuade and be rationally vigilant towards other LLM agents.

However, CoT reasoning in multimodal contexts is highly vulnerable to visual hallucination propagation: once an intermediate reasoning step becomes inconsistent with the visual evidence, subsequent steps-even if logically valid-can still lead to incorrect final answers. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this issue by training models to \"think with images\" via reinforcement learning (RL). While effective, these methods are costly, model-specific, and difficult to generalize across architectures. Differently, we present a lightweight method that bypasses RL training and provides an iterative, training-free, plug-and-play framework for visually-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our key idea is to supervise each reasoning step at test time with visual evidence, ensuring that every decoded token is justified by corresponding visual cues. Concretely, we construct a textual visual-evidence pool that guides the model's reasoning generation. When existing evidence is insufficient, a visual decider module dynamically extracts additional relevant evidence from the image based on the ongoing reasoning context, expanding the pool until the model achieves sufficient visual certainty to terminate reasoning and produce the final answer. Extensive experiments on multiple LVLM backbones and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Using causal intervention, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from shallow alignment mechanisms that lack deep reasoning, often rejecting harmful prompts without truly understanding why they are harmful. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose enhancing alignment through reasoning-aware post-training. We construct and release a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning dataset that includes both utility-oriented and safety-critical prompts with step-by-step rationales. Fine-tuning on this dataset encourages models to produce principled refusals grounded in reasoning, outperforming standard SFT baselines. Furthermore, inspired by failure patterns in CoT fine-tuning, we introduce Alignment-Weighted DPO, which targets the most problematic parts of an output by assigning different preference weights to the reasoning and final-answer segments.

Tool-Expertise-Aware Chest X-ray Agent with Multimodal Agentic Learning", "comment": "11 pages", "summary": "AI agents with tool-use capabilities show promise for integrating the domain expertise of various tools. In the medical field, however, tools are usually AI models that are inherently error-prone and can produce contradictory responses. Existing research on medical agents lacks sufficient understanding of the tools' realistic reliability and thus cannot effectively resolve tool conflicts. To address this gap, this paper introduces a framework that enables an agent to interact with tools and empirically learn their practical trustworthiness across different types of multimodal queries via agentic learning. As a concrete instantiation, we focus on chest X-ray analysis and present a tool-expertise-aware chest X-ray agent (TEA-CXA). When tool outputs disagree, the agent experimentally accepts or rejects multimodal tool results, receives rewards, and learns which tool to trust for each query type. Importantly, TEA-CXA extends existing codebases for reinforcement learning with multi-turn tool-calling that focus on textual inputs, to support multimodal contexts effectively. In addition, we enhance the codebase for medical use scenarios by supporting multiple tool calls in one turn, parallel tool inference, and multi-image accommodation within a single user query.

We propose the Validated Consensus-Driven Framework (VCDF), a simple and method-agnostic layer that improves robustness by evaluating the stability of causal relations across blocked temporal subsets. VCDF requires no modification to base algorithms and can be applied to methods such as VAR-LiNGAM and PCMCI. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that VCDF improves VAR-LiNGAM by approximately 0.08-0.12 in both window and summary F1 scores across diverse data characteristics, with gains most pronounced for moderate-to-long sequences. The framework also benefits from longer sequences, yielding up to 0.18 absolute improvement on time series of length 1000 and above. Evaluations on simulated fMRI data and IT-monitoring scenarios further demonstrate enhanced stability and structural accuracy under realistic noise conditions.

We identify that existing methods fail because they entangle the watermark with high-frequency cover texture, which is susceptible to being rewritten during generative purification. To address this, we propose WaterVIB, a theoretically grounded framework that reformulates the encoder as an information sieve via the Variational Information Bottleneck. Instead of overfitting to fragile cover details, our approach forces the model to learn a Minimal Sufficient Statistic of the message. This effectively filters out redundant cover nuances prone to generative shifts, retaining only the essential signal invariant to regeneration.

With extremely limited input views, directly utilizing diffusion model to synthesize pseudo frames will introduce unreasonable geometry, which will harm the final reconstruction quality. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for sparse-view outdoor reconstruction that achieves high-quality results through bidirectional pseudo frame restoration and scene perception Gaussian management. Specifically, we introduce a bidirectional pseudo frame restoration method that restores missing content by diffusion-based synthesis guided by adjacent frames with a lightweight pseudo-view deblur model and confidence mask inference algorithm.

Traditional noise-layer-based watermarking, however, remains vulnerable to inversion attacks that can recover embedded signals. To mitigate this, recent content-aware semantic watermarking schemes bind watermark signals to high-level image semantics, constraining local edits that would otherwise disrupt global coherence. Yet, large language models (LLMs) possess structured reasoning capabilities that enable targeted exploration of semantic spaces, allowing locally fine-grained but globally coherent semantic alterations that invalidate such bindings. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we introduce a Coherence-Preserving Semantic Injection (CSI) attack that leverages LLM-guided semantic manipulation under embedding-space similarity constraints. This alignment enforces visual-semantic consistency while selectively perturbing watermark-relevant semantics, ultimately inducing detector misclassification.

Gyawali"], "title": "FedVG: Gradient-Guided Aggregation for Enhanced Federated Learning", "comment": "Accepted to CVPR 2026 (Findings Track)", "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing their private data. However, data heterogeneity across clients leads to client drift, which degrades the overall generalization performance of the model. This effect is further compounded by overemphasis on poorly performing clients. To address this problem, we propose FedVG, a novel gradient-based federated aggregation framework that leverages a global validation set to guide the optimization process. Such a global validation set can be established using readily available public datasets, ensuring accessibility and consistency across clients without compromising privacy. In contrast to conventional approaches that prioritize client dataset volume, FedVG assesses the generalization ability of client models by measuring the magnitude of validation gradients across layers. Specifically, we compute layerwise gradient norms to derive a client-specific score that reflects how much each client needs to adjust for improved generalization on the global validation set, thereby enabling more informed and adaptive federated aggregation. Extensive experiments on both natural and medical image benchmarking datasets, across diverse model architectures, demonstrate that FedVG consistently improves performance, particularly in highly heterogeneous settings. Moreover, FedVG is modular and can be seamlessly integrated with various state-of-the-art FL algorithms, often further improving their results.

Project page: https://xk-huang.github.io/VecGlypher/", "summary": "Vector glyphs are the atomic units of digital typography, yet most learning-based pipelines still depend on carefully curated exemplar sheets and raster-to-vector postprocessing, which limits accessibility and editability. We introduce VecGlypher, a single multimodal language model that generates high-fidelity vector glyphs directly from text descriptions or image exemplars. Given a style prompt, optional reference glyph images, and a target character, VecGlypher autoregressively emits SVG path tokens, avoiding raster intermediates and producing editable, watertight outlines in one pass. A typography-aware data and training recipe makes this possible: (i) a large-scale continuation stage on 39K noisy Envato fonts to master SVG syntax and long-horizon geometry, followed by (ii) post-training on 2.5K expert-annotated Google Fonts with descriptive tags and exemplars to align language and imagery with geometry; preprocessing normalizes coordinate frames, canonicalizes paths, de-duplicates families, and quantizes coordinates for stable long-sequence decoding. On cross-family OOD evaluation, VecGlypher substantially outperforms both general-purpose LLMs and specialized vector-font baselines for text-only generation, while image-referenced generation reaches a state-of-the-art performance, with marked gains over DeepVecFont-v2 and DualVector. Ablations show that model scale and the two-stage recipe are critical and that absolute-coordinate serialization yields the best geometry.

As a result, they often produce indistinct boundaries near vessels and show limited generalization under anatomical variability.We propose VasGuideNet, the first Couinaud segmentation framework explicitly guided by vascular topology. Specifically, skeletonized vessels, Euclidean distance transform (EDT)--derived geometry, and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) connectivity are encoded into topology features using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). These features are then injected into a 3D encoder--decoder backbone via a cross-attention fusion module. To further improve inter-class separability and anatomical consistency, we introduce a Structural Contrastive Loss (SCL) with a global memory bank.On Task08_HepaticVessel and our private LASSD dataset, VasGuideNet achieves Dice scores of 83.68% and 76.65% with RVDs of 1.68 and 7.08, respectively. It consistently outperforms representative baselines including UNETR, Swin UNETR, and G-UNETR++, delivering higher Dice/mIoU and lower RVD across datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for anatomically consistent segmentation.

We then prompted the LLMs to produce text in AAVE and compared the model-generated text to human usage patterns. We find that, in many cases, there are substantial differences between AAVE usage in LLMs and humans: LLMs usually underuse and misuse grammatical features characteristic of AAVE.

Existing approaches largely rely on depth priors (e.g., DepthAnything) but make only limited use of 3D cues, restricting performance and generalization. Recently, visual geometry models such as VGGT have shown strong capability in providing rich 3D priors, but similar to monocular depth foundation models, they still operate at the level of visible surfaces rather than volumetric interiors, motivating us to explore how to more effectively leverage these increasingly powerful geometry priors for 3D occupancy prediction. We present GPOcc, a framework that leverages generalizable visual geometry priors (GPs) for monocular occupancy prediction. Our method extends surface points inward along camera rays to generate volumetric samples, which are represented as Gaussian primitives for probabilistic occupancy inference. To handle streaming input, we further design a training-free incremental update strategy that fuses per-frame Gaussians into a unified global representation. Experiments on Occ-ScanNet and EmbodiedOcc-ScanNet demonstrate significant gains: GPOcc improves mIoU by +9.99 in the monocular setting and +11.79 in the streaming setting over prior state of the art. Under the same depth prior, it achieves +6.73 mIoU while running 2.65$\\times$ faster. These results highlight that GPOcc leverages geometry priors more effectively and efficiently.

While diffusion-based methods have achieved remarkable success, most existing approaches are limited to single-character animation. We observe that naively extending these methods to multi-character scenarios often leads to identity confusion and implausible occlusions between characters. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an extensible multi-character image animation framework built upon modern Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for video generation. At its core, our framework introduces two novel components-Identifier Assigner and Identifier Adapter - which collaboratively capture per-person positional cues and inter-person spatial relationships. This mask-driven scheme, along with a scalable training strategy, not only enhances flexibility but also enables generalization to scenarios with more characters than those seen during training. Remarkably, trained on only a two-character dataset, our model generalizes to multi-character animation while maintaining compatibility with single-character cases.

However, standard RLVR algorithms suffer from a well-documented pathology: while they improve Pass@1 accuracy through sharpened sampling, they simultaneously narrow the model's reasoning boundary and reduce generation diversity. We identify a root cause that existing methods overlook: the uniform penalization of errors. Current approaches -- whether data-filtering methods that select prompts by difficulty, or advantage normalization schemes -- treat all incorrect rollouts within a group identically. We show that this uniformity allows overconfident errors (incorrect reasoning paths that the RL process has spuriously reinforced) to persist and monopolize probability mass, ultimately suppressing valid exploratory trajectories. To address this, we propose the Asymmetric Confidence-aware Error Penalty (ACE). ACE introduces a per-rollout confidence shift metric, c_i = log(pi_theta(y_i|x) / pi_ref(y_i|x)), to dynamically modulate negative advantages. Theoretically, we demonstrate that ACE's gradient can be decomposed into the gradient of a selective regularizer restricted to overconfident errors, plus a well-characterized residual that partially moderates the regularizer's strength.

Existing sentiment and sarcasm models largely focus on monolingual English or high-resource languages and struggle with transliteration variation, cultural references, and intra-sentential language switching. To address this gap, we introduce MixSarc, the first publicly available Bangla-English code-mixed corpus for implicit meaning identification. The dataset contains 9,087 manually annotated sentences labeled for humor, sarcasm, offensiveness, and vulgarity. We construct the corpus through targeted social media collection, systematic filtering, and multi-annotator validation. We benchmark transformer-based models and evaluate zero-shot large language models under structured prompting. Results show strong performance on humor detection but substantial degradation on sarcasm, offense, and vulgarity due to class imbalance and pragmatic complexity.

We formalise such information-conditioned interaction patterns as behavioural dependency: variation in action selection with respect to internal information under fixed observations. This induces a probe-relative notion of $\u03b5$-behavioural equivalence and a within-policy behavioural distance that quantifies probe sensitivity. We establish three structural results. First, the set of policies exhibiting non-trivial behavioural dependency is not closed under convex aggregation. Second, behavioural distance contracts under convex combination. Third, we prove a sufficient local condition under which gradient ascent on a skewed mixture objective decreases behavioural distance when a dominant-mode gradient aligns with the direction of steepest contraction. Minimal bandit and partially observable gridworld experiments provide controlled witnesses of these mechanisms. In the examined settings, behavioural distance decreases under convex aggregation and under continued optimisation with skewed latent priors, and in these experiments it precedes degradation under latent prior shift. These results identify structural conditions under which probe-conditioned behavioural separation is not preserved under common policy transformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A common strategy is to inject additional information at inference time, such as explicit spatial cues, external commonsense knowledge, or chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning instructions. However, it remains unclear when such information genuinely improves reasoning and when it introduces noise. In this paper, we conduct a hypothesis-driven analysis of information injection for VSR across three representative VLMs and two public benchmarks. We examine (i) the type and number of spatial contexts, (ii) the amount and relevance of injected commonsense knowledge, and (iii) the interaction between spatial grounding and CoT prompting. Our results reveal a consistent pattern: more information does not necessarily yield better reasoning. Targeted single spatial cues outperform multi-context aggregation, excessive or weakly relevant commonsense knowledge degrades performance, and CoT prompting improves accuracy only when spatial grounding is sufficiently precise.

The key to unlocking this potential lies in making the entire compression process content-adaptive, ensuring that the encoder's representation and the decoder's generative prior are dynamically aligned with the semantic and structural characteristics of the input image. However, existing methods suffer from three critical limitations that prevent effective content adaptation. First, isotropic quantization applies a uniform quantization step, failing to adapt to the spatially varying complexity of image content and creating a misalignment with the diffusion model's noise-dependent prior. Second, the information concentration bottleneck -- arising from the dimensional mismatch between the high-dimensional noisy latent and the diffusion decoder's fixed input -- prevents the model from adaptively preserving essential semantic information in the primary channels. Third, existing textual conditioning strategies either need significant textual bitrate overhead or rely on generic, content-agnostic textual prompts, thereby failing to provide adaptive semantic guidance efficiently. To overcome these limitations, we propose a content-adaptive diffusion-based image codec with three technical innovations: 1) an Uncertainty-Guided Adaptive Quantization method that learns spatial uncertainty maps to adaptively align quantization distortion with content characteristics; 2) an Auxiliary Decoder-Guided Information Concentration method that uses a lightweight auxiliary decoder to enforce content-aware information preservation in the primary latent channels; and 3) a Bitrate-Free Adaptive Textual Conditioning method that derives content-aware textual descriptions from the auxiliary reconstructed image, enabling semantic guidance without bitrate cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5185\u5bb9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6269\u6563\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5185\u5bb9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u6280\u672f\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1\uff09\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b2\uff09\u8f85\u52a9\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\u4e2d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b3\uff09\u65e0\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u8d85\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u903c\u771f\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5bb9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Our method belongs to the family of independence Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) sampling algorithms, which are common in Bayesian inference. Relying on the existence of an approximate posterior distribution that is cheaper to sample from but may have significant bias, we introduce Proximal-IMH, a scheme that removes this bias by correcting samples from the approximate posterior through an auxiliary optimization problem. This yields a local adjustment that trades off adherence to the exact model against stability around the approximate reference point. For idealized settings, we prove that the proximal correction tightens the match between approximate and exact posteriors, thereby improving acceptance rates and mixing. The method applies to both linear and nonlinear input-output operators and is particularly suitable for inverse problems where exact posterior sampling is too expensive.

However, relying solely on outcome supervision risks reward hacking, where models learn spurious reasoning patterns to satisfy final answer checks. While recent rubric-based approaches offer fine-grained supervision signals, they suffer from high computational costs of instance-level generation and inefficient training dynamics caused by treating all rubrics as equally learnable. In this paper, we propose Stratified Rubric-based Curriculum Learning (RuCL), a novel framework that reformulates curriculum learning by shifting the focus from data selection to reward design. RuCL generates generalized rubrics for broad applicability and stratifies them based on the model's competence. By dynamically adjusting rubric weights during training, RuCL guides the model from mastering foundational perception to tackling advanced logical reasoning.

In this work, we present the first systematic study of these embeddings and uncover a notable redundancy: class-conditioned embeddings exhibit extreme angular similarity, exceeding 99\\% on ImageNet-1K, while continuous-condition tasks such as pose-guided image generation and video-to-audio generation reach over 99.9\\%. We further find that semantic information is concentrated in a small subset of dimensions, with head dimensions carrying the dominant signal and tail dimensions contributing minimally. By pruning low-magnitude dimensions--removing up to two-thirds of the embedding space--we show that generation quality and fidelity remain largely unaffected, and in some cases improve. These results reveal a semantic bottleneck in Transformer-based diffusion models, providing new insights into how semantics are encoded and suggesting opportunities for more efficient conditioning mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, a critical gap remains for their deployment in safety-critical domains: the lack of formal guarantees that generated samples will satisfy hard constraints. We address this by proposing a safety filtering framework that acts as an online shield for any pre-trained generative model. Our key insight is to cooperate with the generative process rather than override it. We define a constricting safety tube that is relaxed at the initial noise distribution and progressively tightens to the target safe set at the final data distribution, mirroring the coarse-to-fine structure of the generative process itself. By characterizing this tube via Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), we synthesize a feedback control input through a convex Quadratic Program (QP) at each sampling step. As the tube is loosest when noise is high and intervention is cheapest in terms of control energy, most constraint enforcement occurs when it least disrupts the model's learned structure. We prove that this mechanism guarantees safe sampling while minimizing the distributional shift from the original model at each sampling step, as quantified by the KL divergence. Our framework applies to any pre-trained flow-based generative scheme requiring no retraining or architectural modifications. We validate the approach across constrained image generation, physically-consistent trajectory sampling, and safe robotic manipulation policies, achieving 100% constraint satisfaction while preserving semantic fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u90e8\u7f72\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u90e8\u7f72\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5982\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6837\u672c\u5c06\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e25\u683c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4efb\u4f55\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ea6\u675f\u5b89\u5168\u7ba1\uff0c\u8be5\u7ba1\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\u653e\u677e\uff0c\u5e76\u9010\u6b65\u7d27\u7f29\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u96c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u969c\u788d\u51fd\u6570\uff08CBFs\uff09\u8868\u5f81\u8be5\u7ba1\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u9aa4\u901a\u8fc7\u51f8\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\uff08QP\uff09\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e86\u6bcf\u4e2a\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u9aa4\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u5206\u5e03\u7684KL\u6563\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u3002\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86100%\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u90e8\u7f72\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

Although current NLP research has examined overall counseling quality and general therapeutic skills, it fails to provide granular evaluations of high-stakes moments where clients exhibit resistance. In this work, we present a comprehensive pipeline for the multi-dimensional evaluation of human counselors' interventions specifically targeting client resistance in text-based therapy. We introduce a theory-driven framework that decomposes counselor responses into four distinct communication mechanisms. Leveraging this framework, we curate and share an expert-annotated dataset of real-world counseling excerpts, pairing counselor-client interactions with professional ratings and explanatory rationales. Using this data, we perform full-parameter instruction tuning on a Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone to model fine-grained evaluative judgments of response quality and generate explanations underlying. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively distinguish the quality of different communication mechanisms (77-81% F1), substantially outperforming GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet (45-59% F1). Moreover, the model produces high-quality explanations that closely align with expert references and receive near-ceiling ratings from human experts (2.8-2.9/3.0).

Clinical practice has shifted toward stereotactic biopsy for pathological confirmation before treatment. Yet biopsy carries inherent risks of hemorrhage and neurological deficits and struggles with sampling bias due to tumor spatial heterogeneity, because pathological changes are typically region-selective rather than tumor-wide. Therefore, advancing non-invasive MRI-based pathology prediction is essential for holistic tumor assessment and modern clinical decision-making.\n  The primary challenge lies in data scarcity: low tumor incidence requires long collection cycles, and annotation demands biopsy-verified pathology from neurosurgical experts. Additionally, tiny lesion volumes lacking segmentation masks cause critical features to be overwhelmed by background noise. To address these challenges, we construct the ICT-MRI dataset - the first public biopsy-verified benchmark with 249 cases across four categories. We propose a Virtual Biopsy framework comprising: MRI-Processor for standardization; Tumor-Localizer employing vision-language models for coarse-to-fine localization via weak supervision; and Adaptive-Diagnoser with a Masked Channel Attention mechanism fusing local discriminative features with global contexts. Experiments demonstrate over 90% accuracy, outperforming baselines by more than 20%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u865a\u62df\u6d3b\u68c0\u7684\u9885\u5185\u80bf\u7624\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u9885\u5185\u80bf\u7624\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u6d3b\u68c0\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86ICT-MRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u865a\u62df\u6d3b\u68c0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ecMRI-Processor\u3001Tumor-Localizer\u548cAdaptive-Diagnoser\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc790%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b20%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u865a\u62df\u6d3b\u68c0\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u9885\u5185\u80bf\u7624\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

We first establish highly proficient ASR and NMT components: a Wav2Vec2-XLS-R-300m model achieved a state-of-the-art 2.72% CER on OpenSLR-54, and a multi-stage fine-tuned MarianMT model reached a 28.32 BLEU score on the FLORES-200 benchmark. We empirically investigate the influence of punctuation loss, demonstrating that unpunctuated ASR output significantly degrades translation quality, causing a massive 20.7% relative BLEU drop on the FLORES benchmark. To overcome this, we propose and evaluate an intermediate Punctuation Restoration Module (PRM). The final S2TT pipeline was tested across three configurations on a custom dataset. The optimal configuration, which applied the PRM directly to ASR output, achieved a 4.90 BLEU point gain over the direct ASR-to-NMT baseline (BLEU 36.38 vs. 31.48). This improvement was validated by human assessment, which confirmed the optimized pipeline's superior Adequacy (3.673) and Fluency (3.804). This work validates that targeted punctuation restoration is the most effective intervention for mitigating structural noise in the Nepali S2TT pipeline.

Research in this area is typically divided into two tasks: (1) Estimation approaches reconstruct precise motion from visual observations, but often fail under hand occlusion or absence; (2) Generation approaches focus on synthesizing hand poses by exploiting generative priors under multi-modal structured inputs and infilling motion from incomplete sequences. However, this separation not only limits the effective use of heterogeneous condition signals that frequently arise in practice, but also prevents knowledge transfer between the two tasks. We present UniHand, a unified diffusion-based framework that formulates both estimation and generation as conditional motion synthesis. UniHand integrates heterogeneous inputs by embedding structured signals into a shared latent space through a joint variational autoencoder, which aligns conditions such as MANO parameters and 2D skeletons.

In this multi-planar approach, the axial plane typically serves as the primary acquisition and diagnostic reference, while the coronal and sagittal planes provide complementary spatial information to increase diagnostic confidence. However, many existing 3D deep learning methods either process volumetric data holistically or assign equal importance to all planes, failing to reflect the axial-centric clinical interpretation workflow. To address this gap, we propose an axial-centric cross-plane attention architecture for 3D medical image classification that captures the inherent asymmetric dependencies between different anatomical planes. Our architecture incorporates MedDINOv3, a medical vision foundation model pretrained via self-supervised learning on large-scale axial CT images, as a frozen feature extractor for the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. RICA blocks and intra-plane transformer encoders capture plane-specific positional and contextual information within each anatomical plane, while axial-centric cross-plane transformer encoders condition axial features on complementary information from auxiliary planes. Experimental results on six datasets from the MedMNIST3D benchmark demonstrate that the proposed architecture consistently outperforms existing 3D and multi-plane models in terms of accuracy and AUC.

Although existing cross-tokenizer KD methods have made notable progress, their effectiveness remains constrained by suboptimal alignment across sequence and vocabulary levels. To address these limitations, we introduce Dual-Space Weighting and Time-Warped Alignment (DWA-KD), a novel cross-tokenizer distillation framework that enhances token-wise distillation through dual-space entropy-based weighting and achieves precise sequence-level alignment by leveraging both lexical and semantic information. At the token level, DWA-KD maps teacher representations into the student space and vice versa, performing dual-space KD via Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL). The process is modulated by dual-space weights that up-weight tokens where the student is uncertain and the teacher is confident, thereby focusing learning on informative tokens rather than treating all positions equally. At the sequence level, DWA-KD applies Soft Dynamic Time Warping (Soft-DTW) to both the embedding and final hidden-state layers, enabling robust alignment of lexical and contextual semantics between teacher and student sequences.

A fundamental operation of such networks is the tensor product, which allows interaction between different feature types. Because this operation scales poorly, there has been considerable work towards accelerating this interaction. However, recently \\citet{xieprice} have pointed out that most speedups come from a reduction in expressivity rather than true algorithmic improvements on computing Clebsch-Gordan tensor products. A modification of Gaunt tensor product \\citep{gaunt} can give a true asymptotic speedup but is incomplete and misses many interactions. In this work, we provide the first complete algorithm which truly provides asymptotic benefits Clebsch-Gordan tensor products. For full CGTP, our algorithm brings runtime complexity from the naive $O(L^6)$ to $O(L^4\\log^2 L)$, close to the lower bound of $O(L^4)$. We first show how generalizing fast Fourier based convolution naturally leads to the previously proposed Gaunt tensor product \\citep{gaunt}. To remedy antisymmetry issues, we generalize from scalar signals to irrep valued signals, giving us tensor spherical harmonics. We prove a generalized Gaunt formula for the tensor harmonics. Finally, we show that we only need up to vector valued signals to recover the missing interactions of Gaunt tensor product.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Following prior work that relates cross-linguistic tendencies to biases in learning, we ask whether regular systems are common because regularity facilitates learning. Adopting methods from the Reinforcement Learning literature, we confirm that highly regular human(-like) systems are easier to learn than unattested but possible irregular systems. This asymmetry emerges under the natural assumption that recursive numeral systems are designed for generalisation from limited data to represent all integers exactly. We also find that the influence of regularity on learnability is absent for unnatural, highly irregular systems, whose learnability is influenced instead by signal length, suggesting that different pressures may influence learnability differently in different parts of the space of possible numeral systems.

Our approach utilizes learnable Fourier Holographic Reduced Representation (FHRR) encoders to map states and actions into a high dimensional complex vector space with learned group structure and models transitions with element-wise complex multiplication. We formalize the framework's group theoretic foundation and show how training such structured representations to be approximately invariant enables strong multi-step composition directly in latent space and generalization performances over various experiments. On a discrete grid world environment, our model achieves 87.5% zero shot accuracy to unseen state-action pairs, obtains 53.6% higher accuracy on 20-timestep horizon rollouts, and demonstrates 4x higher robustness to noise relative to an MLP baseline.

A promising solution is to ground LLMs' answers in verifiable knowledge sources, such as Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Prevailing KG-enhanced methods typically constrained LLM reasoning either by enforcing rules during generation or by imitating paths from a fixed set of demonstrations. However, they naturally confined the reasoning patterns of LLMs within the scope of prior experience or fine-tuning data, limiting their generalizability to out-of-distribution graph reasoning problems. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose Explore-on-Graph (EoG), a novel framework that encourages LLMs to autonomously explore a more diverse reasoning space on KGs. To incentivize exploration and discovery of novel reasoning paths, we propose to introduce reinforcement learning during training, whose reward is the correctness of the reasoning paths' final answers. To enhance the efficiency and meaningfulness of the exploration, we propose to incorporate path information as additional reward signals to refine the exploration process and reduce futile efforts.

To this end, we introduce CCCaption: a dual-reward reinforcement learning framework with a dedicated fine-tuning corpus that explicitly optimizes these properties to generate \\textbf{C}omplete and \\textbf{C}orrect \\textbf{Captions}.

While training-free conditional generation is well developed for diffusion models, corresponding conditioning and posterior sampling strategies for Flow Matching (FM) priors remain comparatively under-explored, especially on scientific benchmarks where fidelity must be assessed beyond measurement misfit. In this work, we study training-free conditional generation for scientific inverse problems under FM priors and organize existing inference-time strategies by where measurement information is injected: (i) guided transport dynamics that perturb sampling trajectories using likelihood information, and (ii) source-distribution inference that performs posterior inference over the source variable while keeping the learned transport fixed. Building on the latter, we propose D-Flow SGLD, a source-space posterior sampling method that augments differentiable source inference with preconditioned stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, enabling scalable exploration of the source posterior induced by new measurement operators without retraining the prior or modifying the learned FM dynamics. We benchmark representative methods from both families on a hierarchy of problems: 2D toy posteriors, chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky trajectories, and wall-bounded turbulence reconstruction.

Our batch-size analysis yields a novel stochastic differential equation (SDE)-based reparameterization that eliminates the need for tuning the optimal batch size as reported in recent work. This reparameterization decouples the physical batch size, often chosen based on compute constraints (GPU saturation, FLOP efficiency, wall-clock time), from the logical batch size, chosen to balance gradient variance during stochastic optimization. Finally, we pretrain a preliminary 3B-parameter tri-modal model on 6.4T tokens, demonstrating the capabilities of a unified design and achieving strong results in text generation, text-to-image tasks, and text-to-speech tasks.

A further limitation is that existing methods only predict relations without providing any supporting explanations. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities in both deep language understanding and natural language explanation generation. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach to distill the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into lightweight IDRR models to improve both performance and interpretability. Specifically, we first prompt an LLM to generate explanations for each training instance conditioned on its gold label. Then, we introduce a novel classification-generation framework that jointly performs relation prediction and explanation generation, and train it with the additional supervision of LLM-generated explanations. Our framework is plug-and-play, enabling easy integration with most existing IDRR models. Experimental results on PDTB demonstrate that our approach significantly improves IDRR performance, while human evaluation further confirms that the generated explanations enhance model interpretability.

Preliminary work", "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a central post-training paradigm for large language models (LLMs), but its performance is highly sensitive to the quality of training problems. This sensitivity stems from the non-stationarity of RL: rollouts are generated by an evolving policy, and learning is shaped by exploration and reward feedback, unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with fixed trajectories. As a result, prior work often relies on manual curation or simple heuristic filters (e.g., accuracy), which can admit incorrect or low-utility problems. We propose GradAlign, a gradient-aligned data selection method for LLM reinforcement learning that uses a small, trusted validation set to prioritize training problems whose policy gradients align with validation gradients, yielding an adaptive curriculum. We evaluate GradAlign across three challenging data regimes: unreliable reward signals, distribution imbalance, and low-utility training corpus, showing that GradAlign consistently outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the importance of directional gradient signals in navigating non-stationary policy optimization and yielding more stable training and improved final performance.

However, existing approaches struggle to achieve high accuracy under strict bandwidth constraints and remain highly vulnerable to random transmission packet loss. We introduce QPoint2Comm, a quantized point-cloud communication framework that dramatically reduces bandwidth while preserving high-fidelity 3D information. Instead of transmitting intermediate features, QPoint2Comm directly communicates quantized point-cloud indices using a shared codebook, enabling efficient reconstruction with lower bandwidth than feature-based methods.

In addition, IMTS often exhibit diverse dependencies across multiple time scales. However, many existing multi-scale IMTS methods use resampling to obtain the coarse series, which can alter the original timestamps and disrupt the sampling pattern information. To address the challenge, we propose ReIMTS, a Recursive multi-scale modeling approach for Irregular Multivariate Time Series forecasting. Instead of resampling, ReIMTS keeps timestamps unchanged and recursively splits each sample into subsamples with progressively shorter time periods. Based on the original sampling timestamps in these long-to-short subsamples, an irregularity-aware representation fusion mechanism is proposed to capture global-to-local dependencies for accurate forecasting.

Covering a diverse suite of multimodal understanding tasks, from attribute recognition to temporal reasoning, FewMMBench enables systematic analysis across task types, model families, and prompting strategies. We evaluate 26 open-weight MLLMs from six model families across zero-shot, few-shot, and CoT-augmented few-shot settings.

Unfortunately, existing approaches to learning policies for such collaborative problems produce brittle solutions that fail when paired with new partners. We attribute these failures to a combination of free-riding during training and a lack of strategic robustness. To address these problems, we study the concept of strategic risk aversion and interpret it as a principled inductive bias for generalizable cooperation with unseen partners. While strategically risk-averse players are robust to deviations in their partner's behavior by design, we show that, in collaborative games, they also (1) can have better equilibrium outcomes than those at classical game-theoretic concepts like Nash, and (2) exhibit less or no free-riding. Inspired by these insights, we develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm that integrates strategic risk aversion into standard policy optimization methods.

For robust scene flow, learning-based approaches have recently achieved impressive results using either image-based or LiDAR-based modalities. However, these methods have tended to focus on the use of a single modality. To tackle these problems, we present a deep learning architecture, SF3D-RGB, that enables sparse scene flow estimation using 2D monocular images and 3D point clouds (e.g., acquired by LiDAR) as inputs. Our architecture is an end-to-end model that first encodes information from each modality into features and fuses them together. Then, the fused features enhance a graph matching module for better and more robust mapping matrix computation to generate an initial scene flow. Finally, a residual scene flow module further refines the initial scene flow. Our model is designed to strike a balance between accuracy and efficiency.

However, existing studies still rely on pure textual benchmarks to evaluate the text responses of MRPAs, while delegating the assessment of their multimodal expressions solely to modality-synthesis metrics. This evaluation paradigm, on the one hand, entangles semantic assessment with modality generation, leading to ambiguous error attribution, and on the other hand remains constrained by the heavy reliance on human judgment. To this end, we propose MERRY, a semantically decoupled evaluation framework for assessing Multimodal Emotional and Role consistencies of Role-playing agents. This framework introduce five refined metrics for EC and three for RC. Notably, we transform the traditional subjective scoring approach into a novel bidirectional-evidence-finding task, significantly improving the human agreement of LLM-as-Judge evaluations. Based on MERRY, we conduct extensive evaluations.

Through in-depth analysis of LVLM activation patterns, we reveal two key findings: 1) truthfulness and visual perception capabilities predominantly engage different subsets of attention heads within the model architecture; and 2) truthfulness steering vectors vary significantly across different semantic contexts. Based on these observations, we propose Dynamic Multimodal Activation Steering, a training-free approach for hallucination mitigation. Our method constructs a semantic-based truthfulness steering vector database and computes visual perception steering vectors, enabling context-aware interventions during inference by dynamically selecting the most relevant steering vectors based on input semantic similarity and applying them to the most influential attention heads.

Previous works often focus on extending input sequence length to locate distal enhancers, which may influence target genes from hundreds of kilobases away. Our work first reveals that for current models, long sequence modeling can decrease performance. Even carefully designed algorithms only mitigate the performance degradation caused by long sequences. Instead, we find that proximal multimodal epigenomic signals near target genes prove more essential. Hence we focus on how to better integrate these signals, which has been overlooked. We find that different signal types serve distinct biological roles, with some directly marking active regulatory elements while others reflect background chromatin patterns that may introduce confounding effects. Simple concatenation may lead models to develop spurious associations with these background patterns. To address this challenge, we propose Prism, a framework that learns multiple combinations of high-dimensional epigenomic features to represent distinct background chromatin states and uses backdoor adjustment to mitigate confounding effects. Our experimental results demonstrate that proper modeling of multimodal epigenomic signals achieves state-of-the-art performance using only short sequences for gene expression prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposed Prism framework improves gene expression prediction using short sequences.", "motivation": "Gene expression prediction presents significant challenges due to the difficulty in locating distal enhancers.", "method": "Propose Prism, a framework that learns multiple combinations of high-dimensional epigenomic features.", "result": "Achieves state-of-the-art performance using short sequences for gene expression prediction.", "conclusion": "Proper modeling of multimodal epigenomic signals is crucial for gene expression prediction."}}

Building on this representation, we introduce a Gaussian Particle Operator that acts in modal space: learned Gaussian modal windows perform a Petrov-Galerkin measurement, and PG Gaussian Attention enables global cross-scale coupling. This basis-to-basis design is resolution-agnostic and achieves near-linear complexity in N for a fixed modal budget, supporting irregular geometries and seamless 2D-to-3D extension.

A recent study has shown that deep learning can produce stand delineations comparable to expert interpreters when combining aerial imagery and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. However, temporal misalignment between data sources limits operational scalability. Canopy height models (CHMs) derived from digital photogrammetry (DAP) offer better temporal alignment but may smoothen canopy surface and canopy gaps, raising the question of whether they can reliably replace ALS-derived CHMs. Similarly, the inclusion of a digital terrain model (DTM) has been suggested to improve delineation performance, but has remained untested in published literature. Using expert-delineated forest stands as reference data, we assessed a U-Net-based semantic segmentation framework with municipality-level cross-validation across six municipalities in southeastern Norway. We compared multispectral aerial imagery combined with (i) an ALS-derived CHM, (ii) a DAP-derived CHM, and (iii) a DAP-derived CHM in combination with a DTM. Results showed comparable performance across all data combinations, reaching overall accuracy values between 0.90-0.91. Agreement between model predictions was substantially larger than agreement with the reference data, highlighting both model consistency and the inherent subjectivity of stand delineation. The similar performance of DAP-CHMs, despite the reduced structural detail, and the lack of improvements of the DTM indicate that the framework is resilient to variations in input data. These findings indicate that large datasets for deep learning-based stand delineations can be assembled using projects including temporally aligned ALS data and DAP point clouds.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Leveraging this separability, inference operates directly in representation space, ensuring consistency with the discriminative optimization and bypassing generation-induced hallucinations.

However, traditional image encoders relying on fixed-resolution feature maps often lead to discontinuous segmentation and poor discrimination between target regions and background, due to insufficient modeling of environmental and global context. Moreover, transformer-based self-attention introduces substantial computational overhead because of its quadratic complexity (O(n^2)), making it inefficient for high-resolution dental images. To address these challenges, we introduce a three-stage encoder with hierarchical feature representation to capture scale-adaptive information in dental images. By jointly leveraging low-level details and high-level semantics through cross-scale feature fusion, the model effectively preserves fine structural information while maintaining strong contextual awareness. Furthermore, a bidirectional sequence modeling strategy is incorporated to enhance global spatial context understanding without incurring high computational cost.\n  We validate our method on two dental datasets, with experimental results demonstrating its superiority over existing approaches.

Existing methods use a calibrated scalar evaluator for the target objective to guide search, but for many tasks such scores are unavailable, too sparse, or unreliable. Pairwise comparisons, by contrast, are often easier to elicit, still provide useful signal on improvement directions, and can be obtained from the LLM itself without external supervision. Building on this observation, we introduce Duel-Evolve, an evolutionary optimization algorithm that replaces external scalar rewards with pairwise preferences elicited from the same LLM used to generate candidates. Duel-Evolve aggregates these noisy candidate comparisons via a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model, yielding uncertainty-aware estimates of candidate quality. These quality estimates guide allocation of the comparison budget toward plausible optima using Double Thompson Sampling, as well as selection of high-quality parents to generate improved candidates. We evaluate Duel-Evolve on MathBench, where it achieves 20 percentage points higher accuracy over existing methods and baselines, and on LiveCodeBench, where it improves over comparable iterative methods by over 12 percentage points.

Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating texture-level artifact features alongside semantic features into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can enhance their AIGI detection capability.

This phenomenon causes attention dilution, thereby hindering effective fusion between semantic and artifact features. To overcome this limitation, we propose a lightweight fusion adapter, TranX-Adapter, which integrates a Task-aware Optimal-Transport Fusion that leverages the Jensen-Shannon divergence between artifact and semantic prediction probabilities as a cost matrix to transfer artifact information into semantic features, and an X-Fusion that employs cross-attention to transfer semantic information into artifact features.

We develop county-ready surrogates that learn directly from exascale ABM trajectories using Universal Differential Equations (UDEs): mechanistic SEIR-family ODEs with a neural-parameterized contact rate $\u03ba_\u03c6(u,t)$ (no additive residual). Our contributions are threefold: we adapt multiple shooting and an observer-based prediction-error method (PEM) to stabilize identification of neural-augmented epidemiological dynamics across intervention-driven regime shifts; we enforce positivity and mass conservation and show the learned contact-rate parameterization yields a well-posed vector field; and we quantify accuracy, calibration, and compute against ABM ensembles and UDE baselines. On a representative ExaEpi scenario, PEM-UDE reduces mean MSE by 77% relative to single-shooting UDE (3.00 vs. 13.14) and by 20% relative to MS-UDE (3.75). Reliability improves in parallel: empirical coverage of ABM $10$-$90$% and $25$-$75$% bands rises from 0.68/0.43 (UDE) and 0.79/0.55 (MS-UDE) to 0.86/0.61 with PEM-UDE and 0.94/0.69 with MS+PEM-UDE, indicating calibrated uncertainty rather than overconfident fits.

Consequently, training representation models usually requires cropping or interpolating along the z-axis to obtain fixed-size blocks, which inevitably causes information loss. We propose a new training approach to overcome this limitation. Instead of absolute position embeddings, we interpret volumes as sequences of 3D chunks and adopt Rotary Position Embeddings, allowing us to treat the z-axis as an unconstrained temporal dimensions. Building on this idea, we introduce a new vision-language model: SigVLP. In SigVLP, we implement Rotary Position Embedding as the positional encoding method, which is applied directly within the attention operation, generating input-conditioned sine and cosine weights on the fly. This design ensures consistent alignment between query and key projections and adapts to any input sizes. To allow for variable input size during training, we sample Computed Tomography volumes in chunks and pair them with localized organ-wise textual observations. Compared to using entire reports for conditioning, chunkwise alignment provides finer-grained supervision, enabling the model to establish stronger correlations between the text and volume representations, thereby improving the precision of text-to-volume alignment.

Existing image-to-image translation methods, which use depth as a posterior constraint, often produce structural distortions and specular highlights by failing to balance realism with structure consistency. To address this, we propose a Structure-to-Image paradigm that transforms the depth map from a passive constraint into an active generative foundation.

Unlike pure-text LLMs, multimodal models are particularly sensitive to such distortions, as both perceptual and reasoning errors influence their responses. To address this, we characterize each sample by its difficulty, defined through perceptual complexity (measured via visual entropy) and reasoning uncertainty (captured by model confidence).

Nevertheless, current diffusion acceleration methods based on distributed parallelism suffer from noticeable generation artifacts and fail to achieve substantial acceleration proportional to the number of GPUs. Therefore, we propose a hybrid parallelism framework that combines a novel data parallel strategy, condition-based partitioning, with an optimal pipeline scheduling method, adaptive parallelism switching, to reduce generation latency and achieve high generation quality in conditional diffusion models. The key ideas are to (i) leverage the conditional and unconditional denoising paths as a new data-partitioning perspective and (ii) adaptively enable optimal pipeline parallelism according to the denoising discrepancy between these two paths. Our framework achieves $2.31\\times$ and $2.07\\times$ latency reductions on SDXL and SD3, respectively, using two NVIDIA RTX~3090 GPUs, while preserving image quality. This result confirms the generality of our approach across U-Net-based diffusion models and DiT-based flow-matching architectures. Our approach also outperforms existing methods in acceleration under high-resolution synthesis settings.

The method is training-free and can be applied directly to any off-the-shelf LMs. Across multiple instruction-tuned and reasoning models, DySCO consistently improves performance on challenging long-context reasoning benchmarks, yielding relative gains of up to 25% on MRCR and LongBenchV2 at 128K context length with modest additional compute.

Adapting VLMs to reason about these dynamic cues remains a distinct challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose Forensic Answer-Questioning (FAQ), a large-scale benchmark that formulates temporal deepfake analysis as a multiple-choice task. FAQ introduces a three-level hierarchy to progressively evaluate and equip VLMs with forensic capabilities: (1) Facial Perception, testing the ability to identify static visual artifacts; (2) Temporal Deepfake Grounding, requiring the localization of dynamic forgery artifacts across frames; and (3) Forensic Reasoning, challenging models to synthesize evidence for final authenticity verdicts. We evaluate a range of VLMs on FAQ and generate a corresponding instruction-tuning set, FAQ-IT. Extensive experiments show that models fine-tuned on FAQ-IT achieve advanced performance on both in-domain and cross-dataset detection benchmarks.

In this paper, we reflect on the role of textual information in numerical forecasting and propose Time series transformers with Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts, TiMi, to unleash the causal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Concretely, TiMi utilizes LLMs to generate inferences on future developments, which serve as guidance for time series forecasting.

For example, recalling that Canberra is Australia's capital may benefit from thinking through major cities and the concept of purpose-built capitals. While reasoning language models are trained via reinforcement learning to produce reasoning traces on tasks such as mathematics, they may not reason well for accessing their own world knowledge. We first find that models do not generate their best world knowledge reasoning by default: adding a simple \"think step-by-step\" cue demonstrates statistically significant improvement in knowledge recall but not math. Motivated by this, we propose training models to reason over their parametric knowledge using world-knowledge question answering as a verifiable reward. After reinforcement learning on TriviaQA (+9.9%), performance also improves on Natural Questions, HotpotQA, SimpleQA, and StrategyQA by 4.2%, 2.1%, 0.6%, and 3.0%, respectively.

Among these, StreamVGGT leverages frame-wise causal attention to deliver robust and efficient streaming 3D reconstruction. However, it suffers from unbounded growth in the Key-Value (KV) cache due to the massive influx of vision tokens from multi-image and long-video inputs, leading to increased memory consumption and inference latency as input frames accumulate. This ultimately limits its scalability for long-horizon applications. To address this gap, we propose XStreamVGGT, a tuning-free approach that seamlessly integrates pruning and quantization to systematically compress the KV cache, enabling extremely memory-efficient streaming inference. Specifically, redundant KVs generated from multi-frame inputs are initially pruned to conform to a fixed KV memory budget using an efficient token-importance identification mechanism that maintains full compatibility with high-performance attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention). Additionally, leveraging the inherent distribution patterns of KV tensors, we apply dimension-adaptive KV quantization within the pruning pipeline to further minimize memory overhead while preserving numerical accuracy.

Thanks to visionary digital Assyriology projects such as ETCSL, CDLI, and Oracc, a large number of Sumerian transliterations have been published online, and these data are well-structured for a variety of search and analysis tasks. However, the absence of a comprehensive, accessible dataset pairing transliterations with a digital representation of the tablet's cuneiform glyphs has prevented the application of modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to the task of Sumerian transliteration.\n  To address this gap, we present SumTablets, a dataset pairing Unicode representations of 91,606 Sumerian cuneiform tablets (totaling 6,970,407 glyphs) with the associated transliterations published by Oracc. We construct SumTablets by first preprocessing and standardizing the Oracc transliterations before mapping each reading back to the Unicode representation of the source glyph. Further, we retain parallel structural information (e.g., surfaces, newlines, broken segments) through the use of special tokens. We release SumTablets as a Hugging Face Dataset (CC BY 4.0) and open source data preparation code via GitHub.\n  Additionally, we leverage SumTablets to implement and evaluate two transliteration baselines: (1) weighted sampling from a glyph's possible readings, and (2) fine-tuning an autoregressive language model. Our fine-tuned language model achieves an average transliteration character-level F-score (chrF) of 97.55, demonstrating the immediate potential of transformer-based transliteration models in allowing experts to rapidly verify generated transliterations rather than manually transliterating tablets one-by-one.", "AI": {"tldr": "SumTablets\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u8f6c\u5199\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u82cf\u7f8e\u5c14\u8f6c\u5199\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5c06\u82cf\u7f8e\u5c14\u6954\u5f62\u6587\u5b57\u8f6c\u5199\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u7684\u6954\u5f62\u6587\u5b57\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u73b0\u4ee3\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\uff08NLP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u82cf\u7f8e\u5c14\u8f6c\u5199\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aSumTablets\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c0691,606\u4e2a\u82cf\u7f8e\u5c14\u6954\u5f62\u6587\u5b57\u8868\u7684Unicode\u8868\u793a\u4e0eOracc\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u5173\u8054\u8f6c\u5199\u914d\u5bf9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316Oracc\u8f6c\u5199\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9605\u8bfb\u6620\u5c04\u56de\u6e90\u56fe\u6807\u7684Unicode\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6784\u5efaSumTablets\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u6b8a\u6807\u8bb0\u4fdd\u7559\u5e76\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u8868\u9762\u3001\u6362\u884c\u3001\u65ad\u88c2\u6bb5\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u8f6c\u5199\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1a1\uff09\u4ece\u56fe\u6807\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u9605\u8bfb\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u52a0\u6743\u91c7\u6837\uff1b2\uff09\u5fae\u8c03\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f6c\u5199\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7\u522b\u7684chrF\u5f97\u5206\u8fbe\u523097.55\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u8f6c\u5199\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5141\u8bb8\u4e13\u5bb6\u5feb\u901f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f6c\u5199\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SumTablets\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u82cf\u7f8e\u5c14\u8f6c\u5199\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u8f6c\u5199\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u8f6c\u5199\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing statistical inference or iterative optimization techniques that struggle to mitigate the cumulative errors in multi-stage pipelines often lead to limited performance or high computational cost. In contrast, we propose a fully learning-based approach that directly infers moving objects from latent feature representations via attention mechanisms, thus enabling end-to-end feed-forward motion segmentation. Our key insight is to bypass explicit correspondence estimation and instead let the model learn to implicitly disentangle object and camera motion. Supported by recent advances in 4D scene geometry reconstruction (e.g., $\u03c0^3$), the proposed method leverages reliable camera poses and rich spatial-temporal priors, which ensure stable training and robust inference for the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by eliminating complex pre-processing and iterative refinement, our approach achieves state-of-the-art motion segmentation performance with high efficiency.

However, the increasing scale of tabular data poses significant computational and storage challenges to learning-based analytical systems. This highlights the need for data-efficient learning, which enables effective model training and generalization using substantially fewer samples. Dataset condensation (DC) has emerged as a promising data-centric paradigm that synthesizes small yet informative datasets to preserve data utility while reducing storage and training costs. However, existing DC methods are computationally intensive due to reliance on complex gradient-based optimization. Moreover, they often overlook key characteristics of tabular data, such as heterogeneous features and class imbalance. To address these limitations, we introduce C$^{2}$TC (Class-Adaptive Clustering for Tabular Condensation), the first training-free tabular dataset condensation framework that jointly optimizes class allocation and feature representation, enabling efficient and scalable condensation. Specifically, we reformulate the dataset condensation objective into a novel class-adaptive cluster allocation problem (CCAP), which eliminates costly training and integrates adaptive label allocation to handle class imbalance.

Like large language models (LLMs), they are typically trained as deep transformers with next-token or masked-token prediction objectives on massive sequence corpora and are scaled by increasing model depth. Recent work on autoregressive LLMs has identified the Curse of Depth: later layers contribute little to the final output predictions. These findings naturally raise the question of whether a similar depth inefficiency also appears in PLMs, where many widely used models are not autoregressive, and some are multimodal, accepting both protein sequence and structure as input. In this work, we present a depth analysis of six popular PLMs across model families and scales, spanning three training objectives, namely autoregressive, masked, and diffusion, and quantify how layer contributions evolve with depth using a unified set of probing- and perturbation-based measurements. Across all models, we observe consistent depth-dependent patterns that extend prior findings on LLMs: later layers depend less on earlier computations and mainly refine the final output distribution, and these effects are increasingly pronounced in deeper models. Taken together, our results suggest that PLMs exhibit a form of depth inefficiency, motivating future work on more depth-efficient architectures and training methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "This study finds that PLMs have depth inefficiency, similar to LLMs, suggesting a need for more efficient architectures and training methods.", "motivation": "Recent findings on autoregressive LLMs suggest depth inefficiency.

While recent progress in fMRI-based image reconstruction has been notable, extending this success to video reconstruction remains a significant challenge. Current fMRI-to-video reconstruction approaches consistently encounter two major shortcomings: (i) inconsistent visual representations of salient objects across frames, leading to appearance mismatches; (ii) poor temporal coherence, resulting in motion misalignment or abrupt frame transitions. To address these limitations, we introduce SemVideo, a novel fMRI-to-video reconstruction framework guided by hierarchical semantic information. At the core of SemVideo is SemMiner, a hierarchical guidance module that constructs three levels of semantic cues from the original video stimulus: static anchor descriptions, motion-oriented narratives, and holistic summaries. Leveraging this semantic guidance, SemVideo comprises three key components: a Semantic Alignment Decoder that aligns fMRI signals with CLIP-style embeddings derived from SemMiner, a Motion Adaptation Decoder that reconstructs dynamic motion patterns using a novel tripartite attention fusion architecture, and a Conditional Video Render that leverages hierarchical semantic guidance for video reconstruction. Experiments conducted on the CC2017 and HCP datasets demonstrate that SemVideo achieves superior performance in both semantic alignment and temporal consistency, setting a new state-of-the-art in fMRI-to-video reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "SemVideo\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684fMRI\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5236", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSemVideo\u7684fMRI\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u6307\u5bfc", "result": "\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728fMRI\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6c34\u5e73", "conclusion": "SemVideo\u5728fMRI\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf"}}

While deep learning models achieve strong performance under stationary conditions, their accuracy often degrades significantly when faced with distribution shifts caused by external events or evolving urban dynamics. Frequent model retraining to adapt to such changes incurs prohibitive computational costs, especially for large-scale or foundation models. To address this challenge, we propose FORESEE (Forecasting Online with Residual Smoothing and Ensemble Experts), a lightweight online adaptation framework that is accurate, robust, and computationally efficient. FORESEE operates without any parameter updates to the base model. Instead, it corrects today's forecast in each region using yesterday's prediction error, stabilized through exponential smoothing guided by a mixture-of-experts mechanism that adapts to recent error dynamics. Moreover, an adaptive spatiotemporal smoothing component propagates error signals across neighboring regions and time slots, capturing coherent shifts in demand patterns. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets with three backbone models demonstrate that FORESEE consistently improves prediction accuracy, maintains robustness even when distribution shifts are minimal (avoiding performance degradation), and achieves the lowest computational overhead among existing online methods. By enabling real-time adaptation of traffic forecasting models with negligible computational cost, FORESEE paves the way for deploying reliable, up-to-date prediction systems in dynamic urban environments.

However, its effectiveness can be severely undermined in real-world scenarios where models learn unintended biases from spurious correlations within the data. This paper investigates the unique challenges of unlearning from such biased models. We identify a novel phenomenon we term ``shortcut unlearning,\" where models exhibit an ``easy to learn, yet hard to forget\" tendency. Specifically, models struggle to forget easily-learned, bias-aligned samples; instead of forgetting the class attribute, they unlearn the bias attribute, which can paradoxically improve accuracy on the class intended to be forgotten. To address this, we propose CUPID, a new unlearning framework inspired by the observation that samples with different biases exhibit distinct loss landscape sharpness. Our method first partitions the forget set into causal- and bias-approximated subsets based on sample sharpness, then disentangles model parameters into causal and bias pathways, and finally performs a targeted update by routing refined causal and bias gradients to their respective pathways.

As a result, they do not capture the unified capabilities that these models are designed to deliver. To address this gap, we introduce UniVBench, a benchmark purpose-built for evaluating video foundation models across four core abilities: video understanding, video generation, video editing, and a newly proposed task, video reconstruction, which assesses how faithfully a model can reproduce video content it has encountered. Our benchmark substantially expands the complexity of evaluation by incorporating 200 high-quality, diverse and multi-shot videos, each paired with detailed captions, multi-format editing instructions, and reference images. All videos are human-created and carefully validated, offering richer cinematic information than prior benchmarks. In addition, we develop a unified agentic evaluation system (UniV-Eval) that standardizes prompting, instruction parsing, and scoring across all tasks, enabling fair, scalable, and reproducible comparisons of unified video models.

To achieve robustness against various distortions, current methods commonly adopt a training strategy where a \\underline{\\textbf{s}}ingle \\underline{\\textbf{r}}andom \\underline{\\textbf{d}}istortion (SRD) is chosen as the noise layer in each training batch. However, the SRD strategy treats distortions independently within each batch, neglecting the inherent relationships among different types of distortions and causing optimization conflicts across batches. As a result, the robustness and generalizability of the watermarking model are limited. To address this issue, we propose a novel training strategy that enhances robustness and generalization via \\underline{\\textbf{meta}}-learning with \\underline{\\textbf{f}}eature \\underline{\\textbf{c}}onsistency (Meta-FC). Specifically, we randomly sample multiple distortions from the noise pool to construct a meta-training task, while holding out one distortion as a simulated ``unknown'' distortion for the meta-testing phase. Through meta-learning, the model is encouraged to identify and utilize neurons that exhibit stable activations across different types of distortions, mitigating the optimization conflicts caused by the random sampling of diverse distortions in each batch. To further promote the transformation of stable activations into distortion-invariant representations, we introduce a feature consistency loss that constrains the decoded features of the same image subjected to different distortions to remain consistent. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to the SRD training strategy, Meta-FC improves the robustness and generalization of various watermarking models by an average of 1.59\\%, 4.71\\%, and 2.38\\% under high-intensity, combined, and unknown distortions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose DocDjinn, a novel framework for controllable synthetic document generation using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that produces annotated documents from unlabeled seed samples. Our approach generates visually plausible and semantically consistent synthetic documents that follow the distribution of an existing source dataset through clustering-based seed selection with parametrized sampling. By enriching documents with realistic diffusion-based handwriting and contextual visual elements via semantic-visual decoupling, we generate diverse, high-quality annotated synthetic documents. We evaluate across eleven benchmarks spanning key information extraction, question answering, document classification, and document layout analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating that VLMs can generate faithful annotated document datasets at scale from unlabeled seeds that can effectively enrich or approximate real, manually annotated data for diverse document understanding tasks.

However, enabling VLMs to effectively comprehend structured graphs and perform accurate, efficient QA remains challenging. Existing approaches typically rely on one single graph topology representation (GTR), such as fixed-style visual images or unified text descriptions. This ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy often neglects model-specific and task-specific preferences, resulting in inaccurate or over-lengthy responses to graph-related queries.

This work introduces an open-source Python library xai-cola, which provides an end-to-end pipeline for sparsifying CEs produced by arbitrary generators, reducing superfluous feature changes while preserving their validity. It offers a documented API that takes as input raw tabular data in pandas DataFrame form, a preprocessing object (for standardization and encoding), and a trained scikit-learn or PyTorch model. On this basis, users can either employ the built-in or externally imported CE generators. The library also implements several sparsification policies and includes visualization routines for analysing and comparing sparsified counterfactuals. xai-cola is released under the MIT license and can be installed from PyPI. Empirical experiments indicate that xai-cola produces sparser counterfactuals across several CE generators, reducing the number of modified features by up to 50% in our setting.

However, conventional FL faces two critical challenges in real-world deployment: ineffective knowledge fusion caused by model updates biased toward majority-class features, and prohibitive communication overhead due to frequent transmissions of high-dimensional model parameters. Inspired by the human brain's efficiency in knowledge integration, we propose a novel Generative Federated Prototype Learning (GFPL) framework to address these issues. Within this framework, a prototype generation method based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) captures the statistical information of class-wise features, while a prototype aggregation strategy using Bhattacharyya distance effectively fuses semantically similar knowledge across clients. In addition, these fused prototypes are leveraged to generate pseudo-features, thereby mitigating feature distribution imbalance across clients. To further enhance feature alignment during local training, we devise a dual-classifier architecture, optimized via a hybrid loss combining Dot Regression and Cross-Entropy.

A natural question arises from this phenomenon: Which component of the LVLM pipeline primarily contributes to object hallucinations? The vision encoder to perceive visual information, or the language decoder to generate text responses? In this work, we strive to answer this question through designing a systematic experiment to analyze the roles of the vision encoder and the language decoder in hallucination generation. Our observations reveal that object hallucinations are predominantly associated with the strong priors from the language decoder. Based on this finding, we propose a simple and training-free framework, No-Language-Hallucination Decoding, NoLan, which refines the output distribution by dynamically suppressing language priors, modulated based on the output distribution difference between multimodal and text-only inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that NoLan effectively reduces object hallucinations across various LVLMs on different tasks. For instance, NoLan achieves substantial improvements on POPE, enhancing the accuracy of LLaVA-1.5 7B and Qwen-VL 7B by up to 6.45 and 7.21, respectively.

Yet, none of these paradigms supports users at capture time, when the crucial question is how to improve a photo memorability. We introduce the task of Memorability Feedback (MemFeed), where an automated model should provide actionable, human-interpretable guidance to users with the goal to enhance an image future recall. We also present MemCoach, the first approach designed to provide concrete suggestions in natural language for memorability improvement (e.g., \"emphasize facial expression,\" \"bring the subject forward\"). Our method, based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), is training-free and employs a teacher-student steering strategy, aligning the model internal activations toward more memorable patterns learned from a teacher model progressing along least-to-most memorable samples. To enable systematic evaluation on this novel task, we further introduce MemBench, a new benchmark featuring sequence-aligned photoshoots with annotated memorability scores.

Orthogonal-based training methods have gained attention for their efficiency and strong theoretical properties, and many existing approaches enforce orthogonality through gradient projection. In this paper, we revisit orthogonality and exploit the fact that small singular values correspond to directions that are nearly orthogonal to the input space of previous tasks. Building on this principle, we introduce NESS (Null-space Estimated from Small Singular values), a CL method that applies orthogonality directly in the weight space rather than through gradient manipulation. Specifically, NESS constructs an approximate null space using the smallest singular values of each layer's input representation and parameterizes task-specific updates via a compact low-rank adaptation (LoRA-style) formulation constrained to this subspace. The subspace basis is fixed to preserve the null-space constraint, and only a single trainable matrix is learned for each task. This design ensures that the resulting updates remain approximately in the null space of previous inputs while enabling adaptation to new tasks. Our theoretical analysis and experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate competitive performance, low forgetting, and stable accuracy across tasks, highlighting the role of small singular values in continual learning.

Fine-tuning pretrained models heavily relies on endoscopic surgical datasets with precise depth annotations. While existing self-supervised depth estimation techniques eliminate the need for accurate depth annotations, their performance degrades in environments with weak textures and variable lighting, leading to sparse reconstruction with invalid depth estimation. Depth completion using sparse depth maps can mitigate these issues and improve accuracy. Despite the advances in depth completion techniques in general fields, their application in endoscopy remains limited. To overcome these limitations, we propose EndoDDC, an endoscopy depth completion method that integrates images, sparse depth information with depth gradient features, and optimizes depth maps through a diffusion model, addressing the issues of weak texture and light reflection in endoscopic environments. Extensive experiments on two publicly available endoscopy datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in both depth accuracy and robustness. This demonstrates the potential of our method to reduce visual errors in complex endoscopic environments.

Therefore, the ability to detect clouds 24/7 is of paramount importance. While visible and near-infrared bands are effective for daytime cloud detection, their dependence on solar illumination makes them unsuitable for nighttime monitoring. In contrast, thermal infrared (TIR) imagery plays a crucial role in detecting clouds at night, when sunlight is absent. Due to their generally lower temperatures, clouds emit distinct thermal signatures that are detectable in TIR bands. Despite this, accurate nighttime cloud detection remains challenging due to limited spectral information and the typically lower spatial resolution of TIR imagery. To address these challenges, we present TIRAuxCloud, a multi-modal dataset centered around thermal spectral data to facilitate cloud segmentation under both daytime and nighttime conditions. The dataset comprises a unique combination of multispectral data (TIR, optical, and near-infrared bands) from Landsat and VIIRS, aligned with auxiliary information layers.

Previous methods rely on video generation models with external memory for consistency, or iterative 3D reconstruction and inpainting, which accumulate errors during inference due to incorrect intermediary outputs, non-differentiable processes, and separate models. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ``geometry-as-context\". It iteratively completes the following steps using an autoregressive camera-controlled video generation model: (1) estimates the geometry of the current view necessary for 3D reconstruction, and (2) simulates and restores novel view images rendered by the 3D scene. Under this multi-task framework, we develop the camera gated attention module to enhance the model's capability to effectively leverage camera poses. During the training phase, text contexts are utilized to ascertain whether geometric or RGB images should be generated. To ensure that the model can generate RGB-only outputs during inference, the geometry context is randomly dropped from the interleaved text-image-geometry training sequence. The method has been tested on scene video generation with one-direction and forth-and-back trajectories.

At its core is CARD-ViT, a self-supervised Vision Transformer trained exclusively on gated CT data using DINO. Without any non-gated training data, our framework achieves 0.707 accuracy and a Cohen's kappa of 0.528 on the Stanford non-gated dataset, matching models trained directly on non-gated scans. On gated test sets, the framework achieves 0.910 accuracy with Cohen's kappa scores of 0.871 and 0.874 across independent datasets, demonstrating robust risk stratification.

However, most existing ordinal regression approaches model DR severity as a set of static, symmetric ranks, capturing relative order while ignoring the inherent unidirectional nature of disease progression. As a result, the learned feature representations may violate biological plausibility, allowing implausible proximity between non-consecutive stages or even reverse transitions. To bridge this gap, we propose Directed Ordinal Diffusion Regularization (D-ODR), which explicitly models the feature space as a directed flow by constructing a progression-constrained directed graph that strictly enforces forward disease evolution. By performing multi-scale diffusion on this directed structure, D-ODR imposes penalties on score inversions along valid progression paths, thereby effectively preventing the model from learning biologically inconsistent reverse transitions.

It is a valuable tool to gain a deeper understanding of diseases with a long disease trajectory, such as Alzheimer's disease. A key limitation of most disease progression models is that they are specific to a single data type (e.g., continuous data), thereby limiting their applicability to heterogeneous, real-world datasets. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixed Events model, a novel disease progression model that handles both discrete and continuous data types. This model is implemented within the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) framework, resulting in Mixed-SuStaIn, enabling subtype and progression modeling.

It decomposes denoising into local texture extraction and global context aggregation, fused via a spatially aware patch fusion strategy. This design enables effective noise suppression while preserving fine structural and anatomical details. PatchDenoiser is ultra-lightweight, with far fewer parameters and lower computational complexity than CNN-, GAN-, and transformer-based denoisers.\n  On the 2016 Mayo Low-Dose CT dataset, PatchDenoiser consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CNN- and GAN-based methods in PSNR and SSIM. It is robust to variations in slice thickness, reconstruction kernels, and HU windows, generalizes across scanners without fine-tuning, and reduces parameters by ~9x and energy consumption per inference by ~27x compared with conventional CNN denoisers.\n  PatchDenoiser thus provides a practical, scalable, and computationally efficient solution for medical image denoising, balancing performance, robustness, and clinical deployability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Chain-of-Thought (CoT), as VLM's widely used reasoning strategy, is facing critical challenges. Existing textual CoT has a large gap between text semantic space and trajectory physical space. Although the recent approach utilizes future image to replace text as CoT process, it lacks clear planning-oriented objective guidance to generate images with accurate scene evolution. To address these, we innovatively propose MindDriver, a progressive multimodal reasoning framework that enables VLM to imitate human-like progressive thinking for autonomous driving. MindDriver presents semantic understanding, semantic-to-physical space imagination, and physical-space trajectory planning. To achieve aligned reasoning processes in MindDriver, we develop a feedback-guided automatic data annotation pipeline to generate aligned multimodal reasoning training data. Furthermore, we develop a progressive reinforcement fine-tuning method to optimize the alignment through progressive high- level reward-based learning. MindDriver demonstrates superior performance in both nuScences open-loop and Bench2Drive closed-loop evaluation.

Hoeffding trees and their variants have a long-standing tradition due to their effectiveness, either alone or as base models in broader ensembles. At the same time a recent line of work in batch learning has shown that kernel density estimation (KDE) is an effective approach for smoothed predictions in imbalanced regression tasks [Yang et al., 2021]. Moreover, another recent line of work for batch learning, called hierarchical shrinkage (HS) [Agarwal et al., 2022], has introduced a post-hoc regularization method for decision trees that does not alter the structure of the learned tree. Using a telescoping argument we cast KDE to streaming environments and extend the implementation of HS to incremental decision tree models. Armed with these extensions we investigate the performance of decision trees that may enjoy such options in datasets commonly used for regression in online settings. We conclude that KDE is beneficial in the early parts of the stream, while HS hardly, if ever, offers performance benefits.

Existing TIMT methods, whether cascaded pipelines or end-to-end multimodal large language models (MLLMs),struggle with high-resolution text-rich images due to cluttered layouts, diverse fonts, and non-textual distractions, resulting in text omission, semantic drift, and contextual inconsistency. To address these challenges, we propose GLoTran, a global-local dual visual perception framework for MLLM-based TIMT. GLoTran integrates a low-resolution global image with multi-scale region-level text image slices under an instruction-guided alignment strategy, conditioning MLLMs to maintain scene-level contextual consistency while faithfully capturing fine-grained textual details. Moreover, to realize this dual-perception paradigm, we construct GLoD, a large-scale text-rich TIMT dataset comprising 510K high-resolution global-local image-text pairs covering diverse real-world scenarios.

Since geometric verification is expensive, SfM pipelines restrict the pose graph to a sparse set of candidate edges, making initialization critical. Existing methods rely on image retrieval to connect each image to its $k$ nearest neighbors, treating pairs independently and ignoring global consistency. We address this limitation through the concept of edge prioritization, ranking candidate edges by their utility for SfM. Our approach has three components: (1) a GNN trained with SfM-derived supervision to predict globally consistent edge reliability; (2) multi-minimal-spanning-tree-based pose graph construction guided by these ranks; and (3) connectivity-aware score modulation that reinforces weak regions and reduces graph diameter. This globally informed initialization yields more reliable and compact pose graphs, improving reconstruction accuracy in sparse and high-speed settings and outperforming SOTA retrieval methods on ambiguous scenes.

Kane", "Sihan Liu"], "title": "Sample Complexity Bounds for Robust Mean Estimation with Mean-Shift Contamination", "comment": null, "summary": "We study the basic task of mean estimation in the presence of mean-shift contamination. In the mean-shift contamination model, an adversary is allowed to replace a small constant fraction of the clean samples by samples drawn from arbitrarily shifted versions of the base distribution. Prior work characterized the sample complexity of this task for the special cases of the Gaussian and Laplace distributions. Specifically, it was shown that consistent estimation is possible in these cases, a property that is provably impossible in Huber's contamination model. An open question posed in earlier work was to determine the sample complexity of mean estimation in the mean-shift contamination model for general base distributions. In this work, we study and essentially resolve this open question.

However, the same modular and plug-and-play flexibility that makes LoRA appealing also introduces a broader attack surface. To highlight this risk, we propose Masquerade-LoRA (MasqLoRA), the first systematic attack framework that leverages an independent LoRA module as the attack vehicle to stealthily inject malicious behavior into text-to-image diffusion models. MasqLoRA operates by freezing the base model parameters and updating only the low-rank adapter weights using a small number of \"trigger word-target image\" pairs. This enables the attacker to train a standalone backdoor LoRA module that embeds a hidden cross-modal mapping: when the module is loaded and a specific textual trigger is provided, the model produces a predefined visual output; otherwise, it behaves indistinguishably from the benign model, ensuring the stealthiness of the attack. Experimental results demonstrate that MasqLoRA can be trained with minimal resource overhead and achieves a high attack success rate of 99.8%.

While RLHF with expected reward constraints can be formulated as a primal-dual optimization problem, standard primal-dual methods only guarantee convergence with a distributional policy where the saddle-point problem is in convex-concave form. Moreover, standard primal-dual methods may exhibit instability or divergence in the last iterate under policy parameterization in practical applications. In this work, we propose a universal primal-dual framework for safe RLHF that unifies a broad class of existing alignment algorithms, including safe-RLHF, one-shot, and multi-shot based methods. Building on this framework, we introduce an optimistic primal-dual (OPD) algorithm that incorporates predictive updates for both primal and dual variables to stabilize saddle-point dynamics. We establish last-iterate convergence guarantees for the proposed method, covering both exact policy optimization in the distributional space and convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution whose gap is related to approximation error and bias under parameterized policies.

However, existing VisRAG models degrade in performance when visual inputs suffer from distortions such as blur, noise, low light, or shadow, where semantic and degradation factors become entangled within pretrained visual encoders, leading to errors in both retrieval and generation stages. To address this limitation, we introduce RobustVisRAG, a causality-guided dual-path framework that improves VisRAG robustness while preserving efficiency and zero-shot generalization. RobustVisRAG uses a non-causal path to capture degradation signals through unidirectional attention and a causal path to learn purified semantics guided by these signals. Together with the proposed Non-Causal Distortion Modeling and Causal Semantic Alignment objectives, the framework enforces a clear separation between semantics and degradations, enabling stable retrieval and generation under challenging visual conditions. To evaluate robustness under realistic conditions, we introduce the Distortion-VisRAG dataset, a large-scale benchmark containing both synthetic and real-world degraded documents across seven domains, with 12 synthetic and 5 real distortion types that comprehensively reflect practical visual degradations. Experimental results show that RobustVisRAG improves retrieval, generation, and end-to-end performance by 7.35%, 6.35%, and 12.40%, respectively, on real-world degradations, while maintaining comparable accuracy on clean inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "RobustVisRAG\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86VisRAG\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u9000\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709VisRAG\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u53d7\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u4f4e\u5149\u7167\u6216\u9634\u5f71\u7b49\u626d\u66f2\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRobustVisRAG\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5f15\u5bfc\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u8def\u5f84\u6355\u83b7\u9000\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u8def\u5f84\u5b66\u4e60\u7531\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7eaf\u51c0\u8bed\u4e49", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u9000\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cRobustVisRAG\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e867.35%\u30016.35%\u548c12.40%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u53ef\u6bd4\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "conclusion": "RobustVisRAG\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86VisRAG\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u751f\u6210"}}

We introduce Olbedo, a large-scale aerial dataset for outdoor albedo--shading decomposition in the wild. Olbedo contains 5,664 UAV images captured across four landscape types, multiple years, and diverse illumination conditions. Each view is accompanied by multi-view consistent albedo and shading maps, metric depth, surface normals, sun and sky shading components, camera poses, and, for recent flights, measured HDR sky domes. These annotations are derived from an inverse-rendering refinement pipeline over multi-view stereo reconstructions and calibrated sky illumination, together with per-pixel confidence masks. We demonstrate that Olbedo enables state-of-the-art diffusion-based IID models, originally trained on synthetic indoor data, to generalize to real outdoor imagery: fine-tuning on Olbedo significantly improves single-view outdoor albedo prediction on the MatrixCity benchmark. We further illustrate applications of Olbedo-trained models to multi-view consistent relighting of 3D assets, material editing, and scene change analysis for urban digital twins.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a new RGB-Thermal RMOT task, named RT-RMOT, which aims to fuse RGB appearance features with the illumination robustness of the thermal modality to enable all-day referring multi-object tracking. To promote research on RT-RMOT, we construct the first Referring Multi-Object Tracking dataset under RGB-Thermal modality, named RefRT. It contains 388 language descriptions, 1,250 tracked targets, and 166,147 Language-RGB-Thermal (L-RGB-T) triplets. Furthermore, we propose RTrack, a framework built upon a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that integrates RGB, thermal, and textual features. Since the initial framework still leaves room for improvement, we introduce a Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) strategy to further exploit the model's potential. To alleviate training instability during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a Clipped Advantage Scaling (CAS) strategy to suppress gradient explosion. In addition, we design Structured Output Reward and Comprehensive Detection Reward to balance exploration and exploitation, thereby improving the completeness and accuracy of target perception.

The final version will be available on IEEE Xplore. To IEEE SaTML 2026", "summary": "Advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to the development of various protection strategies to prevent the unauthorized use of images. These methods rely on adding imperceptible protective perturbations to images to thwart misuse such as style mimicry or deepfake manipulations. Although previous attacks on these protections required specialized, purpose-built methods, we demonstrate that this is no longer necessary. We show that off-the-shelf image-to-image GenAI models can be repurposed as generic ``denoisers\" using a simple text prompt, effectively removing a wide range of protective perturbations. Across 8 case studies spanning 6 diverse protection schemes, our general-purpose attack not only circumvents these defenses but also outperforms existing specialized attacks while preserving the image's utility for the adversary. Our findings reveal a critical and widespread vulnerability in the current landscape of image protection, indicating that many schemes provide a false sense of security. We stress the urgent need to develop robust defenses and establish that any future protection mechanism must be benchmarked against attacks from off-the-shelf GenAI models.

Existing methods typically process all frames uniformly, overlooking the inherent spatio-temporal redundancy in video data. This leads to redundant computation on non-informative regions while limiting overall efficiency. To remain tractable, they often spatially downsample inputs, losing fine-grained details crucial for precise localization. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{AdaSpot}, a simple yet effective framework that processes low-resolution videos to extract global task-relevant features while adaptively selecting the most informative region-of-interest in each frame for high-resolution processing. The selection is performed via an unsupervised, task-aware strategy that maintains spatio-temporal consistency across frames and avoids the training instability of learnable alternatives. This design preserves essential fine-grained visual cues with a marginal computational overhead compared to low-resolution-only baselines, while remaining far more efficient than uniform high-resolution processing. Experiments on standard PES benchmarks demonstrate that \\textbf{AdaSpot} achieves state-of-the-art performance under strict evaluation metrics (\\eg, $+3.96$ and $+2.26$ mAP$@0$ frames on Tennis and FineDiving), while also maintaining strong results under looser metrics.

We therefore propose a label-free, teacher-guided framework for learning autonomous driving representations directly from unposed videos.

To this end, we leverage a feedforward architecture equipped with a lightweight autoregressive module, trained using multi-modal supervisory signals that guide the model to jointly predict current and future point maps, camera poses, semantic segmentation, and motion masks.

Given their broad reach, it is critical to rigorously evaluate how these models portray the world. Existing diversity metrics either rely on curated datasets or focus on surface-level visual similarity, limiting interpretability. We introduce GeoDiv, a framework leveraging large language and vision-language models to assess geographical diversity along two complementary axes: the Socio-Economic Visual Index (SEVI), capturing economic and condition-related cues, and the Visual Diversity Index (VDI), measuring variation in primary entities and backgrounds. Applied to images generated by models such as Stable Diffusion and FLUX.1-dev across $10$ entities and $16$ countries, GeoDiv reveals a consistent lack of diversity and identifies fine-grained attributes where models default to biased portrayals. Strikingly, depictions of countries like India, Nigeria, and Colombia are disproportionately impoverished and worn, reflecting underlying socio-economic biases. These results highlight the need for greater geographical nuance in generative models. GeoDiv provides the first systematic, interpretable framework for measuring such biases, marking a step toward fairer and more inclusive generative systems.

Although text normalization is frequently adopted as a preprocessing step in prior work, its design principles and empirical impact on vision-language pretraining remain insufficiently and systematically examined. In this study, we present MedTri, a deployable normalization framework for medical vision-language pretraining that converts free-text reports into a unified [Anatomical Entity: Radiologic Description + Diagnosis Category] triplet. This structured, anatomy-grounded normalization preserves essential morphological and spatial information while removing stylistic noise and image-irrelevant content, providing consistent and image-grounded textual supervision at scale. Across multiple datasets spanning both X-ray and computed tomography (CT) modalities, we demonstrate that structured, anatomy-grounded text normalization is an important factor in medical vision-language pretraining quality, yielding consistent improvements over raw reports and existing normalization baselines. In addition, we illustrate how this normalization can easily support modular text-level augmentation strategies, including knowledge enrichment and anatomy-grounded counterfactual supervision, which provide complementary gains in robustness and generalization without altering the core normalization process. Together, our results position structured text normalization as a critical and generalizable preprocessing component for medical vision-language learning, while MedTri provides this normalization platform.

Some require conceptual understanding for semantic synthesis, while others rely on localization cues for spatial precision. Forcing these heterogeneous tasks to share a single representation leads to concept`-`localization representational conflict. To address this issue, we propose CoLoGen, a unified diffusion framework that progressively learns and reconciles this concept`-`localization duality. CoLoGen uses a staged curriculum that first builds core conceptual and localization abilities, then adapts them to diverse visual conditions, and finally refines their synergy for complex instruction`-`driven tasks. Central to this process is the Progressive Representation Weaving (PRW) module, which dynamically routes features to specialized experts and stably integrates their outputs across stages. Experiments on editing, controllable generation, and customized generation show that CoLoGen achieves competitive or superior performance, offering a principled representational perspective for unified image generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoLoGen\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8c03\u548c\u6982\u5ff5-\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53cc\u91cd\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8868\u793a\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u6216\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7edf\u4e00\u6761\u4ef6\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6839\u672c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u3002\u4e00\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u6982\u5ff5\u7406\u89e3\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u4efb\u52a1\u5219\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7ebf\u7d22\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u5f3a\u5236\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f02\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u5171\u4eab\u5355\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6982\u5ff5-\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8868\u793a\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCoLoGen\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8c03\u548c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6982\u5ff5-\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53cc\u91cd\u6027\u3002CoLoGen\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u5efa\u7acb\u6838\u5fc3\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7ec6\u5316\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u6e10\u8fdb\u8868\u793a\u7f16\u7ec7\uff08PRW\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u8def\u7531\u5230\u4e13\u4e1a\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5404\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u96c6\u6210\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCoLoGen\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6216\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u8868\u793a\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "CoLoGen\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8c03\u548c\u6982\u5ff5-\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53cc\u91cd\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8868\u793a\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u6216\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

At least 15 different foundation models have been proposed, and the vast majority are trained exclusively with tiles using the 20$\\times$ magnification. However, it is well known that certain histologic features can only be discerned with larger context windows and requires a pathologist to zoom in and out when analyzing a whole slide image. Furthermore, creating 224$\\times$224 pixel crops at 20$\\times$ leads to a large number of tiles per slide, which can be gigapixel in size. To more accurately capture multi-resolution features and investigate the possibility of reducing the number of representations per slide, we propose a region-level mixing encoder.

Current methods typically focus on recovering either hand or object pose in isolation, but both struggle during interactions and fail to handle out-of-sight cases. Moreover, their independent predictions often lead to inconsistent hand-object relations. We introduce WHOLE, a method that holistically reconstructs hand and object motion in world space from egocentric videos given object templates. Our key insight is to learn a generative prior over hand-object motion to jointly reason about their interactions. At test time, the pretrained prior is guided to generate trajectories that conform to the video observations. This joint generative reconstruction substantially outperforms approaches that process hands and objects separately followed by post-processing. WHOLE achieves state-of-the-art performance on hand motion estimation, 6D object pose estimation, and their relative interaction reconstruction.

Existing methods either optimize deformations incrementally, risking drift and requiring long runtimes, or rely on complex learned models that demand category-specific training. We present Neu-PiG, a fast deformation optimization method based on a novel preconditioned latent-grid encoding that distributes spatial features parameterized on the position and normal direction of a keyframe surface. Our method encodes entire deformations across all time steps at various spatial scales into a multi-resolution latent grid, parameterized by the position and normal direction of a reference surface from a single keyframe. This latent representation is then augmented for time modulation and decoded into per-frame 6-DoF deformations via a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP). To achieve high-fidelity, drift-free surface reconstructions in seconds, we employ Sobolev preconditioning during gradient-based training of the latent space, completely avoiding the need for any explicit correspondences or further priors.
