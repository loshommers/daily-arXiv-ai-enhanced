Abstract: Recent advancements in civil infrastructure inspections underscore the need for precise three-dimensional (3D) damage visualization on digital twins, transcending traditional 2D image-based damage identifications. Compared to conventional photogrammetric 3D reconstruction techniques, modern approaches such as Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) excel in scene representation, rendering quality, and handling featureless regions. Among them, GS stands out for its efficiency, leveraging discrete anisotropic 3D Gaussians to represent radiance fields, unlike NeRF's continuous implicit model. This study introduces a GS-enabled digital twin method tailored for effective 3D damage visualization. The method's key contributions include: 1) utilizing GS-based 3D reconstruction to visualize 2D damage segmentation results while reducing segmentation errors; 2) developing a multi-scale reconstruction strategy to balance efficiency and damage detail; 3) enabling digital twin updates as damage evolves over time. Demonstrated on an open-source synthetic dataset for post-earthquake inspections, the proposed approach offers a promising solution for comprehensive 3D damage visualization in civil infrastructure digital twins.

### [2] [Analytic Score Optimization for Multi Dimension Video Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16856)
*Boda Lin,Yongjie Zhu,Wenyu Qin,Meng Wang,Pengfei Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多维VQA数据集和评估方法，提高了视频质量评估的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频质量评估（VQA）正在从单一数字的平均意见评分向更丰富、多方面的视频内容评估发展。

Method: 提出一个大规模的多维VQA数据集UltraVQA，包含五个关键质量维度：运动质量、运动幅度、审美质量、内容质量和清晰度质量。每个视频由超过3名人类评分员在这些维度上进行评分，并伴有基于人类判断的GPT生成的解释性理由。引入分析评分优化（ASO），一个针对多维VQA的理论基础后训练目标。将质量评估重新定义为正则化决策过程，获得一个封闭形式的解决方案，自然捕捉人类评分的序数性质，确保与人类排名偏好的一致性。

Result: 在实验中，该方法优于大多数基线，包括闭源API和开源模型，同时降低了质量预测中的平均绝对误差（MAE）。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了多维、可解释的注释和基于强化的一致性在推进视频质量评估中的重要性。

Abstract: Video Quality Assessment (VQA) is evolving beyond single-number mean opinion score toward richer, multi-faceted evaluations of video content. In this paper, we present a large-scale multi-dimensional VQA dataset UltraVQA that encompasses diverse User-Generated Content~(UGC) annotated across five key quality dimensions: Motion Quality, Motion Amplitude, Aesthetic Quality, Content Quality, and Clarity Quality. Each video in our dataset is scored by over 3 human raters on these dimensions, with fine-grained sub-attribute labels, and accompanied by an explanatory rationale generated by GPT based on the collective human judgments. To better leverage these rich annotations and improve discrete quality score assessment, we introduce Analytic Score Optimization (ASO), a theoretically grounded post-training objective derived for multi-dimensional VQA. By reframing quality assessment as a regularized decision-making process, we obtain a closed-form solution that naturally captures the ordinal nature of human ratings, ensuring alignment with human ranking preferences. In experiments, our method outperforms most baselines including closed-source APIs and open-source models, while also reducing mean absolute error (MAE) in quality prediction. Our work highlights the importance of multi-dimensional, interpretable annotations and reinforcement-based alignment in advancing video quality assessment.

### [3] [DODO: Discrete OCR Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16872)
*Sean Man,Roy Ganz,Roi Ronen,Shahar Tsiper,Shai Mazor,Niv Nayman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DODO模型通过块离散扩散实现了OCR的快速并行解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了克服现有OCR模型在处理长文档时的计算成本和速度问题，提出了一种新的基于扩散模型的并行解码方法。

Method: 引入了DODO模型，利用块离散扩散，将生成过程分解为块，以减轻全局扩散的同步错误。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在准确性方面接近最先进水平，同时比自回归基线快3倍。

Conclusion: DODO模型为OCR任务提供了一种高效的并行解码方法，显著提高了处理速度。

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a fundamental task for digitizing information, serving as a critical bridge between visual data and textual understanding. While modern Vision-Language Models (VLM) have achieved high accuracy in this domain, they predominantly rely on autoregressive decoding, which becomes computationally expensive and slow for long documents as it requires a sequential forward pass for every generated token. We identify a key opportunity to overcome this bottleneck: unlike open-ended generation, OCR is a highly deterministic task where the visual input strictly dictates a unique output sequence, theoretically enabling efficient, parallel decoding via diffusion models. However, we show that existing masked diffusion models fail to harness this potential; those introduce structural instabilities that are benign in flexible tasks, like captioning, but catastrophic for the rigid, exact-match requirements of OCR. To bridge this gap, we introduce DODO, the first VLM to utilize block discrete diffusion and unlock its speedup potential for OCR. By decomposing generation into blocks, DODO mitigates the synchronization errors of global diffusion. Empirically, our method achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy while enabling up to 3x faster inference compared to autoregressive baselines.

*Zeyu Ren,Xiang Li,Yiran Wang,Zeyu Zhang,Hao Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出StereoAdapter-2，显著提高水下立体深度估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下机器人感知中的立体深度估计受到波长相关的光衰减、散射和折射的影响，导致严重的领域迁移。

Method: 提出StereoAdapter-2，使用基于选择性状态空间模型的ConvSS2D算子替换传统的ConvGRU更新器，并构建大规模合成水下立体数据集UW-StereoDepth-80K。

Result: 在TartanAir-UW上提高了17%，在SQUID上提高了7.2%，并在BlueROV2平台上进行了真实世界验证，证明了方法的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: StereoAdapter-2在水下立体深度估计方面取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Stereo depth estimation is fundamental to underwater robotic perception, yet suffers from severe domain shifts caused by wavelength-dependent light attenuation, scattering, and refraction. Recent approaches leverage monocular foundation models with GRU-based iterative refinement for underwater adaptation; however, the sequential gating and local convolutional kernels in GRUs necessitate multiple iterations for long-range disparity propagation, limiting performance in large-disparity and textureless underwater regions. In this paper, we propose StereoAdapter-2, which replaces the conventional ConvGRU updater with a novel ConvSS2D operator based on selective state space models. The proposed operator employs a four-directional scanning strategy that naturally aligns with epipolar geometry while capturing vertical structural consistency, enabling efficient long-range spatial propagation within a single update step at linear computational complexity. Furthermore, we construct UW-StereoDepth-80K, a large-scale synthetic underwater stereo dataset featuring diverse baselines, attenuation coefficients, and scattering parameters through a two-stage generative pipeline combining semantic-aware style transfer and geometry-consistent novel view synthesis. Combined with dynamic LoRA adaptation inherited from StereoAdapter, our framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on underwater benchmarks with 17% improvement on TartanAir-UW and 7.2% improvment on SQUID, with real-world validation on the BlueROV2 platform demonstrates the robustness of our approach.

### [5] [SemCovNet: Towards Fair and Semantic Coverage-Aware Learning for Underrepresented Visual Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16917)
*Sakib Ahammed,Xia Cui,Xinqi Fan,Wenqi Lu,Moi Hoon Yap*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SemCovNet的新型模型，用于解决语义覆盖不平衡问题，提高了模型性能和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有数据集中存在的语义覆盖不平衡（SCI）问题，影响模型对稀有但有意义语义的学习和推理。

Method: 提出了一种名为SemCovNet的新型模型，该模型通过语义描述符地图（SDM）学习语义表示，描述符注意力调制（DAM）模块动态加权视觉和概念特征，以及描述符-视觉对齐（DVA）损失来对齐视觉特征与描述符语义。

Result: 通过多个数据集的实验，证明了SemCovNet提高了模型可靠性，显著降低了CDI，实现了更公平、更均衡的性能。

Conclusion: 将SCI确立为一个可衡量的可纠正偏差，为推进语义公平和可解释视觉学习奠定了基础。

Abstract: Modern vision models increasingly rely on rich semantic representations that extend beyond class labels to include descriptive concepts and contextual attributes. However, existing datasets exhibit Semantic Coverage Imbalance (SCI), a previously overlooked bias arising from the long-tailed semantic representations. Unlike class imbalance, SCI occurs at the semantic level, affecting how models learn and reason about rare yet meaningful semantics. To mitigate SCI, we propose Semantic Coverage-Aware Network (SemCovNet), a novel model that explicitly learns to correct semantic coverage disparities. SemCovNet integrates a Semantic Descriptor Map (SDM) for learning semantic representations, a Descriptor Attention Modulation (DAM) module that dynamically weights visual and concept features, and a Descriptor-Visual Alignment (DVA) loss that aligns visual features with descriptor semantics. We quantify semantic fairness using a Coverage Disparity Index (CDI), which measures the alignment between coverage and error. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SemCovNet enhances model reliability and substantially reduces CDI, achieving fairer and more equitable performance. This work establishes SCI as a measurable and correctable bias, providing a foundation for advancing semantic fairness and interpretable vision learning.

Abstract: We present Xray-Visual, a unified vision model architecture for large-scale image and video understanding trained on industry-scale social media data. Our model leverages over 15 billion curated image-text pairs and 10 billion video-hashtag pairs from Facebook and Instagram, employing robust data curation pipelines that incorporate balancing and noise suppression strategies to maximize semantic diversity while minimizing label noise. We introduce a three-stage training pipeline that combines self-supervised MAE, semi-supervised hashtag classification, and CLIP-style contrastive learning to jointly optimize image and video modalities. Our architecture builds on a Vision Transformer backbone enhanced with efficient token reorganization (EViT) for improved computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Xray-Visual achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks, including ImageNet for image classification, Kinetics and HMDB51 for video understanding, and MSCOCO for cross-modal retrieval. The model exhibits strong robustness to domain shift and adversarial perturbations. We further demonstrate that integrating large language models as text encoders (LLM2CLIP) significantly enhances retrieval performance and generalization capabilities, particularly in real-world environments. Xray-Visual establishes new benchmarks for scalable, multimodal vision models, while maintaining superior accuracy and computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HSI-SC-NeRF：一种适用于农产品检测的高吞吐量高光谱3D重建方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统方法在集成高光谱成像和3D重建时的挑战，提高农产品检测的效率和准确性。

Method: HSI-SC-NeRF使用固定相机和旋转物体，结合多通道NeRF方法和复合光谱损失，实现高光谱数据的高效3D重建。

Result: 实验结果表明，HSI-SC-NeRF在可见光和近红外光谱范围内具有高空间重建精度和光谱保真度。

Conclusion: HSI-SC-NeRF能够有效地进行高吞吐量的高光谱3D重建，适用于农产品检测的自动化农业工作流程。

Abstract: Advances in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and 3D reconstruction have enabled accurate, high-throughput characterization of agricultural produce quality and plant phenotypes, both essential for advancing agricultural sustainability and breeding programs. HSI captures detailed biochemical features of produce, while 3D geometric data substantially improves morphological analysis. However, integrating these two modalities at scale remains challenging, as conventional approaches involve complex hardware setups incompatible with automated phenotyping systems. Recent advances in neural radiance fields (NeRF) offer computationally efficient 3D reconstruction but typically require moving-camera setups, limiting throughput and reproducibility in standard indoor agricultural environments. To address these challenges, we introduce HSI-SC-NeRF, a stationary-camera multi-channel NeRF framework for high-throughput hyperspectral 3D reconstruction targeting postharvest inspection of agricultural produce. Multi-view hyperspectral data is captured using a stationary camera while the object rotates within a custom-built Teflon imaging chamber providing diffuse, uniform illumination. Object poses are estimated via ArUco calibration markers and transformed to the camera frame of reference through simulated pose transformations, enabling standard NeRF training on stationary-camera data. A multi-channel NeRF formulation optimizes reconstruction across all hyperspectral bands jointly using a composite spectral loss, supported by a two-stage training protocol that decouples geometric initialization from radiometric refinement. Experiments on three agricultural produce samples demonstrate high spatial reconstruction accuracy and strong spectral fidelity across the visible and near-infrared spectrum, confirming the suitability of HSI-SC-NeRF for integration into automated agricultural workflows.

*Dahye Kim,Deepti Ghadiyaram,Raghudeep Gadde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 动态标记化通过根据内容复杂性和去噪时间步长调整补丁大小，显著提高了Diffusion Transformers的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers在图像和视频生成中取得了最先进的性能，但其效率低下，因为固定大小的补丁在整个去噪阶段中使用，而不管内容的复杂性。

Method: 提出动态标记化，一种高效的测试时间策略，根据内容复杂性和去噪时间步长变化补丁大小。

Result: 在FLUX-1 Dev和Wan 2.1上分别实现了$3.52	imes$和$3.2	imes$的速度提升，同时保留了生成质量和提示的遵守。

Conclusion: 动态标记化在保持生成质量的同时，显著降低了Diffusion Transformers的计算成本。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image and video generation, but their success comes at the cost of heavy computation. This inefficiency is largely due to the fixed tokenization process, which uses constant-sized patches throughout the entire denoising phase, regardless of the content's complexity. We propose dynamic tokenization, an efficient test-time strategy that varies patch sizes based on content complexity and the denoising timestep. Our key insight is that early timesteps only require coarser patches to model global structure, while later iterations demand finer (smaller-sized) patches to refine local details. During inference, our method dynamically reallocates patch sizes across denoising steps for image and video generation and substantially reduces cost while preserving perceptual generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: it achieves up to $3.52\times$ and $3.2\times$ speedup on FLUX-1.Dev and Wan $2.1$, respectively, without compromising the generation quality and prompt adherence.

*Divyam Madaan,Sumit Chopra,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRIMO是一种多模态学习模型，能够处理缺失模态数据，并在不同数据集上取得与基线相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）在训练和推理过程中通常假设存在多种模态，但在实际应用中，多模态数据往往不完整。

Method: 提出PRIMO，一个监督的潜在变量插补模型，量化了多模态学习设置中任何缺失模态的预测影响。

Result: PRIMO在合成XOR数据集、Audio-Vision MNIST和MIMIC-III数据集上进行了评估，在所有数据集上，当一种模态完全缺失时，PRIMO的性能与单模态基线相当；当所有模态都可用时，与多模态基线相当。

Conclusion: PRIMO能够量化模态在实例层面的预测影响，并通过潜在补全的预测来分析缺失模态对预测的影响。

Abstract: Despite the recent success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), existing approaches predominantly assume the availability of multiple modalities during training and inference. In practice, multimodal data is often incomplete because modalities may be missing, collected asynchronously, or available only for a subset of examples. In this work, we propose PRIMO, a supervised latent-variable imputation model that quantifies the predictive impact of any missing modality within the multimodal learning setting. PRIMO enables the use of all available training examples, whether modalities are complete or partial. Specifically, it models the missing modality through a latent variable that captures its relationship with the observed modality in the context of prediction. During inference, we draw many samples from the learned distribution over the missing modality to both obtain the marginal predictive distribution (for the purpose of prediction) and analyze the impact of the missing modalities on the prediction for each instance. We evaluate PRIMO on a synthetic XOR dataset, Audio-Vision MNIST, and MIMIC-III for mortality and ICD-9 prediction. Across all datasets, PRIMO obtains performance comparable to unimodal baselines when a modality is fully missing and to multimodal baselines when all modalities are available. PRIMO quantifies the predictive impact of a modality at the instance level using a variance-based metric computed from predictions across latent completions. We visually demonstrate how varying completions of the missing modality result in a set of plausible labels.

*Peize Li,Zeyu Zhang,Hao Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PartRAG通过检索增强和部分级编辑，显著提高了单图3D生成的质量和编辑灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单图3D生成中，部分级结构仍然具有挑战性：学习先验难以涵盖部分几何形状的长尾，并保持多视图一致性；现有系统对精确、局部编辑的支持有限。

Method: 提出PartRAG，一个检索增强框架，将外部部分数据库与扩散变换器集成，将生成与可编辑表示相结合。引入分层对比检索模块，在部分和对象粒度上对密集图像块与3D部分潜在变量进行对齐，从1,236个部分注释资产的精选库中检索，将多样化的、物理上合理的实例注入降噪。增加掩码的部分级编辑器，在共享的规范空间中操作，允许交换、属性细化、组合更新，而无需重新生成整个对象，同时保留非目标部分和多视图一致性。

Result: 在Objaverse、ShapeNet和ABO-reducing Chamfer Distance上取得有竞争力的结果，从0.1726降低到0.1528，将F-Score从0.7472提高到0.844。Qualitatively，PartRAG产生更锐利的部分边界，更好的薄结构保真度，以及在关节对象上的鲁棒行为。

Conclusion: PartRAG在单图3D生成和部分级结构方面取得了显著成果，提高了编辑的精度和效率。

Abstract: Single-image 3D generation with part-level structure remains challenging: learned priors struggle to cover the long tail of part geometries and maintain multi-view consistency, and existing systems provide limited support for precise, localized edits. We present PartRAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that integrates an external part database with a diffusion transformer to couple generation with an editable representation. To overcome the first challenge, we introduce a Hierarchical Contrastive Retrieval module that aligns dense image patches with 3D part latents at both part and object granularity, retrieving from a curated bank of 1,236 part-annotated assets to inject diverse, physically plausible exemplars into denoising. To overcome the second challenge, we add a masked, part-level editor that operates in a shared canonical space, enabling swaps, attribute refinements, and compositional updates without regenerating the whole object while preserving non-target parts and multi-view consistency. PartRAG achieves competitive results on Objaverse, ShapeNet, and ABO-reducing Chamfer Distance from 0.1726 to 0.1528 and raising F-Score from 0.7472 to 0.844 on Objaverse-with inference of 38s and interactive edits in 5-8s. Qualitatively, PartRAG produces sharper part boundaries, better thin-structure fidelity, and robust behavior on articulated objects. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/PartRAG.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures have significantly advanced Text-to-Image (T2I) generation but suffer from prohibitive computational costs and deployment barriers. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient compression framework that transforms the 60-layer dual-stream MMDiT-based Qwen-Image into lightweight models without training from scratch. Leveraging this framework, we introduce Amber-Image, a series of streamlined T2I models. We first derive Amber-Image-10B using a timestep-sensitive depth pruning strategy, where retained layers are reinitialized via local weight averaging and optimized through layer-wise distillation and full-parameter fine-tuning. Building on this, we develop Amber-Image-6B by introducing a hybrid-stream architecture that converts deep-layer dual streams into a single stream initialized from the image branch, further refined via progressive distillation and lightweight fine-tuning. Our approach reduces parameters by 70% and eliminates the need for large-scale data engineering. Notably, the entire compression and training pipeline-from the 10B to the 6B variant-requires fewer than 2,000 GPU hours, demonstrating exceptional cost-efficiency compared to training from scratch. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks like DPG-Bench and LongText-Bench show that Amber-Image achieves high-fidelity synthesis and superior text rendering, matching much larger models.

TL;DR: StructCore：超越最大池化的图像级异常检测新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Max pooling在基于内存库的无监督异常检测中是标准方法，但存在信息丢失问题。

Method: 提出StructCore，一种训练-free、结构感知的图像级评分方法。

Result: 在MVTec AD和VisA上，StructCore分别实现了99.6%和98.4%的图像级AUROC评分。

Conclusion: StructCore通过利用最大池化遗漏的结构签名，实现了鲁棒的图像级异常检测。

Abstract: Max pooling is the de facto standard for converting anomaly score maps into image-level decisions in memory-bank-based unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD). However, because it relies on a single extreme response, it discards most information about how anomaly evidence is distributed and structured across the image, often causing normal and anomalous scores to overlap.
  We propose StructCore, a training-free, structure-aware image-level scoring method that goes beyond max pooling. Given an anomaly score map, StructCore computes a low-dimensional structural descriptor phi(S) that captures distributional and spatial characteristics, and refines image-level scoring via a diagonal Mahalanobis calibration estimated from train-good samples, without modifying pixel-level localization.
  StructCore achieves image-level AUROC scores of 99.6% on MVTec AD and 98.4% on VisA, demonstrating robust image-level anomaly detection by exploiting structural signatures missed by max pooling.

TL;DR: Cholec80-port数据集和SOP提高了手术数据集中端口标注的几何一致性，从而增强了基于几何的下游处理的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于手术数据集中缺乏明确的套管端口标签，以及现有的注释经常破坏几何一致性，因此需要创建一个高保真的套管端口分割数据集。

Method: 从Cholec80数据集中派生出Cholec80-port数据集，并定义了一套标准操作程序（SOP），以排除中央开口的端口套管掩码。此外，还清洗并统一了现有的公共数据集。

Result: 实验表明，几何上一致的注释可以显著提高跨数据集的鲁棒性，而不仅仅是数据集大小。

Conclusion: Cholec80-port数据集和SOP有助于提高基于几何的下游处理（如图像拼接、3D重建和视觉SLAM）的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Trocar ports are camera-fixed, pseudo-static structures that can persistently occlude laparoscopic views and attract disproportionate feature points due to specular, textured surfaces. This makes ports particularly detrimental to geometry-based downstream pipelines such as image stitching, 3D reconstruction, and visual SLAM, where dynamic or non-anatomical outliers degrade alignment and tracking stability. Despite this practical importance, explicit port labels are rare in public surgical datasets, and existing annotations often violate geometric consistency by masking the central lumen (opening), even when anatomical regions are visible through it. We present Cholec80-port, a high-fidelity trocar port segmentation dataset derived from Cholec80, together with a rigorous standard operating procedure (SOP) that defines a port-sleeve mask excluding the central opening. We additionally cleanse and unify existing public datasets under the same SOP. Experiments demonstrate that geometrically consistent annotations substantially improve cross-dataset robustness beyond what dataset size alone provides.

TL;DR: ComptonUNet是一种新的混合深度学习框架，用于提高微弱伽玛射线暴的定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探测和定位来自遥远宇宙的微弱伽玛射线暴（GRBs）是具有挑战性的，因为光子统计低且背景噪声大。

Method: 提出了一种名为ComptonUNet的混合深度学习框架，该框架结合了直接重建模型的统计效率和基于图像架构的降噪能力。

Result: ComptonUNet在低统计和高背景场景下显著优于现有方法，提高了定位精度。

Conclusion: ComptonUNet为高效、稳健的GRB定位提供了一种新的解决方案。

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic transient phenomena in the universe and serve as powerful probes for high-energy astrophysical processes. In particular, faint GRBs originating from a distant universe may provide unique insights into the early stages of star formation. However, detecting and localizing such weak sources remains challenging owing to low photon statistics and substantial background noise. Although recent machine learning models address individual aspects of these challenges, they often struggle to balance the trade-off between statistical robustness and noise suppression. Consequently, we propose ComptonUNet, a hybrid deep learning framework that jointly processes raw data and reconstructs images for robust GRB localization. ComptonUNet was designed to operate effectively under conditions of limited photon statistics and strong background contamination by combining the statistical efficiency of direct reconstruction models with the denoising capabilities of image-based architectures. We perform realistic simulations of GRB-like events embedded in background environments representative of low-Earth orbit missions to evaluate the performance of ComptonUNet. Our results demonstrate that ComptonUNet significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving improved localization accuracy across a wide range of low-statistic and high-background scenarios.

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and rendering are core tasks in computer vision, with applications spanning industrial monitoring, robotics, and autonomous driving. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and its variants have achieved impressive rendering fidelity while maintaining high computational and memory efficiency. However, conventional vision-based GS pipelines typically rely on a sufficient number of camera views to initialize the Gaussian primitives and train their parameters, typically incurring additional processing cost during initialization while falling short in conditions where visual cues are unreliable, such as adverse weather, low illumination, or partial occlusions. To cope with these challenges, and motivated by the robustness of radio-frequency (RF) signals to weather, lighting, and occlusions, we introduce a multimodal framework that integrates RF sensing, such as automotive radar, with GS-based rendering as a more efficient and robust alternative to vision-only GS rendering. The proposed approach enables efficient depth prediction from only sparse RF-based depth measurements, yielding a high-quality 3D point cloud for initializing Gaussian functions across diverse GS architectures. Numerical tests demonstrate the merits of judiciously incorporating RF sensing into GS pipelines, achieving high-fidelity 3D scene rendering driven by RF-informed structural accuracy.

TL;DR: B$^3$-Seg是一种快速且高效的3DGS分割方法，适用于实时编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interactive 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) segmentation对于电影和游戏制作中预重建资产的实时编辑至关重要。然而，现有方法依赖于预定义的摄像机视角、地面实况标签或昂贵的重新训练，这使得它们对于低延迟使用不切实际。

Method: 提出B$^3$-Seg（Beta-Bernoulli贝叶斯分割用于3DGS），这是一种在无摄像机和无训练条件下的快速且理论上有根据的开放词汇3DGS分割方法。该方法将分割重新定义为序列Beta-Bernoulli贝叶斯更新，并通过分析期望信息增益（EIG）主动选择下一个视图。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，B$^3$-Seg在几秒钟内完成端到端分割，同时达到与高成本监督方法相媲美的结果。结果表明，B$^3$-Seg可以实现具有可证明的信息效率的实用、交互式3DGS分割。

Conclusion: B$^3$-Seg是一种快速且理论上有根据的方法，可以在无摄像机和无训练条件下进行开放词汇3DGS分割，具有可证明的信息效率。

Abstract: Interactive 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) segmentation is essential for real-time editing of pre-reconstructed assets in film and game production. However, existing methods rely on predefined camera viewpoints, ground-truth labels, or costly retraining, making them impractical for low-latency use. We propose B$^3$-Seg (Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian Segmentation for 3DGS), a fast and theoretically grounded method for open-vocabulary 3DGS segmentation under camera-free and training-free conditions. Our approach reformulates segmentation as sequential Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian updates and actively selects the next view via analytic Expected Information Gain (EIG). This Bayesian formulation guarantees the adaptive monotonicity and submodularity of EIG, which produces a greedy $(1{-}1/e)$ approximation to the optimal view sampling policy. Experiments on multiple datasets show that B$^3$-Seg achieves competitive results to high-cost supervised methods while operating end-to-end segmentation within a few seconds. The results demonstrate that B$^3$-Seg enables practical, interactive 3DGS segmentation with provable information efficiency.

TL;DR: BadCLIP++是一种新的多模态对比学习模型后门攻击框架，通过创新的触发机制和参数稳定性技术，实现了高攻击成功率和高鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究针对多模态对比学习模型的后门攻击面临两大挑战：隐蔽性和持续性。现有方法往往在强大的检测或连续微调下失败，主要是因为（1）跨模态不一致性暴露了触发模式（2）低中毒率下的梯度稀释加速后门遗忘。这些共同原因尚未得到充分建模和解决。

Method: 提出BadCLIP++统一框架，解决两大挑战。为隐蔽性，引入语义融合QR微触发，在任务相关区域附近嵌入不可察觉的模式，同时保持干净数据的统计数据，产生紧凑的触发分布。进一步应用目标对齐的子集选择来加强低注入率下的信号。为持续性，通过半径收缩和质心对齐稳定触发嵌入，通过曲率控制和弹性权重巩固稳定模型参数，保持解决方案在低曲率宽盆地内，抵抗微调。还提供了第一个理论分析，表明在信任区域内，干净微调和后门目标梯度是同方向的，从而在攻击成功度下降上给出了非增加的上界。

Result: BadCLIP++在数字环境中仅用0.3%的中毒率实现了99.99%的攻击成功率（ASR），超过基线11.4个百分点。在十九种防御中，ASR仍保持在99.90%以上，干净精度下降不到0.8%。该方法在物理攻击中达到65.03%的成功率，并对水印去除防御表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BadCLIP++是一种有效的针对多模态对比学习模型后门攻击的框架，具有高隐蔽性和持续性，并在数字和物理攻击中表现出色。

Abstract: Research on backdoor attacks against multimodal contrastive learning models faces two key challenges: stealthiness and persistence. Existing methods often fail under strong detection or continuous fine-tuning, largely due to (1) cross-modal inconsistency that exposes trigger patterns and (2) gradient dilution at low poisoning rates that accelerates backdoor forgetting. These coupled causes remain insufficiently modeled and addressed. We propose BadCLIP++, a unified framework that tackles both challenges. For stealthiness, we introduce a semantic-fusion QR micro-trigger that embeds imperceptible patterns near task-relevant regions, preserving clean-data statistics while producing compact trigger distributions. We further apply target-aligned subset selection to strengthen signals at low injection rates. For persistence, we stabilize trigger embeddings via radius shrinkage and centroid alignment, and stabilize model parameters through curvature control and elastic weight consolidation, maintaining solutions within a low-curvature wide basin resistant to fine-tuning. We also provide the first theoretical analysis showing that, within a trust region, gradients from clean fine-tuning and backdoor objectives are co-directional, yielding a non-increasing upper bound on attack success degradation. Experiments demonstrate that with only 0.3% poisoning, BadCLIP++ achieves 99.99% attack success rate (ASR) in digital settings, surpassing baselines by 11.4 points. Across nineteen defenses, ASR remains above 99.90% with less than 0.8% drop in clean accuracy. The method further attains 65.03% success in physical attacks and shows robustness against watermark removal defenses.

Conclusion: NRGS-SLAM在多个公开的内窥镜数据集上实现了比最先进方法更准确的相机姿态估计和更高质量的重建。

Abstract: Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (V-SLAM) is a fundamental capability for autonomous perception and navigation. However, endoscopic scenes violate the rigidity assumption due to persistent soft-tissue deformations, creating a strong coupling ambiguity between camera ego-motion and intrinsic deformation. Although recent monocular non-rigid SLAM methods have made notable progress, they often lack effective decoupling mechanisms and rely on sparse or low-fidelity scene representations, which leads to tracking drift and limited reconstruction quality. To address these limitations, we propose NRGS-SLAM, a monocular non-rigid SLAM system for endoscopy based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. To resolve the coupling ambiguity, we introduce a deformation-aware 3D Gaussian map that augments each Gaussian primitive with a learnable deformation probability, optimized via a Bayesian self-supervision strategy without requiring external non-rigidity labels. Building on this representation, we design a deformable tracking module that performs robust coarse-to-fine pose estimation by prioritizing low-deformation regions, followed by efficient per-frame deformation updates. A carefully designed deformable mapping module progressively expands and refines the map, balancing representational capacity and computational efficiency. In addition, a unified robust geometric loss incorporates external geometric priors to mitigate the inherent ill-posedness of monocular non-rigid SLAM. Extensive experiments on multiple public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that NRGS-SLAM achieves more accurate camera pose estimation (up to 50\% reduction in RMSE) and higher-quality photo-realistic reconstructions than state-of-the-art methods. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our key design choices. Source code will be publicly available upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet they often suffer from language bias, producing answers without relying on visual evidence. While prior work attempts to mitigate this issue through decoding strategies, architectural modifications, or curated instruction data, they typically lack a quantitative measure of how much individual training samples or tokens actually benefit from the image. In this work, we introduce Visual Information Gain (VIG), a perplexity-based metric that measures the reduction in prediction uncertainty provided by visual input. VIG enables fine-grained analysis at both sample and token levels, effectively highlighting visually grounded elements such as colors, spatial relations, and attributes. Leveraging this, we propose a VIG-guided selective training scheme that prioritizes high-VIG samples and tokens. This approach improves visual grounding and mitigates language bias, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced supervision by focusing exclusively on visually informative samples and tokens.

TL;DR: EntropyPrune通过矩阵熵和谱等价性加速MLLMs推理，提高了性能和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在推理时因处理每张图像的数百个视觉标记而造成巨大的推理成本。虽然标记剪枝已被证明可以加速推理，但何时以及如何剪枝仍然主要依赖于启发式方法。现有的方法通常依赖于静态、经验选择的层，这限制了可解释性和模型之间的迁移性。

Method: 提出了一种基于矩阵熵的视角，识别出“熵坍缩层”（ECL），在ECL中，视觉表示的信息内容呈现出急剧且一致下降，为选择剪枝阶段提供了一个原则性标准。在此基础上，提出了EntropyPrune，这是一种新的基于矩阵熵的标记剪枝框架，它量化了单个视觉标记的信息价值，并剪除了冗余的标记，而不依赖于注意力图。为了实现高效的计算，我们利用了双格拉姆矩阵的谱等价性，降低了熵计算的复杂性，并实现了高达64倍的理论速度提升。

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试中，EntropyPrune在准确性和效率方面都优于最先进的剪枝方法。在LLaVA-1.5-7B上，该方法实现了FLOPs的68.2%的减少，同时保持了96.0%的原有性能。此外，EntropyPrune有效地推广到高分辨率和基于视频的模型，突出了其在实际MLLM加速中的强大鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: EntropyPrune是一种基于矩阵熵的标记剪枝框架，通过识别“熵坍缩层”和利用双格拉姆矩阵的谱等价性，实现了对MLLMs的加速推理，同时保持了较高的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) incur substantial inference cost due to the processing of hundreds of visual tokens per image. Although token pruning has proven effective for accelerating inference, determining when and where to prune remains largely heuristic. Existing approaches typically rely on static, empirically selected layers, which limit interpretability and transferability across models. In this work, we introduce a matrix-entropy perspective and identify an "Entropy Collapse Layer" (ECL), where the information content of visual representations exhibits a sharp and consistent drop, which provides a principled criterion for selecting the pruning stage. Building on this observation, we propose EntropyPrune, a novel matrix-entropy-guided token pruning framework that quantifies the information value of individual visual tokens and prunes redundant ones without relying on attention maps. Moreover, to enable efficient computation, we exploit the spectral equivalence of dual Gram matrices, reducing the complexity of entropy computation and yielding up to a 64x theoretical speedup. Extensive experiments on diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that EntropyPrune consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in both accuracy and efficiency. On LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method achieves a 68.2% reduction in FLOPs while preserving 96.0% of the original performance. Furthermore, EntropyPrune generalizes effectively to high-resolution and video-based models, highlighting the strong robustness and scalability in practical MLLM acceleration. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/YahongWang1/EntropyPrune.

Abstract: Freight vehicles approaching signalized intersections require reliable detection and motion estimation to support infrastructure-based Freight Signal Priority (FSP). Accurate and timely perception of vehicle type, position, and speed is essential for enabling effective priority control strategies. This paper presents the design, deployment, and evaluation of an infrastructure-based multi-modal freight vehicle detection system integrating LiDAR and camera sensors. A hybrid sensing architecture is adopted, consisting of an intersection-mounted subsystem and a midblock subsystem, connected via wireless communication for synchronized data transmission. The perception pipeline incorporates both clustering-based and deep learning-based detection methods with Kalman filter tracking to achieve stable real-time performance. LiDAR measurements are registered into geodetic reference frames to support lane-level localization and consistent vehicle tracking. Field evaluations demonstrate that the system can reliably monitor freight vehicle movements at high spatio-temporal resolution. The design and deployment provide practical insights for developing infrastructure-based sensing systems to support FSP applications.

Conclusion: EA-Swin是一个可扩展且稳健的视频检测解决方案，显著提高了检测准确率。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation video generators such as Sora2, Veo3, and other commercial systems have produced highly realistic synthetic videos, exposing the limitations of existing detection methods that rely on shallow embedding trajectories, image-based adaptation, or computationally heavy MLLMs. We propose EA-Swin, an Embedding-Agnostic Swin Transformer that models spatiotemporal dependencies directly on pretrained video embeddings via a factorized windowed attention design, making it compatible with generic ViT-style patch-based encoders. Alongside the model, we construct the EA-Video dataset, a benchmark dataset comprising 130K videos that integrates newly collected samples with curated existing datasets, covering diverse commercial and open-source generators and including unseen-generator splits for rigorous cross-distribution evaluation. Extensive experiments show that EA-Swin achieves 0.97-0.99 accuracy across major generators, outperforming prior SoTA methods (typically 0.8-0.9) by a margin of 5-20%, while maintaining strong generalization to unseen distributions, establishing a scalable and robust solution for modern AI-generated video detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测抓取点对于微创手术中的自主组织操作至关重要，特别是在像结直肠癌干预这样的复杂和可变程序中。由于它们的复杂性和持续时间长，结直肠癌手术在当前研究中没有得到充分体现。同时，由于重复的组织操作，它们构成了一个特别有趣的的学习环境，使它们成为自主、基于机器学习的支持的切入点。

Method: 引入了附件锚点，这是一种结构化的表示，它编码了结直肠癌手术中组织与其解剖附着物之间的局部几何和机械关系。这种表示通过将手术场景规范化到一致的本地参考系来降低抓取点预测的不确定性。在基于机器学习的抓取框架中，通过腹腔镜图像预测附件锚点并将其纳入。

Result: 在90例结直肠癌手术的数据集上进行的实验表明，与仅基于图像的基线相比，附件锚点提高了抓取点预测。在未见过的程序和手术医生的情况下，这些结果特别强劲。这些结果表明，附件锚点是学习型结直肠癌手术中基于学习的组织操作的有效中间表示。

Conclusion: 附件锚点是一种有效的中间表示，可以提高结直肠癌手术中基于机器学习的抓取点预测。

Abstract: Accurate grasping point prediction is a key challenge for autonomous tissue manipulation in minimally invasive surgery, particularly in complex and variable procedures such as colorectal interventions. Due to their complexity and prolonged duration, colorectal procedures have been underrepresented in current research. At the same time, they pose a particularly interesting learning environment due to repetitive tissue manipulation, making them a promising entry point for autonomous, machine learning-driven support. Therefore, in this work, we introduce attachment anchors, a structured representation that encodes the local geometric and mechanical relationships between tissue and its anatomical attachments in colorectal surgery. This representation reduces uncertainty in grasping point prediction by normalizing surgical scenes into a consistent local reference frame. We demonstrate that attachment anchors can be predicted from laparoscopic images and incorporated into a grasping framework based on machine learning. Experiments on a dataset of 90 colorectal surgeries demonstrate that attachment anchors improve grasping point prediction compared to image-only baselines. There are particularly strong gains in out-of-distribution settings, including unseen procedures and operating surgeons. These results suggest that attachment anchors are an effective intermediate representation for learning-based tissue manipulation in colorectal surgery.

Result: Polaffini在结构对齐方面优于现有方法，并为后续的非线性配准提供了更好的初始化。

Conclusion: Polaffini是一种快速、鲁棒且准确的配准框架，特别适合集成到医学图像处理流程中。

Abstract: In this work we present Polaffini, a robust and versatile framework for anatomically grounded registration. Medical image registration is dominated by intensity-based registration methods that rely on surrogate measures of alignment quality. In contrast, feature-based approaches that operate by identifying explicit anatomical correspondences, while more desirable in theory, have largely fallen out of favor due to the challenges of reliably extracting features. However, such challenges are now significantly overcome thanks to recent advances in deep learning, which provide pre-trained segmentation models capable of instantly delivering reliable, fine-grained anatomical delineations. We aim to demonstrate that these advances can be leveraged to create new anatomically-grounded image registration algorithms. To this end, we propose Polaffini, which obtains, from these segmented regions, anatomically grounded feature points with 1-to-1 correspondence in a particularly simple way: extracting their centroids. These enable efficient global and local affine matching via closed-form solutions. Those are used to produce an overall transformation ranging from affine to polyaffine with tunable smoothness. Polyaffine transformations can have many more degrees of freedom than affine ones allowing for finer alignment, and their embedding in the log-Euclidean framework ensures diffeomorphic properties. Polaffini has applications both for standalone registration and as pre-alignment for subsequent non-linear registration, and we evaluate it against popular intensity-based registration techniques. Results demonstrate that Polaffini outperforms competing methods in terms of structural alignment and provides improved initialisation for downstream non-linear registration. Polaffini is fast, robust, and accurate, making it particularly well-suited for integration into medical image processing pipelines.

Abstract: Monitoring tree crop expansion is vital for zero-deforestation policies like the European Union's Regulation on Deforestation-free Products (EUDR). However, these efforts are hindered by a lack of highresolution data distinguishing diverse agricultural systems from forests. Here, we present the first 10m-resolution tree crop map for South America, generated using a multi-modal, spatio-temporal deep learning model trained on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery time series. The map identifies approximately 11 million hectares of tree crops, 23% of which is linked to 2000-2020 forest cover loss. Critically, our analysis reveals that existing regulatory maps supporting the EUDR often classify established agriculture, particularly smallholder agroforestry, as "forest". This discrepancy risks false deforestation alerts and unfair penalties for small-scale farmers. Our work mitigates this risk by providing a high-resolution baseline, supporting conservation policies that are effective, inclusive, and equitable.

Conclusion: DRetHTR通过使用RetNet架构实现了与Transformer相当的手写文本识别准确性，同时显著提高了解码速度和内存效率。

Abstract: State-of-the-art handwritten text recognition (HTR) systems commonly use Transformers, whose growing key-value (KV) cache makes decoding slow and memory-intensive. We introduce DRetHTR, a decoder-only model built on Retentive Networks (RetNet). Compared to an equally sized decoder-only Transformer baseline, DRetHTR delivers 1.6-1.9x faster inference with 38-42% less memory usage, without loss of accuracy. By replacing softmax attention with softmax-free retention and injecting multi-scale sequential priors, DRetHTR avoids a growing KV cache: decoding is linear in output length in both time and memory. To recover the local-to-global inductive bias of attention, we propose layer-wise gamma scaling, which progressively enlarges the effective retention horizon in deeper layers. This encourages early layers to model short-range dependencies and later layers to capture broader context, mitigating the flexibility gap introduced by removing softmax. Consequently, DRetHTR achieves best reported test character error rates of 2.26% (IAM-A, en), 1.81% (RIMES, fr), and 3.46% (Bentham, en), and is competitive on READ-2016 (de) with 4.21%. This demonstrates that decoder-only RetNet enables Transformer-level HTR accuracy with substantially improved decoding speed and memory efficiency.

Conclusion: SpectralGCD是一种高效且准确的多模态分类方法，在图像分类任务中具有潜在的应用价值。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify novel categories in unlabeled data while leveraging a small labeled subset of known classes. Training a parametric classifier solely on image features often leads to overfitting to old classes, and recent multimodal approaches improve performance by incorporating textual information. However, they treat modalities independently and incur high computational cost. We propose SpectralGCD, an efficient and effective multimodal approach to GCD that uses CLIP cross-modal image-concept similarities as a unified cross-modal representation. Each image is expressed as a mixture over semantic concepts from a large task-agnostic dictionary, which anchors learning to explicit semantics and reduces reliance on spurious visual cues. To maintain the semantic quality of representations learned by an efficient student, we introduce Spectral Filtering which exploits a cross-modal covariance matrix over the softmaxed similarities measured by a strong teacher model to automatically retain only relevant concepts from the dictionary. Forward and reverse knowledge distillation from the same teacher ensures that the cross-modal representations of the student remain both semantically sufficient and well-aligned. Across six benchmarks, SpectralGCD delivers accuracy comparable to or significantly superior to state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the computational cost. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/miccunifi/SpectralGCD.

TL;DR: EAGLE：一种无需微调的框架，通过专家增强注意力引导，显著提高MLLMs的工业异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测对智能制造至关重要，但许多深度学习方法仅产生二元决策并提供有限的语义解释。多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）可以生成细粒度、基于语言的分析，但现有方法通常需要昂贵的微调，并且与轻量级专业检测器相比，并不一致地提高异常检测的准确性。

Method: 提出专家增强注意力引导（EAGLE），这是一种无需微调的框架，它将专家模型的输出集成到MLLMs中，以指导MLLMs进行准确检测和可解释的异常描述。通过检查MLLMs对中间层中异常图像区域的注意力分布，进一步研究了EAGLE如何影响MLLMs的内部结构。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA上的实验表明，EAGLE在不进行任何参数更新的情况下，提高了多个MLLMs的异常检测性能，其结果与基于微调的方法相当。

Conclusion: EAGLE是一种有效的工业异常检测方法，可以显著提高MLLMs的异常检测性能，同时保持可解释性。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is important for smart manufacturing, but many deep learning approaches produce only binary decisions and provide limited semantic explanations. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can potentially generate fine-grained, language-based analyses, yet existing methods often require costly fine-tuning and do not consistently improve anomaly detection accuracy compared to lightweight specialist detectors. We propose expert-augmented attention guidance for industrial anomaly detection in MLLMs (EAGLE), a tuning-free framework that integrates outputs from expert model to guide MLLMs toward both accurate detection and interpretable anomaly descriptions. We further study how EAGLE affects MLLMs internals by examining the attention distribution of MLLMs to the anomalous image regions in the intermediate layers. We observe that successful anomaly detection is associated with increased attention concentration on anomalous regions, and EAGLE tends to encourage this alignment. Experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA show that EAGLE improves anomaly detection performance across multiple MLLMs without any parameter updates, achieving results comparable to fine-tuning based methods.

Conclusion: Local-EndoGS为处理具有较大相机运动的单目内窥镜序列提供了一种有效的方法。

Abstract: Reconstructing deformable surgical scenes from endoscopic videos is challenging and clinically important. Recent state-of-the-art methods based on implicit neural representations or 3D Gaussian splatting have made notable progress. However, most are designed for deformable scenes with fixed endoscope viewpoints and rely on stereo depth priors or accurate structure-from-motion for initialization and optimization, limiting their ability to handle monocular sequences with large camera motion in real clinical settings. To address this, we propose Local-EndoGS, a high-quality 4D reconstruction framework for monocular endoscopic sequences with arbitrary camera motion. Local-EndoGS introduces a progressive, window-based global representation that allocates local deformable scene models to each observed window, enabling scalability to long sequences with substantial motion. To overcome unreliable initialization without stereo depth or accurate structure-from-motion, we design a coarse-to-fine strategy integrating multi-view geometry, cross-window information, and monocular depth priors, providing a robust foundation for optimization. We further incorporate long-range 2D pixel trajectory constraints and physical motion priors to improve deformation plausibility. Experiments on three public endoscopic datasets with deformable scenes and varying camera motions show that Local-EndoGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance quality and geometry. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our key designs. Code will be released upon acceptance at: https://github.com/IRMVLab/Local-EndoGS.

Result: Improved characterization of two-dimensional quantum materials, reduced dependence on expert annotation, enhanced model robustness and discriminative ability

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenges in characterizing two-dimensional quantum materials

Abstract: Characterizing two-dimensional quantum materials from optical microscopy images is challenging due to the subtle layer-dependent contrast, limited labeled data, and significant variation across laboratories and imaging setups. Existing vision models struggle in this domain since they lack physical priors and cannot generalize to new materials or hardware conditions. This work presents a new physics-aware multimodal framework that addresses these limitations from both the data and model perspectives. We first present Synthia, a physics-based synthetic data generator that simulates realistic optical responses of quantum material flakes under thin-film interference. Synthia produces diverse and high-quality samples, helping reduce the dependence on expert manual annotation. We introduce QMat-Instruct, the first large-scale instruction dataset for quantum materials, comprising multimodal, physics-informed question-answer pairs designed to teach Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to understand the appearance and thickness of flakes. Then, we propose Physics-Aware Instruction Tuning (QuPAINT), a multimodal architecture that incorporates a Physics-Informed Attention module to fuse visual embeddings with optical priors, enabling more robust and discriminative flake representations. Finally, we establish QF-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple materials, substrates, and imaging settings, offering standardized protocols for fair and reproducible evaluation.

Abstract: Image Copy Detection (ICD) aims to identify manipulated content between image pairs through robust feature representation learning. While self-supervised learning (SSL) has advanced ICD systems, existing view-level contrastive methods struggle with sophisticated edits due to insufficient fine-grained correspondence learning. We address this limitation by exploiting the inherent geometric traceability in edited content through two key innovations. First, we propose PixTrace - a pixel coordinate tracking module that maintains explicit spatial mappings across editing transformations. Second, we introduce CopyNCE, a geometrically-guided contrastive loss that regularizes patch affinity using overlap ratios derived from PixTrace's verified mappings. Our method bridges pixel-level traceability with patch-level similarity learning, suppressing supervision noise in SSL training. Extensive experiments demonstrate not only state-of-the-art performance (88.7% uAP / 83.9% RP90 for matcher, 72.6% uAP / 68.4% RP90 for descriptor on DISC21 dataset) but also better interpretability over existing methods.

Abstract: Augmented reality can improve tumor localization in laparoscopic liver surgery. Existing registration pipelines typically depend on organ contours; deformable (non-rigid) alignment is often handled with finite-element (FE) models coupled to dimensionality-reduction or machine-learning components. We integrate laparoscopic depth maps with a foundation pose estimator for camera-liver pose estimation and replace FE-based deformation with non-rigid iterative closest point (NICP) to lower engineering/modeling complexity and expertise requirements. On real patient data, the depth-augmented foundation pose approach achieved 9.91 mm mean registration error in 3 cases. Combined rigid-NICP registration outperformed rigid-only registration, demonstrating NICP as an efficient substitute for finite-element deformable models. This pipeline achieves clinically relevant accuracy while offering a lightweight, engineering-friendly alternative to FE-based deformation.

Motivation: 医学视觉语言模型在医学影像识别中的可靠性受到领域偏移的影响，而分割一致预测在少量样本和不平衡数据下的效率低且不平衡。

Method: 提出LATA方法，通过图像-图像k-NN图平滑零样本概率，并引入失败感知一致分数，以改善预测集效率和类别平衡。

Result: 在三个医学视觉语言模型和九个下游任务上，LATA方法降低了集合大小和CCV，同时保持了目标覆盖范围，优于之前的基线方法，并缩小了与使用标签方法的差距。

Conclusion: LATA方法能够提高医学视觉语言模型的可靠性和预测性能。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) are strong zero-shot recognizers for medical imaging, but their reliability under domain shift hinges on calibrated uncertainty with guarantees. Split conformal prediction (SCP) offers finite-sample coverage, yet prediction sets often become large (low efficiency) and class-wise coverage unbalanced-high class-conditioned coverage gap (CCV), especially in few-shot, imbalanced regimes; moreover, naively adapting to calibration labels breaks exchangeability and voids guarantees. We propose \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} (Laplacian-Assisted Transductive Adaptation), a \textit{training- and label-free} refinement that operates on the joint calibration and test pool by smoothing zero-shot probabilities over an image-image k-NN graph using a small number of CCCP mean-field updates, preserving SCP validity via a deterministic transform. We further introduce a \textit{failure-aware} conformal score that plugs into the vision-language uncertainty (ViLU) framework, providing instance-level difficulty and label plausibility to improve prediction set efficiency and class-wise balance at fixed coverage. \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} is black-box (no VLM updates), compute-light (windowed transduction, no backprop), and includes an optional prior knob that can run strictly label-free or, if desired, in a label-informed variant using calibration marginals once. Across \textbf{three} medical VLMs and \textbf{nine} downstream tasks, \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} consistently reduces set size and CCV while matching or tightening target coverage, outperforming prior transductive baselines and narrowing the gap to label-using methods, while using far less compute. Comprehensive ablations and qualitative analyses show that \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} sharpens zero-shot predictions without compromising exchangeability.

Result: 在RexTime和VidHalluc两个数据集上评估GraphThinker，显示出比先前方法更优越的能力来捕捉对象和事件关系，具有更精确的事件定位，减少了视频推理中的幻觉。

Conclusion: GraphThinker在视频推理中有效减少了幻觉，提高了事件关系和定位的准确性。

Abstract: Video reasoning requires understanding the causal relationships between events in a video. However, such relationships are often implicit and costly to annotate manually. While existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often infer event relations through dense captions or video summaries for video reasoning, such modeling still lacks causal understanding. Without explicit causal structure modeling within and across video events, these models suffer from hallucinations during the video reasoning. In this work, we propose GraphThinker, a reinforcement finetuning-based method that constructs structural event-level scene graphs and enhances visual grounding to jointly reduce hallucinations in video reasoning. Specifically, we first employ an MLLM to construct an event-based video scene graph (EVSG) that explicitly models both intra- and inter-event relations, and incorporate these formed scene graphs into the MLLM as an intermediate thinking process. We also introduce a visual attention reward during reinforcement finetuning, which strengthens video grounding and further mitigates hallucinations. We evaluate GraphThinker on two datasets, RexTime and VidHalluc, where it shows superior ability to capture object and event relations with more precise event localization, reducing hallucinations in video reasoning compared to prior methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像条件生成系统存在两个基本局限性：一是它们通常在自然照片上训练，限制了它们捕捉艺术作品的丰富语义、风格和文化内容的能力；二是大多数系统依赖于图像到文本的转换阶段，使用语言作为语义捷径，简化了条件生成，但阻碍了直接从视觉到音频的学习。

Method: 提出了ArtSound，这是一个包含105,884个艺术品-音乐对的庞大多模态数据集，其中包含双模态标题，通过扩展ArtGraph和Free Music Archive获得。此外，还提出了ArtToMus，这是第一个专门为直接从艺术品生成音乐而设计的框架，它将数字化艺术品映射到音乐，而不需要图像到文本的转换或基于语言的语义监督。该框架将视觉嵌入投影到潜在扩散模型的条件空间中，从而仅通过视觉信息引导音乐合成。

Result: 实验结果表明，ArtToMus生成的音乐在音乐上是一致的，在风格上是一致的，并且反映了源艺术作品的显著视觉线索。尽管绝对对齐分数低于文本条件系统，但ArtToMus实现了具有竞争力的感知质量和有意义的跨模态对应。

Conclusion: 这项工作将直接视觉到音乐生成确立为一个独特且具有挑战性的研究方向，并为多媒体艺术、文化遗产和人工智能辅助创意实践的应用提供了资源。

Abstract: Music generation has advanced markedly through multimodal deep learning, enabling models to synthesize audio from text and, more recently, from images. However, existing image-conditioned systems suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) they are typically trained on natural photographs, limiting their ability to capture the richer semantic, stylistic, and cultural content of artworks; and (ii) most rely on an image-to-text conversion stage, using language as a semantic shortcut that simplifies conditioning but prevents direct visual-to-audio learning. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce ArtSound, a large-scale multimodal dataset of 105,884 artwork-music pairs enriched with dual-modality captions, obtained by extending ArtGraph and the Free Music Archive. We further propose ArtToMus, the first framework explicitly designed for direct artwork-to-music generation, which maps digitized artworks to music without image-to-text translation or language-based semantic supervision. The framework projects visual embeddings into the conditioning space of a latent diffusion model, enabling music synthesis guided solely by visual information. Experimental results show that ArtToMus generates musically coherent and stylistically consistent outputs that reflect salient visual cues of the source artworks. While absolute alignment scores remain lower than those of text-conditioned systems-as expected given the substantially increased difficulty of removing linguistic supervision-ArtToMus achieves competitive perceptual quality and meaningful cross-modal correspondence. This work establishes direct visual-to-music generation as a distinct and challenging research direction, and provides resources that support applications in multimedia art, cultural heritage, and AI-assisted creative practice. Code and dataset will be publicly released upon acceptance.

Abstract: In many real-world settings, such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, or public health, with costly and difficult data collection and dynamic environments, strategically sampling from unobserved regions is essential for efficiently uncovering hidden targets under tight resource constraints. Yet, sparse and biased geospatial ground truth limits the applicability of existing learning-based methods, such as reinforcement learning. To address this, we propose a unified geospatial discovery framework that integrates active learning, online meta-learning, and concept-guided reasoning. Our approach introduces two key innovations built on a shared notion of *concept relevance*, which captures how domain-specific factors influence target presence: a *concept-weighted uncertainty sampling strategy*, where uncertainty is modulated by learned relevance based on readily-available domain-specific concepts (e.g., land cover, source proximity); and a *relevance-aware meta-batch formation strategy* that promotes semantic diversity during online-meta updates, improving generalization in dynamic environments. Our experiments include testing on a real-world dataset of cancer-causing PFAS (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) contamination, showcasing our method's reliability at uncovering targets with limited data and a varying environment.

Motivation: 现有的虚拟试穿方法难以保留服装的细节，特别是在需要准确的人体服装对应关系的未配对设置中。这些方法没有明确强制执行人体服装对齐，并且无法解释对应关系如何在扩散变换器（DiTs）中产生。

Method: 分析DiT架构中的完整3D注意力，并揭示人体服装对应关系在完整3D注意力中依赖于精确的人体服装查询-键匹配。基于这一见解，引入CORAL，这是一个基于DiT的框架，它明确地对齐查询-键匹配与鲁棒的外部对应关系。CORAL集成了两个互补组件：一个对应关系蒸馏损失，它将可靠的匹配与人体服装注意力对齐，以及一个熵最小化损失，它锐化注意力分布。此外，还提出了一个基于VLM的评估协议，以更好地反映人类偏好。

Result: CORAL在基线之上持续改进，增强了全局形状转移和局部细节保留。大量的消融实验验证了我们的设计选择。

Conclusion: CORAL方法有效地提高了虚拟试穿中的人体服装对应准确性，为该领域的研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Existing methods for Virtual Try-On (VTON) often struggle to preserve fine garment details, especially in unpaired settings where accurate person-garment correspondence is required. These methods do not explicitly enforce person-garment alignment and fail to explain how correspondence emerges within Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). In this paper, we first analyze full 3D attention in DiT-based architecture and reveal that the person-garment correspondence critically depends on precise person-garment query-key matching within the full 3D attention. Building on this insight, we then introduce CORrespondence ALignment (CORAL), a DiT-based framework that explicitly aligns query-key matching with robust external correspondences. CORAL integrates two complementary components: a correspondence distillation loss that aligns reliable matches with person-garment attention, and an entropy minimization loss that sharpens the attention distribution. We further propose a VLM-based evaluation protocol to better reflect human preference. CORAL consistently improves over the baseline, enhancing both global shape transfer and local detail preservation. Extensive ablations validate our design choices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户从复杂场景中检索指定对象仍然是一项具有挑战性的任务，尤其是在查询模糊或涉及多个类似对象时。现有的开放词汇检测器以单次方式运行，缺乏根据用户反馈调整预测的能力。

Method: 提出IntRec，一个交互式对象检索框架，该框架根据用户反馈调整预测。核心是一个意图状态（IS），它维护两个正锚点（已确认的线索）和负约束（被拒绝的假设）的记忆集。对比对齐函数通过最大化与正线索的相似度同时惩罚被拒绝的对象来对候选对象进行排序，从而在杂乱的场景中实现细粒度去歧义。

Result: 在LVIS上，IntRec达到35.4 AP，分别比OVMR、CoDet和CAKE高出+2.3、+3.7和+0.5。在具有挑战性的LVIS-Ambiguous基准上，经过一次纠正反馈后，它将性能提高了+7.9 AP，每次交互的额外延迟不到30毫秒。

Conclusion: IntRec在检索精度方面提供了显著改进，而无需额外的监督。

Abstract: Retrieving user-specified objects from complex scenes remains a challenging task, especially when queries are ambiguous or involve multiple similar objects. Existing open-vocabulary detectors operate in a one-shot manner, lacking the ability to refine predictions based on user feedback. To address this, we propose IntRec, an interactive object retrieval framework that refines predictions based on user feedback. At its core is an Intent State (IS) that maintains dual memory sets for positive anchors (confirmed cues) and negative constraints (rejected hypotheses). A contrastive alignment function ranks candidate objects by maximizing similarity to positive cues while penalizing rejected ones, enabling fine-grained disambiguation in cluttered scenes. Our interactive framework provides substantial improvements in retrieval accuracy without additional supervision. On LVIS, IntRec achieves 35.4 AP, outperforming OVMR, CoDet, and CAKE by +2.3, +3.7, and +0.5, respectively. On the challenging LVIS-Ambiguous benchmark, it improves performance by +7.9 AP over its one-shot baseline after a single corrective feedback, with less than 30 ms of added latency per interaction.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) promise to ground language instructions in robot control, yet in practice often fail to faithfully follow language. When presented with instructions that lack strong scene-specific supervision, VLAs suffer from counterfactual failures: they act based on vision shortcuts induced by dataset biases, repeatedly executing well-learned behaviors and selecting objects frequently seen during training regardless of language intent. To systematically study it, we introduce LIBERO-CF, the first counterfactual benchmark for VLAs that evaluates language following capability by assigning alternative instructions under visually plausible LIBERO layouts. Our evaluation reveals that counterfactual failures are prevalent yet underexplored across state-of-the-art VLAs. We propose Counterfactual Action Guidance (CAG), a simple yet effective dual-branch inference scheme that explicitly regularizes language conditioning in VLAs. CAG combines a standard VLA policy with a language-unconditioned Vision-Action (VA) module, enabling counterfactual comparison during action selection. This design reduces reliance on visual shortcuts, improves robustness on under-observed tasks, and requires neither additional demonstrations nor modifications to existing architectures or pretrained models. Extensive experiments demonstrate its plug-and-play integration across diverse VLAs and consistent improvements. For example, on LIBERO-CF, CAG improves $π_{0.5}$ by 9.7% in language following accuracy and 3.6% in task success on under-observed tasks using a training-free strategy, with further gains of 15.5% and 8.5%, respectively, when paired with a VA model. In real-world evaluations, CAG reduces counterfactual failures of 9.4% and improves task success by 17.2% on average.

Conclusion: 参考指导的LLM评估器在非验证域中具有促进LLM后训练的潜力。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown strong effectiveness in reasoning tasks, it cannot be directly applied to non-verifiable domains lacking ground-truth verifiers, such as LLM alignment. In this work, we investigate whether reference-guided LLM-evaluators can bridge this gap by serving as soft "verifiers". First, we design evaluation protocols that enhance LLM-based evaluators for LLM alignment using reference outputs. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that a reference-guided approach substantially improves the accuracy of less capable LLM-judges using references from frontier models; stronger LLM-judges can also be enhanced by high-quality (i.e., human-written) references. Building on these improved judges, we demonstrate the utility of high-quality references in alignment tuning, where LLMs guided with references are used as judges to self-improve. We show that reference-guided self-improvement yields clear gains over both direct SFT on reference outputs and self-improvement with reference-free judges, achieving performance comparable to training with ArmoRM, a strong finetuned reward model. Specifically, our method achieves 73.1% and 58.7% on AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard with Llama-3-8B-Instruct, and 70.0% and 74.1% with Qwen2.5-7B, corresponding to average absolute gains of +20.2 / +17.1 points over SFT distillation and +5.3 / +3.6 points over reference-free self-improvement on AlpacaEval / Arena-Hard. These results highlight the potential of using reference-guided LLM-evaluators to enable effective LLM post-training in non-verifiable domains.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning have enabled the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art across a wide range of tasks, including Question Answering (QA). Despite these advancements, research on LLMs has primarily targeted high-resourced languages (e.g., English), and only recently has attention shifted toward multilingual models. However, these models demonstrate a training data bias towards a small number of popular languages or rely on transfer learning from high- to under-resourced languages; this may lead to a misrepresentation of social, cultural, and historical aspects. To address this challenge, monolingual LLMs have been developed for under-resourced languages; however, their effectiveness remains less studied when compared to multilingual counterparts on language-specific tasks. In this study, we address this research gap in Greek QA by contributing: (i) DemosQA, a novel dataset, which is constructed using social media user questions and community-reviewed answers to better capture the Greek social and cultural zeitgeist; (ii) a memory-efficient LLM evaluation framework adaptable to diverse QA datasets and languages; and (iii) an extensive evaluation of 11 monolingual and multilingual LLMs on 6 human-curated Greek QA datasets using 3 different prompting strategies. We release our code and data to facilitate reproducibility.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种适用于保险领域的LLM微调方法，显著提高了模型在索赔处理中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在保险等受监管和数据敏感领域，大型语言模型（LLM）的应用受到限制。

Method: 利用历史保修索赔数据，提出了一种本地部署的治理感知语言模型组件，该组件从非结构化的索赔叙述中生成结构化的纠正行动建议。使用低秩自适应（LoRA）微调预训练的LLM，将模型范围缩小到索赔处理流程中的初始决策模块，以加快索赔调整者的决策。

Result: 结果表明，特定领域的微调显著优于商业通用和基于提示的LLM，约80%的评估案例与地面真相纠正行动几乎完全匹配。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了理论和实证证据，证明了领域自适应的微调可以将模型输出分布与真实世界的运营数据更紧密地对齐，展示了其在保险应用中的可靠性和可治理性的潜力。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on general-purpose language tasks, their deployment in regulated and data-sensitive domains, including insurance, remains limited. Leveraging millions of historical warranty claims, we propose a locally deployed governance-aware language modeling component that generates structured corrective-action recommendations from unstructured claim narratives. We fine-tune pretrained LLMs using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), scoping the model to an initial decision module within the claim processing pipeline to speed up claim adjusters' decisions. We assess this module using a multi-dimensional evaluation framework that combines automated semantic similarity metrics with human evaluation, enabling a rigorous examination of both practical utility and predictive accuracy. Our results show that domain-specific fine-tuning substantially outperforms commercial general-purpose and prompt-based LLMs, with approximately 80% of the evaluated cases achieving near-identical matches to ground-truth corrective actions. Overall, this study provides both theoretical and empirical evidence to prove that domain-adaptive fine-tuning can align model output distributions more closely with real-world operational data, demonstrating its promise as a reliable and governable building block for insurance applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BanglaSummEval的新框架，用于评估孟加拉语摘要的事实一致性，具有实用性和透明性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估事实一致性对于可靠的文本摘要至关重要，特别是在医疗和新闻等高风险领域。然而，大多数现有的评估指标忽略了孟加拉语，这是一种广泛使用但资源不足的语言，并且通常依赖于参考摘要。

Method: 我们引入了BanglaSummEval，这是一个基于问答、无参考框架，用于评估孟加拉语摘要的事实一致性。该方法通过从源文档和摘要中自动生成的问题和答案来评估事实准确性和内容覆盖。使用单一的多语言指令调整语言模型处理问题生成、问答、候选答案提取和问题重要性加权。为了捕捉超越表面重叠的语义一致性，我们使用BERTScore-Recall进行答案比较。

Result: 在300个来自教育和医学领域的人工编写的摘要上验证了BanglaSummEval，证明了与专家人类判断之间有很强的相关性（皮尔逊相关系数r = 0.694，斯皮尔曼ρ = 0.763）。通过提供可解释的、分步骤的诊断以及可靠的评估分数，BanglaSummEval为低资源语言环境中的事实一致性评估提供了一个实用且透明的解决方案。

Conclusion: BanglaSummEval是一个针对孟加拉语摘要的事实一致性评估的无参考、基于问答的框架，具有实际和透明的特点。

Abstract: Evaluating factual consistency is essential for reliable text summarization, particularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and news. However, most existing evaluation metrics overlook Bangla, a widely spoken yet under-resourced language, and often depend on reference summaries. We introduce BanglaSummEval, a reference-free, question-answering-based framework for evaluating factual consistency in Bangla summarization. The proposed method assesses both factual accuracy and content coverage through automatically generated questions and answers derived from the source document and the summary. A single multilingual instruction-tuned language model handles question generation, question answering, candidate answer extraction, and question importance weighting. This unified design reduces system complexity and computational cost. To capture semantic consistency beyond surface-level overlap, we use BERTScore-Recall for answer comparison. We validate BanglaSummEval on 300 human-written summaries from educational and medical domains, demonstrating strong correlation with expert human judgments (Pearson's $r = 0.694$, Spearman's $ρ= 0.763$). By providing interpretable, step-wise diagnostics alongside reliable evaluation scores, BanglaSummEval offers a practical and transparent solution for factual consistency evaluation in low-resource language settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护并复兴即将灭绝的语言和方言，特别是Mainz方言Meenzerisch。

Method: 构建一个数字词典，包含2,351个Meenzerisch单词及其在标准德语中的含义，用于训练和测试NLP模型。

Result: LLMs在生成方言词定义和方言词生成方面的准确率均低于10%。

Conclusion: 需要更多资源和研究努力来支持德国方言的保护。

Abstract: Meenzerisch, the dialect spoken in the German city of Mainz, is also the traditional language of the Mainz carnival, a yearly celebration well known throughout Germany. However, Meenzerisch is on the verge of dying out-a fate it shares with many other German dialects. Natural language processing (NLP) has the potential to help with the preservation and revival efforts of languages and dialects. However, so far no NLP research has looked at Meenzerisch. This work presents the first research in the field of NLP that is explicitly focused on the dialect of Mainz. We introduce a digital dictionary-an NLP-ready dataset derived from an existing resource (Schramm, 1966)-to support researchers in modeling and benchmarking the language. It contains 2,351 words in the dialect paired with their meanings described in Standard German. We then use this dataset to answer the following research questions: (1) Can state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) generate definitions for dialect words? (2) Can LLMs generate words in Meenzerisch, given their definitions? Our experiments show that LLMs can do neither: the best model for definitions reaches only 6.27% accuracy and the best word generation model's accuracy is 1.51%. We then conduct two additional experiments in order to see if accuracy is improved by few-shot learning and by extracting rules from the training set, which are then passed to the LLM. While those approaches are able to improve the results, accuracy remains below 10%. This highlights that additional resources and an intensification of research efforts focused on German dialects are desperately needed.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Euphemisms substitute socially sensitive expressions, often softening or reframing meaning, and their reliance on cultural and pragmatic context complicates modeling across languages. In this study, we investigate how cross-lingual equivalence influences transfer in multilingual euphemism detection. We categorize Potentially Euphemistic Terms (PETs) in Turkish and English into Overlapping (OPETs) and Non-Overlapping (NOPETs) subsets based on their functional, pragmatic, and semantic alignment. Our findings reveal a transfer asymmetry: semantic overlap is insufficient to guarantee positive transfer, particularly in low-resource Turkish-to-English direction, where performance can degrade even for overlapping euphemisms, and in some cases, improve under NOPET-based training. Differences in label distribution help explain these counterintuitive results. Category-level analysis suggests that transfer may be influenced by domain-specific alignment, though evidence is limited by sparsity.

Abstract: Classical Persian poetry is a historically sustained archive in which affective life is expressed through metaphor, intertextual convention, and rhetorical indirection. These properties make close reading indispensable while limiting reproducible comparison at scale. We present an uncertainty-aware computational framework for poet-level psychological analysis based on large-scale automatic multi-label annotation. Each verse is associated with a set of psychological concepts, per-label confidence scores, and an abstention flag that signals insufficient evidence. We aggregate confidence-weighted evidence into a Poet $\times$ Concept matrix, interpret each poet as a probability distribution over concepts, and quantify poetic individuality as divergence from a corpus baseline using Jensen--Shannon divergence and Kullback--Leibler divergence. To capture relational structure beyond marginals, we build a confidence-weighted co-occurrence graph over concepts and define an Eigenmood embedding through Laplacian spectral decomposition. On a corpus of 61{,}573 verses across 10 poets, 22.2\% of verses are abstained, underscoring the analytical importance of uncertainty. We further report sensitivity analysis under confidence thresholding, selection-bias diagnostics that treat abstention as a category, and a distant-to-close workflow that retrieves verse-level exemplars along Eigenmood axes. The resulting framework supports scalable, auditable digital-humanities analysis while preserving interpretive caution by propagating uncertainty from verse-level evidence to poet-level inference.

Abstract: A growing body of work attempts to evaluate the theory of mind (ToM) abilities of humans and large language models (LLMs) using static, non-interactive question-and-answer benchmarks. However, theoretical work in the field suggests that first-personal interaction is a crucial part of ToM and that such predictive, spectatorial tasks may fail to evaluate it. We address this gap with a novel ToM task that requires an agent to persuade a target to choose one of three policy proposals by strategically revealing information. Success depends on a persuader's sensitivity to a given target's knowledge states (what the target knows about the policies) and motivational states (how much the target values different outcomes). We varied whether these states were Revealed to persuaders or Hidden, in which case persuaders had to inquire about or infer them. In Experiment 1, participants persuaded a bot programmed to make only rational inferences. LLMs excelled in the Revealed condition but performed below chance in the Hidden condition, suggesting difficulty with the multi-step planning required to elicit and use mental state information. Humans performed moderately well in both conditions, indicating an ability to engage such planning. In Experiment 2, where a human target role-played the bot, and in Experiment 3, where we measured whether human targets' real beliefs changed, LLMs outperformed human persuaders across all conditions. These results suggest that effective persuasion can occur without explicit ToM reasoning (e.g., through rhetorical strategies) and that LLMs excel at this form of persuasion. Overall, our results caution against attributing human-like ToM to LLMs while highlighting LLMs' potential to influence people's beliefs and behavior.

Conclusion: 该研究强调了跨语言社交媒体分析中的挑战，并提出了有效的解决方案，为多语言文本分类方法的优化提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Analysing multilingual social media discourse remains a major challenge in natural language processing, particularly when large-scale public debates span across diverse languages. This study investigates how different approaches for cross-lingual text classification can support reliable analysis of global conversations. Using hydrogen energy as a case study, we analyse a decade-long dataset of over nine million tweets in English, Japanese, Hindi, and Korean (2013--2022) for topic discovery. The online keyword-driven data collection results in a significant amount of irrelevant content. We explore four approaches to filter relevant content: (1) translating English annotated data into target languages for building language-specific models for each target language, (2) translating unlabelled data appearing from all languages into English for creating a single model based on English annotations, (3) applying English fine-tuned multilingual transformers directly to each target language data, and (4) a hybrid strategy that combines translated annotations with multilingual training. Each approach is evaluated for its ability to filter hydrogen-related tweets from noisy keyword-based collections. Subsequently, topic modeling is performed to extract dominant themes within the relevant subsets. The results highlight key trade-offs between translation and multilingual approaches, offering actionable insights into optimising cross-lingual pipelines for large-scale social media analysis.

Abstract: While recent Arabic NLP benchmarks focus on scale, they often rely on synthetic or translated data which may benefit from deeper linguistic verification. We introduce ALPS (Arabic Linguistic & Pragmatic Suite), a native, expert-curated diagnostic challenge set probing Deep Semantics and Pragmatics, capabilities that complement specialized large-scale benchmarks. While broad-coverage benchmarks prioritize scale and multi-task coverage, ALPS targets the depth of linguistic understanding through 531 rigorously crafted questions across 15 tasks and 47 subtasks. We developed the dataset with deep expertise in Arabic linguistics, guaranteeing cultural authenticity and eliminating translation artifacts. Evaluating 23 diverse models (commercial, open-source, and Arabic-native) against a single-pass human performance (avg. 84.6% accuracy) and an expert-adjudicated oracle (99.2%), we reveal a critical dissociation: models achieve high fluency but fail on fundamental morpho-syntactic dependencies, with elevated error rates on morpho-syntactic dependencies (36.5% across diacritics-reliant tasks) compared to compositional semantics. While top commercial models (Gemini-3-flash at 94.2%) surpass the average single human, a substantial gap persists between commercial giants and Arabic-native models, with the best Arabic-specific model (Jais-2-70B at 83.6%) approaching but not matching human performance.

Conclusion: BankMathBench是一个可靠的基准，可以评估和推进LLMs在现实银行场景中的数值推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based chatbots are increasingly being adopted in the financial domain, particularly in digital banking, to handle customer inquiries about products such as deposits, savings, and loans. However, these models still exhibit low accuracy in core banking computations-including total payout estimation, comparison of products with varying interest rates, and interest calculation under early repayment conditions. Such tasks require multi-step numerical reasoning and contextual understanding of banking products, yet existing LLMs often make systematic errors-misinterpreting product types, applying conditions incorrectly, or failing basic calculations involving exponents and geometric progressions. However, such errors have rarely been captured by existing benchmarks. Mathematical datasets focus on fundamental math problems, whereas financial benchmarks primarily target financial documents, leaving everyday banking scenarios underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose BankMathBench, a domain-specific dataset that reflects realistic banking tasks. BankMathBench is organized in three levels of difficulty-basic, intermediate, and advanced-corresponding to single-product reasoning, multi-product comparison, and multi-condition scenarios, respectively. When trained on BankMathBench, open-source LLMs exhibited notable improvements in both formula generation and numerical reasoning accuracy, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in enhancing domain-specific reasoning. With tool-augmented fine-tuning, the models achieved average accuracy increases of 57.6%p (basic), 75.1%p (intermediate), and 62.9%p (advanced), representing significant gains over zero-shot baselines. These findings highlight BankMathBench as a reliable benchmark for evaluating and advancing LLMs' numerical reasoning in real-world banking scenarios.

Motivation: 在大型语言模型（LLMs）从独立的聊天界面过渡到多智能体系统和递归评估循环（LLM-as-a-judge）的基础推理层时，检测持久、供应商级别的行为特征对于安全和治理变得至关重要。

Method: 本研究引入了一种新颖的审计框架，该框架利用心理测量测量理论——具体来说是序数不确定性下的潜在特质估计——来量化这些倾向，而不依赖于真实标签。使用强制选择的序数情景和语义正交的诱饵，并通过密码学排列不变性进行管理，研究审计了包括优化偏差、谄媚和现状合法化在内的九个顶级模型。

Result: 研究发现，虽然项目级框架驱动了高方差，但持续的“实验室信号”导致了显著的行为聚类。这些发现表明，在“锁定”的供应商生态系统中，潜在偏差不仅仅是静态错误，而是风险因素，可能会在多层AI架构中创建递归意识形态回音室。

Conclusion: 在多智能体系统和递归评估循环中，持久、供应商级别的行为特征对于安全和治理至关重要。本研究提出的方法可以有效地量化潜在偏差，并揭示了潜在偏差在多层AI架构中可能产生的问题。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from standalone chat interfaces to foundational reasoning layers in multi-agent systems and recursive evaluation loops (LLM-as-a-judge), the detection of durable, provider-level behavioral signatures becomes a critical requirement for safety and governance. Traditional benchmarks measure transient task accuracy but fail to capture stable, latent response policies -- the ``prevailing mindsets'' embedded during training and alignment that outlive individual model versions.
  This paper introduces a novel auditing framework that utilizes psychometric measurement theory -- specifically latent trait estimation under ordinal uncertainty -- to quantify these tendencies without relying on ground-truth labels. Utilizing forced-choice ordinal vignettes masked by semantically orthogonal decoys and governed by cryptographic permutation-invariance, the research audits nine leading models across dimensions including Optimization Bias, Sycophancy, and Status-Quo Legitimization.
  Using Mixed Linear Models (MixedLM) and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) analysis, the research identifies that while item-level framing drives high variance, a persistent ``lab signal'' accounts for significant behavioral clustering. These findings demonstrate that in ``locked-in'' provider ecosystems, latent biases are not merely static errors but compounding variables that risk creating recursive ideological echo chambers in multi-layered AI architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自然语言处理（NLP）中，人类自我报告问卷越来越多地用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs），但这些问卷假设了诚实回答。然而，在评估环境中，LLMs可能会倾向于选择社会期望的答案，从而产生社会期望性回答（SDR）偏差。

Method: 提出了一种心理测量框架来量化并减轻问卷评估LLMs中的SDR。通过在HONEST和FAKE-GOOD指示下进行相同的量表评估，并从IRT估计的潜在分数中计算SDR作为方向校正的标准化效应量。为了减轻SDR，通过约束优化从项目库中选择30个跨领域的成对项目来构建分级强迫选择（GFC）五大人格量表。

Result: 在九个指令调整的LLMs上，使用已知目标配置文件的合成人格进行评估时，Likert风格的问卷显示出一致的SDR，而与期望性匹配的GFC大大降低了SDR，同时基本保留了目标人格特征的恢复。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明了模型依赖的SDR恢复权衡，并促使问卷基准和LLMs审计的SDR意识报告实践。

Abstract: Human self-report questionnaires are increasingly used in NLP to benchmark and audit large language models (LLMs), from persona consistency to safety and bias assessments. Yet these instruments presume honest responding; in evaluative contexts, LLMs can instead gravitate toward socially preferred answers-a form of socially desirable responding (SDR)-biasing questionnaire-derived scores and downstream conclusions. We propose a psychometric framework to quantify and mitigate SDR in questionnaire-based evaluation of LLMs. To quantify SDR, the same inventory is administered under HONEST versus FAKE-GOOD instructions, and SDR is computed as a direction-corrected standardized effect size from item response theory (IRT)-estimated latent scores. This enables comparisons across constructs and response formats, as well as against human instructed-faking benchmarks. For mitigation, we construct a graded forced-choice (GFC) Big Five inventory by selecting 30 cross-domain pairs from an item pool via constrained optimization to match desirability. Across nine instruction-tuned LLMs evaluated on synthetic personas with known target profiles, Likert-style questionnaires show consistently large SDR, whereas desirability-matched GFC substantially attenuates SDR while largely preserving the recovery of the intended persona profiles. These results highlight a model-dependent SDR-recovery trade-off and motivate SDR-aware reporting practices for questionnaire-based benchmarking and auditing of LLMs.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have become pivotal to content safety, current evaluation paradigms primarily focus on detecting explicit harms (e.g., violence or hate speech), neglecting the subtler value dimensions conveyed in digital content. To bridge this gap, we introduce X-Value, a novel Cross-lingual Values Assessment Benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to assess deep-level values of content from a global perspective. X-Value consists of more than 5,000 QA pairs across 18 languages, systematically organized into 7 core domains grounded in Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values and categorized into easy and hard levels for discriminative evaluation. We further propose a unique two-stage annotation framework that first identifies whether an issue falls under global consensus (e.g., human rights) or pluralism (e.g., religion), and subsequently conducts a multi-party evaluation of the latent values embedded within the content. Systematic evaluations on X-Value reveal that current SOTA LLMs exhibit deficiencies in cross-lingual values assessment ($Acc < 77\%$), with significant performance disparities across different languages ($ΔAcc > 20\%$). This work highlights the urgent need to improve the nuanced, values-aware content assessment capability of LLMs. Our X-Value is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Whitolf/X-Value.

Abstract: Modern neural translation models based on the Transformer architecture are known for their high performance, particularly when trained on high-resource datasets. A standard next-token prediction training strategy, while widely adopted in practice, may lead to overlooked artifacts such as representation collapse. Previous works have shown that this problem is especially pronounced in the representation of the deeper Transformer layers, where it often fails to efficiently utilize the geometric space. Representation collapse is even more evident in end-to-end training of continuous-output neural machine translation, where the trivial solution would be to set all vectors to the same value. In this work, we analyze the dynamics of representation collapse at different levels of discrete and continuous NMT transformers throughout training. We incorporate an existing regularization method based on angular dispersion and demonstrate empirically that it not only mitigates collapse but also improves translation quality. Furthermore, we show that quantized models exhibit similar collapse behavior and that the benefits of regularization are preserved even after quantization.

Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLMs）对输入提示的浅层变化的敏感性，其可靠性越来越受到质疑。

Method: 我们采用了两种基于语言学的管道来生成意义保持的变化：一种执行同义词替换进行词汇变化，另一种使用依存句法分析来确定适用的句法变换。

Result: 结果显示，词汇扰动在几乎所有模型和任务中一致地引起显著的性能下降，而句法扰动具有更异质的影响，偶尔会改善结果。两种扰动类型都会使复杂任务的模型排行榜不稳定。此外，模型的鲁棒性并没有随着模型规模的增加而一致地提高，揭示了任务依赖性。总的来说，这些发现表明，LLMs更依赖于表面层次的词汇模式，而不是抽象的语言能力，强调了鲁棒性测试作为LLM评估标准组件的必要性。

Conclusion: LLMs更依赖于表面层次的词汇模式，而不是抽象的语言能力，强调了鲁棒性测试作为LLM评估标准组件的必要性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has established standardized evaluation benchmarks as the primary instrument for model comparison. Yet, their reliability is increasingly questioned due to sensitivity to shallow variations in input prompts. This paper examines how controlled, truth-conditionally equivalent lexical and syntactic perturbations affect the absolute performance and relative ranking of 23 contemporary LLMs across three benchmarks: MMLU, SQuAD, and AMEGA. We employ two linguistically principled pipelines to generate meaning-preserving variations: one performing synonym substitution for lexical changes, and another using dependency parsing to determine applicable syntactic transformations. Results show that lexical perturbations consistently induce substantial, statistically significant performance degradation across nearly all models and tasks, while syntactic perturbations have more heterogeneous effects, occasionally improving results. Both perturbation types destabilize model leaderboards on complex tasks. Furthermore, model robustness did not consistently scale with model size, revealing strong task dependence. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs rely more on surface-level lexical patterns than on abstract linguistic competence, underscoring the need for robustness testing as a standard component of LLM evaluation.

Motivation: 长尾问答对大型语言模型（LLMs）提出了重大挑战，因为它们获取和准确回忆罕见知识的能力有限。

Method: 提出了一种名为RPDR的新数据增强框架，该框架通过选择高质量的易于学习训练数据来增强密集检索器。

Result: 在两个长尾检索基准PopQA和EntityQuestion上对RPDR进行了评估，表明与现有的检索器（如BM25和Contriver）相比，RPDR在极端长尾类别上取得了显著的改进。

Conclusion: RPDR通过详细的人类分析识别了其优势和局限性，并提出了一个动态路由机制来动态地将查询路由到专门的检索模块，以进一步提高检索性能。

Abstract: Long-tail question answering presents significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to their limited ability to acquire and accurately recall less common knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have shown great promise in mitigating this limitation by integrating external retrieval mechanisms. However, dense retrieval models often face the same difficulties when generalizing to rare or niche knowledge. In this study, we introduce RPDR, a novel data augmentation framework that selects high-quality easy-to-learn training data, to enhance dense retrievers. Our approach is built around three core components: synthetic data generation, data selection with Round-Trip prediction to identify easy-to-learn instances, and retriever training with these instances. We evaluate RPDR on two long-tail retrieval benchmarks, PopQA and EntityQuestion, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing retrievers like BM25 and Contriver, especially on extremely long-tail categories. We identify the strengths and limitations of RPDR through detailed human analysis and propose a dynamic routing mechanism to dynamically route queries to specialized retrieval modules to further improve retrieval performance.

Motivation: 研究学生在不确定正确答案时选择答案的策略。

Method: 使用计算方法评估选择题选项的认知可获得性，并通过大型语料库中的概念普及度进行操作化。

Result: 正确答案的可用性比错误选项高，选择最易获得的选项比随机猜测基准得分高13.5%至32.9%。LLM生成的选择题选项与专家创建的选项具有相似的可用性模式。

Conclusion: 在计算建模学生行为时，应考虑可用性。

Abstract: When students are unsure of the correct answer to a multiple-choice question (MCQ), guessing is common practice. The availability heuristic, proposed by A. Tversky and D. Kahneman in 1973, suggests that the ease with which relevant instances come to mind, typically operationalised by the mere frequency of exposure, can offer a mental shortcut for problems in which the test-taker does not know the exact answer. Is simply choosing the option that comes most readily to mind a good strategy for answering MCQs? We propose a computational method of assessing the cognitive availability of MCQ options operationalised by concepts' prevalence in large corpora. The key finding, across three large question sets, is that correct answers, independently of the question stem, are significantly more available than incorrect MCQ options. Specifically, using Wikipedia as the retrieval corpus, we find that always selecting the most available option leads to scores 13.5% to 32.9% above the random-guess baseline. We further find that LLM-generated MCQ options show similar patterns of availability compared to expert-created options, despite the LLMs' frequentist nature and their training on large collections of textual data. Our findings suggest that availability should be considered in current and future work when computationally modelling student behaviour.

Result: 重新标注NewsWCL50和ECB+数据集，结果支持平衡和语篇意识的新闻领域CDCR研究

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的CDCR标注方案，提高了数据集的多样性分析能力，有助于新闻领域的CDCR研究

Abstract: Cross-document coreference resolution (CDCR) identifies and links mentions of the same entities and events across related documents, enabling content analysis that aggregates information at the level of discourse participants. However, existing datasets primarily focus on event resolution and employ a narrow definition of coreference, which limits their effectiveness in analyzing diverse and polarized news coverage where wording varies widely. This paper proposes a revised CDCR annotation scheme of the NewsWCL50 dataset, treating coreference chains as discourse elements (DEs) and conceptual units of analysis. The approach accommodates both identity and near-identity relations, e.g., by linking "the caravan" - "asylum seekers" - "those contemplating illegal entry", allowing models to capture lexical diversity and framing variation in media discourse, while maintaining the fine-grained annotation of DEs. We reannotate the NewsWCL50 and a subset of ECB+ using a unified codebook and evaluate the new datasets through lexical diversity metrics and a same-head-lemma baseline. The results show that the reannotated datasets align closely, falling between the original ECB+ and NewsWCL50, thereby supporting balanced and discourse-aware CDCR research in the news domain.

Motivation: 评估极低资源语言（ELRL）场景中的机器翻译（MT）质量面临独特挑战，因为广泛使用的指标如BLEU在高资源环境中有效，但在数据稀缺的背景下往往无法准确反映质量。

Method: 对BLEU（基于n-gram的指标）和ChrF++（基于字符的指标）在ELRL环境中的MT评估进行了比较分析。考察了每个指标对翻译错误（包括幻觉、重复、源文本复制和变音符号变化）的响应，涉及三个ELRL：马加希、博杰普里和恰蒂斯加尔希，重点关注大型语言模型（LLMs）和神经机器翻译（NMT）系统的输出。

Result: 研究发现，尽管BLEU的绝对分数较低，但它提供了互补的词汇精确度见解，从而提高了可解释性。

Conclusion: 在ELRL环境中，BLEU和ChrF++各有优势，可以互补使用，以更准确地评估MT质量。

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality in extremely low-resource language (ELRL) scenarios poses unique challenges, as widely used metrics such as BLEU, effective in high-resource settings, often misrepresent quality in data-scarce contexts. This work presents a comparative analysis of BLEU, an n-gram-based metric, and ChrF++, a character-based metric, for MT evaluation in ELRL settings. We examine how each metric responds to translation artifacts, including hallucinations, repetition, source-text copying, and diacritic (\textit{matra}) variations across three ELRLs: Magahi, Bhojpuri, and Chhattisgarhi, with a focus on outputs from large language models (LLMs) and neural MT (NMT) systems. While recent work often relies solely on ChrF++, our findings show that BLEU, despite its lower absolute scores, provides complementary lexical-precision insights that improve interpretability.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification has emerged as an effective approach to closed-book hallucination detection for LLMs, but existing methods are largely designed for short-form outputs and do not generalize well to long-form generation. We introduce a taxonomy for fine-grained uncertainty quantification in long-form LLM outputs that distinguishes methods by design choices at three stages: response decomposition, unit-level scoring, and response-level aggregation. We formalize several families of consistency-based black-box scorers, providing generalizations and extensions of existing methods. In our experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets, we find 1) claim-response entailment consistently performs better or on par with more complex claim-level scorers, 2) claim-level scoring generally yields better results than sentence-level scoring, and 3) uncertainty-aware decoding is highly effective for improving the factuality of long-form outputs. Our framework clarifies relationships between prior methods, enables apples-to-apples comparisons, and provides practical guidance for selecting components for fine-grained UQ.

Abstract: Evaluating the strategic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires moving beyond static benchmarks to dynamic, multi-turn interactions. We introduce AIDG (Adversarial Information Deduction Game), a game-theoretic framework that probes the asymmetry between information extraction (active deduction) and information containment (state maintenance) in dialogue. We propose two complementary tasks: AIDG-I, measuring pragmatic strategy in social deduction, and AIDG-II, measuring constraint satisfaction in a structured "20 Questions" setting. Across 439 games with six frontier LLMs, we observe a clear capability asymmetry: models perform substantially better at containment than deduction, with a 350 ELO advantage on defense;(Cohen's d = 5.47). We identify two bottlenecks driving this gap: (1) Information Dynamics, where confirmation strategies are 7.75x more effective than blind deduction (p < 0.00001), and (2) Constraint Adherence, where instruction-following degrades under conversational load, accounting for 41.3% of deductive failures. These findings suggest that while LLMs excel at local defensive coherence, they struggle with the global state tracking required for strategic inquiry.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在回答知识性问题时推理能力的方法

Method: 提出了一种新的评估协议，用无序标签替换每个问题的标签，并提示LLM使用整个答案

Result: 提高了LLMs的鲁棒性，降低了不同答案排列的标准差，减少了平均准确率的方差

Conclusion: 该协议对减少评估偏差和提高LLMs的鲁棒性具有重要作用

Abstract: Multiple-choice question (MCQ) benchmarks have been a standard evaluation practice for measuring LLMs' ability to reason and answer knowledge-based questions. Through a synthetic NonsenseQA benchmark, we observe that different LLMs exhibit varying degrees of label-position-few-shot-prompt bias, where the model either uses the answer position, the label in front of the answer, the distributions of correct answers present in the few-shot prompt, or a combination of all to answer each MCQ question. We propose a simple bias-reduced evaluation protocol that replaces the labels of each question with uniform, unordered labels and prompts the LLM to use the whole answer presented. With a simple sentence similarity model, we demonstrate improved robustness and lower standard deviation between different permutations of answers with a minimal drop in LLM's performance, exposing the LLM's capabilities under reduced evaluation artifacts, without any help from the prompt examples or the option labels. Across multiple benchmarks and models, this protocol substantially improves the robustness to answer permutations, reducing mean accuracy variance $3\times$ with only a minimal decrease in the mean model's performance. Through ablation studies on various embedding models and similarity functions, we show that the method is more robust than the standard ones.

TL;DR: EUDS框架有效降低了计算成本，提高了训练效率，适用于资源受限场景下的语言模型微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型对计算资源和数据资源的需求不断增加，数据选择技术可以有效地减少用于微调语言模型所需的训练数据量。然而，其有效性与计算资源密切相关，通常需要较高的计算预算。在实践微调场景中，由于资源限制，我们需要系统地揭示数据选择与所选数据不确定性之间的关系。尽管大型语言模型在语言理解和生成方面表现出卓越的能力，提供了缓解数据稀缺性的新方法，但评估数据可用性仍然是一个具有挑战性的任务。这使得高效的数据选择变得必不可少。

Method: 提出了一种基于熵的无监督数据选择（EUDS）框架。EUDS建立了一种计算高效的数据过滤机制。通过在情感分析（SA）、主题分类（Topic-CLS）和问答（Q&A）任务上的实验验证其有效性。

Result: EUDS显著降低了计算成本，并提高了在较少数据需求下的训练时间效率。这为计算受限场景下语言模型的效率微调提供了一种创新解决方案。

Conclusion: EUDS框架在数据选择和不确定性估计方面具有显著优势，为资源受限环境下的语言模型微调提供了有效的方法。

Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) increasingly require two critical resources: computational resources and data resources. Data selection techniques can effectively reduce the amount of training data required for fine-tuning LMs. However, their effectiveness is closely related to computational resources, which always require a high compute budget. Owing to the resource limitations in practical fine-tuning scenario, we systematically reveal the relationship between data selection and uncertainty estimation of selected data. Although large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation, which provide new ways to alleviate data scarcity, evaluating data usability remains a challenging task. This makes efficient data selection indispensable. To mitigate these issues, we propose Entropy-Based Unsupervised Data Selection (EUDS) framework. Empirical experiments on sentiment analysis (SA), topic classification (Topic-CLS), and question answering (Q&A) tasks validate its effectiveness. EUDS establishes a computationally efficient data-filtering mechanism. Theoretical analysis and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach. EUDS significantly reduces computational costs and improves training time efficiency with less data requirement. This provides an innovative solution for the efficient fine-tuning of LMs in the compute-constrained scenarios.

Method: PEACE 2.0是一个新颖的工具，除了分析和解释为什么一条信息被认为是仇恨性的或不仇恨性的之外，还能生成对该信息的回应。它利用检索增强生成（RAG）管道，将仇恨言论的解释与证据和事实相结合，自动生成基于证据的反言论，并探索反言论回复的特征。

Abstract: The increasing volume of hate speech on online platforms poses significant societal challenges. While the Natural Language Processing community has developed effective methods to automatically detect the presence of hate speech, responses to it, called counter-speech, are still an open challenge. We present PEACE 2.0, a novel tool that, besides analysing and explaining why a message is considered hateful or not, also generates a response to it. More specifically, PEACE 2.0 has three main new functionalities: leveraging a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline i) to ground HS explanations into evidence and facts, ii) to automatically generate evidence-grounded counter-speech, and iii) exploring the characteristics of counter-speech replies. By integrating these capabilities, PEACE 2.0 enables in-depth analysis and response generation for both explicit and implicit hateful messages.

Abstract: The core theme of bidirectional alignment is ensuring that AI systems accurately understand human intent and that humans can trust AI behavior. However, this loop fractures significantly across language barriers. Our research addresses Cross-Lingual Sentiment Misalignment between Bengali and English by benchmarking four transformer architectures. We reveal severe safety and representational failures in current alignment paradigms. We demonstrate that compressed model (mDistilBERT) exhibits 28.7% "Sentiment Inversion Rate," fundamentally misinterpreting positive user intent as negative (or vice versa). Furthermore, we identify systemic nuances affecting human-AI trust, including "Asymmetric Empathy" where some models systematically dampen and others amplify the affective weight of Bengali text relative to its English counterpart. Finally, we reveal a "Modern Bias" in the regional model (IndicBERT), which shows a 57% increase in alignment error when processing formal (Sadhu) Bengali. We argue that equitable human-AI co-evolution requires pluralistic, culturally grounded alignment that respects language and dialectal diversity over universal compression, which fails to preserve the emotional fidelity required for reciprocal human-AI trust. We recommend that alignment benchmarks incorporate "Affective Stability" metrics that explicitly penalize polarity inversions in low-resource and dialectal contexts.

Motivation: 为了解决大型语言模型在医疗自然语言处理任务中的计算需求问题，研究者们探索了小型语言模型在保持竞争力准确率的同时能否有效执行医疗任务。

Method: 研究者们对Llama-3、Gemma-3和Qwen3三个主要家族的模型进行了评估，包括20个临床NLP任务，如命名实体识别、关系抽取、病例报告表填写、问答和论点挖掘。他们系统地比较了多种适应策略，包括推理时的少量样本提示、约束解码和训练时的监督微调、持续预训练。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) consistently excel in diverse medical Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, yet their substantial computational requirements often limit deployment in real-world healthcare settings. In this work, we investigate whether "small" LLMs (around one billion parameters) can effectively perform medical tasks while maintaining competitive accuracy. We evaluate models from three major families-Llama-3, Gemma-3, and Qwen3-across 20 clinical NLP tasks among Named Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction, Case Report Form Filling, Question Answering, and Argument Mining. We systematically compare a range of adaptation strategies, both at inference time (few-shot prompting, constraint decoding) and at training time (supervised fine-tuning, continual pretraining). Fine-tuning emerges as the most effective approach, while the combination of few-shot prompting and constraint decoding offers strong lower-resource alternatives. Our results show that small LLMs can match or even surpass larger baselines, with our best configuration based on Qwen3-1.7B achieving an average score +9.2 points higher than Qwen3-32B. We release a comprehensive collection of all the publicly available Italian medical datasets for NLP tasks, together with our top-performing models. Furthermore, we release an Italian dataset of 126M words from the Emergency Department of an Italian Hospital, and 175M words from various sources that we used for continual pre-training.

Motivation: Clinical free-text notes contain vital patient information. Recognizing sections in these notes supports clinical decision-making and NLP tasks.

Method: Curated a new de-identified, section-labeled obstetrics notes dataset. Evaluated transformer-based supervised models on MIMIC-III and the new obstetrics dataset. Conducted head-to-head comparison with zero-shot large language models.

Result: Supervised models perform well in-domain but poorly out-of-domain. Zero-shot models show robust out-of-domain adaptability with corrected hallucinations.

Conclusion: Developing domain-specific clinical resources is important. Zero-shot segmentation is a promising direction for healthcare NLP, provided hallucinations are managed.

Abstract: Clinical free-text notes contain vital patient information. They are structured into labelled sections; recognizing these sections has been shown to support clinical decision-making and downstream NLP tasks. In this paper, we advance clinical section segmentation through three key contributions. First, we curate a new de-identified, section-labeled obstetrics notes dataset, to supplement the medical domains covered in public corpora such as MIMIC-III, on which most existing segmentation approaches are trained. Second, we systematically evaluate transformer-based supervised models for section segmentation on a curated subset of MIMIC-III (in-domain), and on the new obstetrics dataset (out-of-domain). Third, we conduct the first head-to-head comparison of supervised models for medical section segmentation with zero-shot large language models. Our results show that while supervised models perform strongly in-domain, their performance drops substantially out-of-domain. In contrast, zero-shot models demonstrate robust out-of-domain adaptability once hallucinated section headers are corrected. These findings underscore the importance of developing domain-specific clinical resources and highlight zero-shot segmentation as a promising direction for applying healthcare NLP beyond well-studied corpora, as long as hallucinations are appropriately managed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在学生建模和学习分析中，细粒度技能表示（知识组件）是基本要素。然而，在现实世界的数据集中，很少提供知识组件级别的正确性标签，尤其是在涉及多个知识组件的开放式编程任务中。简单地将问题级别的正确性传播到所有相关知识组件会掩盖部分掌握，并导致学习曲线拟合不良。

Method: 提出了一种自动框架，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）直接从学生编写的代码中标记知识组件级别的正确性。该方法评估每个知识组件是否被正确应用，并进一步引入了时间上下文感知的代码-知识组件映射机制，以更好地将知识组件与个别学生代码对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明，与基线相比，该框架导致的学习曲线与认知理论更一致，并提高了预测性能。人类评估进一步表明，LLM和专家注释之间存在实质性的一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过利用LLMs直接从学生代码中标记知识组件级别的正确性，提高了学习曲线的拟合度和预测性能，并得到了专家注释的实质性支持。

Abstract: Fine-grained skill representations, commonly referred to as knowledge components (KCs), are fundamental to many approaches in student modeling and learning analytics. However, KC-level correctness labels are rarely available in real-world datasets, especially for open-ended programming tasks where solutions typically involve multiple KCs simultaneously. Simply propagating problem-level correctness to all associated KCs obscures partial mastery and often leads to poorly fitted learning curves. To address this challenge, we propose an automated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to label KC-level correctness directly from student-written code. Our method assesses whether each KC is correctly applied and further introduces a temporal context-aware Code-KC mapping mechanism to better align KCs with individual student code. We evaluate the resulting KC-level correctness labels in terms of learning curve fit and predictive performance using the power law of practice and the Additive Factors Model. Experimental results show that our framework leads to learning curves that are more consistent with cognitive theory and improves predictive performance, compared to baselines. Human evaluation further demonstrates substantial agreement between LLM and expert annotations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Instruction-following language models are trained to be helpful and safe, yet their safety behavior can deteriorate under benign fine-tuning and worsen under adversarial updates. Existing defenses often offer limited protection or force a trade-off between safety and utility. We introduce a training framework that adapts regularization in response to safety risk, enabling models to remain aligned throughout fine-tuning. To estimate safety risk at training time, we explore two distinct approaches: a judge-based Safety Critic that assigns high-level harm scores to training batches, and an activation-based risk predictor built with a lightweight classifier trained on intermediate model activations to estimate harmful intent. Each approach provides a risk signal that is used to constrain updates deemed higher risk to remain close to a safe reference policy, while lower-risk updates proceed with standard training. We empirically verify that harmful intent signals are predictable from pre-generation activations and that judge scores provide effective high-recall safety guidance. Across multiple model families and attack scenarios, adaptive regularization with either risk estimation approach consistently lowers attack success rate compared to standard fine-tuning, preserves downstream performance, and adds no inference-time cost. This work demonstrates a principled mechanism for maintaining safety without sacrificing utility.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Current speech LLMs largely perform implicit ASR: on tasks solvable from a transcript, they are behaviorally and mechanistically equivalent to simple Whisper$\to$LLM cascades. We show this through matched-backbone testing across four speech LLMs and six tasks, controlling for the LLM backbone for the first time. Ultravox is statistically indistinguishable from its matched cascade ($κ{=}0.93$); logit lens reveals literal text emerging in hidden states; LEACE concept erasure confirms text representations are causally necessary in both architectures tested, collapsing accuracy to near-zero. Qwen2-Audio genuinely diverges, revealing cascade equivalence is architecture-dependent, not universal. For most deployed use cases, current speech LLMs are expensive cascades, and under noise, they are worse ones, with clean-condition advantages reversing by up to 7.6% at 0 dB.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有波斯NLP基准测试在语用学和礼貌方面有所扩展，但很少区分记忆中的文化事实和推理隐含社会规范的能力。

Method: 引入DivanBench，一个专注于迷信和习俗的诊断基准，这些习俗是任意、依赖上下文的规则，难以简单逻辑推理。通过315个问题，涵盖三种任务类型（事实检索、成对场景验证和情境推理），评估了七个波斯LLMs。

Result: 大多数模型表现出严重的顺从偏差，正确识别适当的行为但无法拒绝明显的违规行为；持续的波斯预训练放大了这种偏差而不是提高推理能力，通常降低了模型辨别矛盾的能力；所有模型在检索事实知识和在场景中应用知识之间表现出21%的性能差距。

Conclusion: 文化能力需要超越单语数据的扩展，因为当前模型学习模仿文化模式，而没有内化底层架构。

Abstract: While emerging Persian NLP benchmarks have expanded into pragmatics and politeness, they rarely distinguish between memorized cultural facts and the ability to reason about implicit social norms. We introduce DivanBench, a diagnostic benchmark focused on superstitions and customs, arbitrary, context-dependent rules that resist simple logical deduction. Through 315 questions across three task types (factual retrieval, paired scenario verification, and situational reasoning), we evaluate seven Persian LLMs and reveal three critical failures: most models exhibit severe acquiescence bias, correctly identifying appropriate behaviors but failing to reject clear violations; continuous Persian pretraining amplifies this bias rather than improving reasoning, often degrading the model's ability to discern contradictions; and all models show a 21\% performance gap between retrieving factual knowledge and applying it in scenarios. These findings demonstrate that cultural competence requires more than scaling monolingual data, as current models learn to mimic cultural patterns without internalizing the underlying schemas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究表明，在合成语料库上训练的语言模型（LMs）会表现出类似于人类语言中跨语言规律的类型学偏好，特别是在诸如词序之类的句法现象上。本文将此范式扩展到差异论证标记（DAM），这是一种语义许可系统，其中形态标记取决于语义突出度。

Method: 使用受控的合成学习方法，我们在18个实现不同DAM系统的语料库上训练GPT-2模型，并使用最小对来评估它们的泛化能力。

Result: 结果显示，DAM的两个类型学维度之间存在分离。模型可靠地表现出类似人类的自然标记方向偏好，倾向于那些将标记指向语义上不典型论证的系统。然而，模型没有复制人类语言中强烈的宾语偏好，在DAM中，标记通常指向宾语而不是主语。

Conclusion: 这些发现表明，不同的类型学倾向可能源于不同的潜在来源。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that language models (LMs) trained on synthetic corpora can exhibit typological preferences that resemble cross-linguistic regularities in human languages, particularly for syntactic phenomena such as word order. In this paper, we extend this paradigm to differential argument marking (DAM), a semantic licensing system in which morphological marking depends on semantic prominence. Using a controlled synthetic learning method, we train GPT-2 models on 18 corpora implementing distinct DAM systems and evaluate their generalization using minimal pairs. Our results reveal a dissociation between two typological dimensions of DAM. Models reliably exhibit human-like preferences for natural markedness direction, favoring systems in which overt marking targets semantically atypical arguments. In contrast, models do not reproduce the strong object preference in human languages, in which overt marking in DAM more often targets objects rather than subjects. These findings suggest that different typological tendencies may arise from distinct underlying sources.

Motivation: 语言识别在多语言自然语言处理管道中是一个重要组成部分，尤其是在低资源和高相关语言设置中，现有系统仍然表现出脆弱性。

Method: 引入了UniLID，这是一种基于UnigramLM标记化算法的简单高效的LID方法，利用其概率框架、参数估计技术和推理策略。

Result: UniLID在标准基准测试中取得了具有竞争力的性能，在低资源环境中显著提高了样本效率，在细粒度方言识别方面取得了很大的进步。

Conclusion: UniLID是一种简单、高效的语言识别方法，适用于多语言自然语言处理，特别是在低资源和高相关语言设置中。

Abstract: Language Identification (LID) is an important component of many multilingual natural language processing pipelines, where it facilitates corpus curation, training data analysis, and cross-lingual evaluation of large language models. Despite near-perfect performance on high-resource languages, existing systems remain brittle in low-resource and closely related language settings. We introduce UniLID, a simple and efficient LID method based on the UnigramLM tokenization algorithm, leveraging its probabilistic framing, parameter estimation technique and inference strategy. In short, we learn language-conditional unigram distributions over a shared tokenizer vocabulary but treat segmentation as a language-specific phenomenon. Our formulation is data- and compute-efficient, supports incremental addition of new languages without retraining existing models, and can naturally be integrated into existing language model tokenization pipelines. Empirical evaluations against widely used baselines, including fastText, GlotLID, and CLD3, show that UniLID achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks, substantially improves sample efficiency in low-resource settings - surpassing 70% accuracy with as few as five labeled samples per language - and delivers large gains on fine-grained dialect identification.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对DLMs的剪枝方法，该方法自动剪枝不稳定汇点，提高了质量-效率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLMs的推理成本高，因为迭代去噪，推动了高效剪枝。

Method: 提出了一种名为Sink-Aware Pruning的方法，该方法是自动识别并剪枝DLM中的不稳定汇点。

Result: 该方法在不重新训练的情况下，实现了更好的质量-效率权衡，在匹配的计算能力下优于强大的先前剪枝基线。

Conclusion: 对DLMs的剪枝需要考虑注意力汇点的动态特性，以实现更好的质量-效率权衡。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) incur high inference cost due to iterative denoising, motivating efficient pruning. Existing pruning heuristics largely inherited from autoregressive (AR) LLMs, typically preserve attention sink tokens because AR sinks serve as stable global anchors. We show that this assumption does not hold for DLMs: the attention-sink position exhibits substantially higher variance over the full generation trajectory (measured by how the dominant sink locations shift across timesteps), indicating that sinks are often transient and less structurally essential than in AR models. Based on this observation, we propose ${\bf \texttt{Sink-Aware Pruning}}$, which automatically identifies and prunes unstable sinks in DLMs (prior studies usually keep sinks for AR LLMs). Without retraining, our method achieves a better quality-efficiency trade-off and outperforms strong prior pruning baselines under matched compute. Our code is available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/Sink-Aware-Pruning.

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种基于流的语言模型，它在质量和速度方面优于离散扩散模型，并在语言数据集上达到了最先进的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提供比自回归模型更快的生成速度，基于离散扩散的语言模型受到了广泛关注。然而，在实践中，它们在少量步骤的范围内表现出样本质量的急剧下降，无法实现这一承诺。

Method: 我们通过重新审视离散模态上流的根本原理，构建了一个基于流的语言模型（FLM），该模型通过对one-hot标记编码执行欧几里得去噪。通过预测清洁数据，我们引入了一种简单的时间重新参数化，这大大提高了训练稳定性和生成质量。通过将FLM提炼成其相关的流图，我们获得了一个精炼的流图语言模型（FMLM），它能够进行少量步骤的生成。

Result: 在LM1B和OWT语言数据集上，FLM达到了与最先进的离散扩散模型相匹配的生成质量。我们的方法在所有方面都优于最近的少量语言模型，一步生成超过了它们的8步质量。

Conclusion: 我们的工作质疑了广泛持有的假设，即离散扩散过程对于在离散模态上进行生成建模是必要的，并为大规模加速基于流的语言建模铺平了道路。

Abstract: Language models based on discrete diffusion have attracted widespread interest for their potential to provide faster generation than autoregressive models. In practice, however, they exhibit a sharp degradation of sample quality in the few-step regime, failing to realize this promise. Here we show that language models leveraging flow-based continuous denoising can outperform discrete diffusion in both quality and speed. By revisiting the fundamentals of flows over discrete modalities, we build a flow-based language model (FLM) that performs Euclidean denoising over one-hot token encodings. We show that the model can be trained by predicting the clean data via a cross entropy objective, where we introduce a simple time reparameterization that greatly improves training stability and generation quality. By distilling FLM into its associated flow map, we obtain a distilled flow map language model (FMLM) capable of few-step generation. On the LM1B and OWT language datasets, FLM attains generation quality matching state-of-the-art discrete diffusion models. With FMLM, our approach outperforms recent few-step language models across the board, with one-step generation exceeding their 8-step quality. Our work calls into question the widely held hypothesis that discrete diffusion processes are necessary for generative modeling over discrete modalities, and paves the way toward accelerated flow-based language modeling at scale.

TL;DR: MMCAformer结合微观驾驶行为和宏观交通特征，提高了速度预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高交通效率和安全性，准确的速度预测对主动交通管理至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种名为宏微观交叉注意力Transformer（MMCAformer）的方法，该方法结合了基于CV数据的微观驾驶行为特征和宏观交通特征。MMCAformer使用自注意力来学习宏观交通流中的内在依赖关系，并使用交叉注意力来捕获宏观交通状态和微观驾驶行为之间的时空交互作用。

Result: 在佛罗里达四条高速公路上的实验表明，与基线相比，MMCAformer在速度预测方面表现出优异的性能。与仅使用宏观特征相比，引入微观驾驶行为特征不仅提高了预测精度（例如，整体RMSE、MAE和MAPE分别降低了9.0%、6.9%和10.2%），而且缩小了模型预测的不确定性（例如，四个高速公路的平均预测区间降低了10.1-24.0%）。结果表明，急刹车和加速频率是影响最大的特征。在拥挤、低速交通条件下，这种改进更为明显。

Conclusion: MMCAformer通过结合微观驾驶行为特征和宏观交通特征，显著提高了速度预测的准确性和不确定性估计。

Abstract: Accurate speed prediction is crucial for proactive traffic management to enhance traffic efficiency and safety. Existing studies have primarily relied on aggregated, macroscopic traffic flow data to predict future traffic trends, whereas road traffic dynamics are also influenced by individual, microscopic human driving behaviors. Recent Connected Vehicle (CV) data provide rich driving behavior features, offering new opportunities to incorporate these behavioral insights into speed prediction. To this end, we propose the Macro-Micro Cross-Attention Transformer (MMCAformer) to integrate CV data-based micro driving behavior features with macro traffic features for speed prediction. Specifically, MMCAformer employs self-attention to learn intrinsic dependencies in macro traffic flow and cross-attention to capture spatiotemporal interplays between macro traffic status and micro driving behavior. MMCAformer is optimized with a Student-t negative log-likelihood loss to provide point-wise speed prediction and estimate uncertainty. Experiments on four Florida freeways demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MMCAformer compared to baselines. Compared with only using macro features, introducing micro driving behavior features not only enhances prediction accuracy (e.g., overall RMSE, MAE, and MAPE reduced by 9.0%, 6.9%, and 10.2%, respectively) but also shrinks model prediction uncertainty (e.g., mean predictive intervals decreased by 10.1-24.0% across the four freeways). Results reveal that hard braking and acceleration frequencies emerge as the most influential features. Such improvements are more pronounced under congested, low-speed traffic conditions.

Conclusion: LLMs在数据稀缺情况下具有分类电价波动的潜力

Abstract: This paper proposes a few-shot classification framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict whether the next day will have spikes in real-time electricity prices. The approach aggregates system state information, including electricity demand, renewable generation, weather forecasts, and recent electricity prices, into a set of statistical features that are formatted as natural-language prompts and fed to an LLM along with general instructions. The model then determines the likelihood that the next day would be a spike day and reports a confidence score. Using historical data from the Texas electricity market, we demonstrate that this few-shot approach achieves performance comparable to supervised machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines and XGBoost, and outperforms the latter two when limited historical data are available. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs as a data-efficient tool for classifying electricity price spikes in settings with scarce data.

Result: 正确识别91%的次生事故，AUC从0.654、0.744和0.902提高到0.952

Conclusion: 所提出的混合框架有效提高了次生事故预测的准确性

Abstract: Secondary crash likelihood prediction is a critical component of an active traffic management system to mitigate congestion and adverse impacts caused by secondary crashes. However, existing approaches mainly rely on post-crash features (e.g., crash type and severity) that are rarely available in real time, limiting their practical applicability. To address this limitation, we propose a hybrid secondary crash likelihood prediction framework that does not depend on post-crash features. A dynamic spatiotemporal window is designed to extract real-time traffic flow and environmental features from primary crash locations and their upstream segments. The framework includes three models: a primary crash model to estimate the likelihood of secondary crash occurrence, and two secondary crash models to evaluate traffic conditions at crash and upstream segments under different comparative scenarios. An ensemble learning strategy integrating six machine learning algorithms is developed to enhance predictive performance, and a voting-based mechanism combines the outputs of the three models. Experiments on Florida freeways demonstrate that the proposed hybrid framework correctly identifies 91% of secondary crashes with a low false alarm rate of 0.20. The Area Under the ROC Curve improves from 0.654, 0.744, and 0.902 for the individual models to 0.952 for the hybrid model, outperforming previous studies.

Abstract: Test-time scaling can improve model performance by aggregating stochastic reasoning trajectories. However, achieving sample-efficient test-time self-consistency under a limited budget remains an open challenge. We introduce PETS (Principled and Efficient Test-TimeSelf-Consistency), which initiates a principled study of trajectory allocation through an optimization framework. Central to our approach is the self-consistency rate, a new measure defined as agreement with the infinite-budget majority vote. This formulation makes sample-efficient test-time allocation theoretically grounded and amenable to rigorous analysis. We study both offline and online settings. In the offline regime, where all questions are known in advance, we connect trajectory allocation to crowdsourcing, a classic and well-developed area, by modeling reasoning traces as workers. This perspective allows us to leverage rich existing theory, yielding theoretical guarantees and an efficient majority-voting-based allocation algorithm. In the online streaming regime, where questions arrive sequentially and allocations must be made on the fly, we propose a novel method inspired by the offline framework. Our approach adapts budgets to question difficulty while preserving strong theoretical guarantees and computational efficiency. Experiments show that PETS consistently outperforms uniform allocation. On GPQA, PETS achieves perfect self-consistency in both settings while reducing the sampling budget by up to 75% (offline) and 55% (online) relative to uniform allocation.

Motivation: 理解算法任务中从记忆到泛化的延迟转换——Grokking——仍然知之甚少。

Method: 对在模块化算术上训练的Transformer的优化动态进行几何分析。

Result: 发现训练主要发生在低维执行子空间内，一个主成分可以捕捉到68-83%的轨迹方差。

Conclusion: 这些结果支持了一个几何解释，即Grokking反映了从低维约束和横向曲率积累的特征性亚稳态中逃逸。

Abstract: Grokking -- the delayed transition from memorization to generalization in small algorithmic tasks -- remains poorly understood. We present a geometric analysis of optimization dynamics in transformers trained on modular arithmetic. PCA of attention weight trajectories reveals that training evolves predominantly within a low-dimensional execution subspace, with a single principal component capturing 68-83% of trajectory variance. To probe loss-landscape geometry, we measure commutator defects -- the non-commutativity of successive gradient steps -- and project them onto this learned subspace. We find that curvature grows sharply in directions orthogonal to the execution subspace while the trajectory remains largely confined to it. Importantly, curvature growth consistently precedes generalization across learning rates and hyperparameter regimes, with the lead time obeying a power law in the grokking timescale. Causal intervention experiments show that motion along the learned subspace is necessary for grokking, while artificially increasing curvature is insufficient. Together, these results support a geometric account in which grokking reflects escape from a metastable regime characterized by low-dimensional confinement and transverse curvature accumulation. All findings replicate across this learning-rate range, a qualitatively different slow regime (lr=5e-5, wd=0.1, 3 layers), and three random seeds, though alignment dynamics differ quantitatively between regimes. Causal intervention experiments establish that orthogonal gradient flow is necessary but not sufficient for grokking: suppressing it prevents generalization with a monotonic dose-response across four operations, while artificially boosting curvature defects has no effect.

Abstract: The reliability of medical LLM evaluation is critically undermined by data contamination and knowledge obsolescence, leading to inflated scores on static benchmarks. To address these challenges, we introduce LiveClin, a live benchmark designed for approximating real-world clinical practice. Built from contemporary, peer-reviewed case reports and updated biannually, LiveClin ensures clinical currency and resists data contamination. Using a verified AI-human workflow involving 239 physicians, we transform authentic patient cases into complex, multimodal evaluation scenarios that span the entire clinical pathway. The benchmark currently comprises 1,407 case reports and 6,605 questions. Our evaluation of 26 models on LiveClin reveals the profound difficulty of these real-world scenarios, with the top-performing model achieving a Case Accuracy of just 35.7%. In benchmarking against human experts, Chief Physicians achieved the highest accuracy, followed closely by Attending Physicians, with both surpassing most models. LiveClin thus provides a continuously evolving, clinically grounded framework to guide the development of medical LLMs towards closing this gap and achieving greater reliability and real-world utility.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有效的冗余信息检测和减少方法，有助于提高机器学习模型的性能和效率。

Abstract: Modern datasets often contain ballast as redundant or low-utility information that increases dimensionality, storage requirements, and computational cost without contributing meaningful analytical value. This study introduces a generalized, multimodal framework for ballast detection and reduction across structured, semi-structured, unstructured, and sparse data types. Using diverse datasets, entropy, mutual information, Lasso, SHAP, PCA, topic modelling, and embedding analysis are applied to identify and eliminate ballast features. A novel Ballast Score is proposed to integrate these signals into a unified, cross-modal pruning strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that significant portions of the feature space as often exceeding 70% in sparse or semi-structured data, can be pruned with minimal or even improved classification performance, along with substantial reductions in training time and memory footprint. The framework reveals distinct ballast typologies (e.g. statistical, semantic, infrastructural), and offers practical guidance for leaner, more efficient machine learning pipelines.

Abstract: Modern machine learning-based wireless localization using Wi-Fi signals continues to face significant challenges in achieving groundbreaking performance across diverse environments. A major limitation is that most existing algorithms do not appropriately weight the information from different routers during aggregation, resulting in suboptimal convergence and reduced accuracy. Motivated by traditional weighted triangulation methods, this paper introduces the concept of attention to routers, ensuring that each router's contribution is weighted differently when aggregating information from multiple routers for triangulation. We demonstrate, by incorporating attention layers into a standard machine learning localization architecture, that emphasizing the relevance of each router can substantially improve overall performance. We have also shown through evaluation over the open-sourced datasets and demonstrate that Attention to Routers outperforms the benchmark architecture by over 30% in accuracy.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are leveraged to support new position, navigation, and timing (PNT) service alternatives to GNSS. These alternatives require accurate propagation of satellite position and velocity with a realistic quantification of uncertainty. It is commonly assumed that the propagated uncertainty distribution is Gaussian; however, the validity of this assumption can be quickly compromised by the mismodeling of atmospheric drag. We develop a machine learning approach that corrects error growth in the argument of latitude for a diverse set of LEO satellites. The improved orbit propagation accuracy extends the applicability of the Gaussian assumption and modeling of the errors with a corrected mean and covariance. We compare the performance of a time-conditioned neural network and a Gaussian Process on datasets computed with an open source orbit propagator and publicly available Vector Covariance Message (VCM) ephemerides. The learned models predict the argument of latitude error as a Gaussian distribution given parameters from a single VCM epoch and reverse propagation errors. We show that this one-dimensional model captures the effect of mismodeled drag, which can be mapped to the Cartesian state space. The correction method only updates information along the dimensions of dominant error growth, while maintaining the physics-based propagation of VCM covariance in the remaining dimensions. We therefore extend the utility of VCM ephemerides to longer time horizons without modifying the functionality of the existing propagator.

Conclusion: 该框架有助于提高语言模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance on a wide variety of tasks, modern language models remain susceptible to distribution shifts, exhibiting brittle behavior when evaluated on data that differs in distribution from their training data. In this paper, we describe how distribution shifts in language models can be separated into observable and unobservable components, and we discuss how established approaches for dealing with distribution shift address only the former. Importantly, we identify that the resulting omitted variable bias from unobserved variables can compromise both evaluation and optimization in language models. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework that maps the strength of the omitted variables to bounds on the worst-case generalization performance of language models under distribution shift. In empirical experiments, we show that using these bounds directly in language model evaluation and optimization provides more principled measures of out-of-distribution performance, improves true out-of-distribution performance relative to standard distribution shift adjustment methods, and further enables inference about the strength of the omitted variables when target distribution labels are available.

While recent work has demonstrated that labeled counterfactual tasks can be useful benchmarks of LLMs' causal reasoning, producing such data at the scale required to cover the vast potential space of counterfactuals is limited. In this work, we introduce double counterfactual consistency (DCC), a lightweight inference-time method for measuring and guiding the ability of LLMs to reason causally. Without requiring labeled counterfactual data, DCC verifies a model's ability to execute two important elements of causal reasoning: causal intervention and counterfactual prediction. Using DCC, we evaluate the causal reasoning abilities of various leading LLMs across a range of reasoning tasks and interventions. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DCC as a training-free test-time rejection sampling criterion and show that it can directly improve performance on reasoning tasks across multiple model families.

Conclusion: 模块化架构有效地缓解了梯度冲突，并且可以稳健地优于单体基线。

Abstract: Training large-scale generative models is resource-intensive and relies heavily on heuristic dataset weighting. We address two fundamental questions: Can we train Large Language Models (LLMs) modularly-combining small, domain-specific experts to match monolithic performance-and can we do so robustly for any data mixture, eliminating heuristic tuning? We present a theoretical framework for modular generative modeling where a set of pre-trained experts are combined via a gating mechanism. We define the space of normalized gating functions, $G_{1}$, and formulate the problem as a minimax game to find a single robust gate that minimizes divergence to the worst-case data mixture. We prove the existence of such a robust gate using Kakutani's fixed-point theorem and show that modularity acts as a strong regularizer, with generalization bounds scaling with the lightweight gate's complexity. Furthermore, we prove that this modular approach can theoretically outperform models retrained on aggregate data, with the gap characterized by the Jensen-Shannon Divergence. Finally, we introduce a scalable Stochastic Primal-Dual algorithm and a Structural Distillation method for efficient inference. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm that our modular architecture effectively mitigates gradient conflict and can robustly outperform monolithic baselines.

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种高效且成本低的推理流程，在IMO风格的数学问题上的性能达到最佳，同时显著降低了成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在过去一年中，定制的数学推理模型在国际数学奥林匹克（IMO）上取得了金牌成绩。然而，使用公开模型进行大规模推理虽然取得了类似的性能，但成本极高（例如，每个问题3000美元）。

Method: 我们提出了一种推理流程，该流程在IMO风格的数学问题上的性能达到最佳，同时平均推理成本比竞争方法低几个数量级，并且仅使用通用现成模型。该方法依赖于关于求解器-评分器管道中评分器失败的认识，我们称之为认知井（迭代细化收敛到错误解决方案，求解器和管道内部评分器都认为基本上是正确的）。我们的流程通过猜想提取来解决这些故障模式，其中候选引理从生成的解决方案中分离出来，并在一个全新的环境中独立验证，同时验证其否定（上下文分离）。

Result: 在IMO-ProofBench高级（PB-Adv）上，我们的流程使用Gemini 3.0 Pro实现了67.1%的性能，每个问题的平均成本约为31美元。在评估时，这代表了PB-Adv上公开和未发布模型中的最先进水平，并且成功率是下一个最佳公开可访问管道的两倍以上，成本却低得多。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在保持高性能的同时显著降低了成本，为IMO风格的数学问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In the past year, custom and unreleased math reasoning models reached gold medal performance on the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). Similar performance was then reported using large-scale inference on publicly available models but at prohibitive costs (e.g., 3000 USD per problem). In this work, we present an inference pipeline that attains best-in-class performance on IMO-style math problems at an average inference cost orders of magnitude below competing methods while using only general-purpose off-the-shelf models. Our method relies on insights about grader failure in solver-grader pipelines, which we call the Cognitive Well (iterative refinement converging to a wrong solution that the solver as well as the pipeline's internal grader consider to be basically correct). Our pipeline addresses these failure modes through conjecture extraction, wherein candidate lemmas are isolated from generated solutions and independently verified alongside their negations in a fresh environment (context detachment). On IMO-ProofBench Advanced (PB-Adv), our pipeline achieves 67.1 percent performance using Gemini 3.0 Pro with an average cost per question of approximately 31 USD. At the time of evaluation, this represented the state-of-the-art on PB-Adv among both public and unreleased models, and more than doubles the success rate of the next best publicly accessible pipeline, all at a fraction of the cost.

Motivation: LLMs的普及需要有效的机制来区分机器生成内容和人类文本。

Method: 提出了一种基于e-value的水印框架Anchored E-Watermarking，该框架将最优采样与任意时间有效的推理相结合。

Result: 通过模拟和基准测试评估，该框架可以显著提高样本效率，相对于最先进的基线，检测所需的平均令牌预算减少了13-15%。

Conclusion: Anchored E-Watermarking框架为区分机器生成内容和人类文本提供了一种有效的解决方案，并且提高了样本效率。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates efficient mechanisms to distinguish machine-generated content from human text. While statistical watermarking has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: the lack of a principled approach for selecting sampling distributions and the reliance on fixed-horizon hypothesis testing, which precludes valid early stopping. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing the first e-value-based watermarking framework, Anchored E-Watermarking, that unifies optimal sampling with anytime-valid inference. Unlike traditional approaches where optional stopping invalidates Type-I error guarantees, our framework enables valid, anytime-inference by constructing a test supermartingale for the detection process. By leveraging an anchor distribution to approximate the target model, we characterize the optimal e-value with respect to the worst-case log-growth rate and derive the optimal expected stopping time. Our theoretical claims are substantiated by simulations and evaluations on established benchmarks, showing that our framework can significantly enhance sample efficiency, reducing the average token budget required for detection by 13-15% relative to state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了TFFT，通过CVaR分解提高尾部控制效率，并在多个应用中证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了优化下游效用，对预训练的扩散和流模型进行微调是现实部署的关键。现有的基于熵正则化的方法主要最大化预期奖励，没有提供塑造尾部行为的机制。然而，尾部控制通常至关重要：下尾通过限制低奖励失败来决定可靠性，而上尾通过优先考虑罕见的高奖励结果来实现发现。

Method: 提出了Tail-aware Flow Fine-Tuning (TFFT)，这是一种基于条件价值在风险（CVaR）的原理和高效的分布式微调算法。解决了两个不同的尾部塑造目标：右-CVaR用于在高质量尾部寻找新样本，左-CVaR用于控制低质量尾部的最坏情况样本。与依赖于非线性优化的先前方法不同，我们利用CVaR的变分对偶形式将其分解为两个解耦的两阶段过程：一个轻量级的单维阈值优化步骤，以及通过特定伪奖励的单个熵正则化微调过程。这种分解以与标准预期微调方法相当的计算成本实现了CVaR微调的效率。

Result: 在说明性实验、高维文本到图像生成和分子设计方面展示了TFFT的有效性。

Conclusion: TFFT通过分解CVaR微调，提高了尾部控制的效率，并展示了其在多种应用场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion and flow models to optimize downstream utilities is central to real-world deployment. Existing entropy-regularized methods primarily maximize expected reward, providing no mechanism to shape tail behavior. However, tail control is often essential: the lower tail determines reliability by limiting low-reward failures, while the upper tail enables discovery by prioritizing rare, high-reward outcomes. In this work, we present Tail-aware Flow Fine-Tuning (TFFT), a principled and efficient distributional fine-tuning algorithm based on the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). We address two distinct tail-shaping goals: right-CVaR for seeking novel samples in the high-reward tail and left-CVaR for controlling worst-case samples in the low-reward tail. Unlike prior approaches that rely on non-linear optimization, we leverage the variational dual formulation of CVaR to decompose it into a decoupled two-stage procedure: a lightweight one-dimensional threshold optimization step, and a single entropy-regularized fine-tuning process via a specific pseudo-reward. This decomposition achieves CVaR fine-tuning efficiently with computational cost comparable to standard expected fine-tuning methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TFFT across illustrative experiments, high-dimensional text-to-image generation, and molecular design.

Conclusion: 弱-强验证策略和在线算法有助于提高LLMs推理的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Reasoning with LLMs increasingly unfolds inside a broader verification loop. Internally, systems use cheap checks, such as self-consistency or proxy rewards, which we call weak verification. Externally, users inspect outputs and steer the model through feedback until results are trustworthy, which we call strong verification. These signals differ sharply in cost and reliability: strong verification can establish trust but is resource-intensive, while weak verification is fast and scalable but noisy and imperfect. We formalize this tension through weak--strong verification policies, which decide when to accept or reject based on weak verification and when to defer to strong verification. We introduce metrics capturing incorrect acceptance, incorrect rejection, and strong-verification frequency. Over population, we show that optimal policies admit a two-threshold structure and that calibration and sharpness govern the value of weak verifiers. Building on this, we develop an online algorithm that provably controls acceptance and rejection errors without assumptions on the query stream, the language model, or the weak verifier.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose TopoFlow (Topography-aware pollutant Flow learning), a physics-guided neural network for efficient, high-resolution air quality prediction. To explicitly embed physical processes into the learning framework, we identify two critical factors governing pollutant dynamics: topography and wind direction. Complex terrain can channel, block, and trap pollutants, while wind acts as a primary driver of their transport and dispersion. Building on these insights, TopoFlow leverages a vision transformer architecture with two novel mechanisms: topography-aware attention, which explicitly models terrain-induced flow patterns, and wind-guided patch reordering, which aligns spatial representations with prevailing wind directions. Trained on six years of high-resolution reanalysis data assimilating observations from over 1,400 surface monitoring stations across China, TopoFlow achieves a PM2.5 RMSE of 9.71 ug/m3, representing a 71-80% improvement over operational forecasting systems and a 13% improvement over state-of-the-art AI baselines. Forecast errors remain well below China's 24-hour air quality threshold of 75 ug/m3 (GB 3095-2012), enabling reliable discrimination between clean and polluted conditions. These performance gains are consistent across all four major pollutants and forecast lead times from 12 to 96 hours, demonstrating that principled integration of physical knowledge into neural networks can fundamentally advance air quality prediction.

Conclusion: HiVAE在现实时空域中实现了ToM推理的扩展，但存在潜在表示缺乏明确依据的问题，需要进一步研究自监督对齐策略和grounding 方法。

Abstract: Theory of mind (ToM) enables AI systems to infer agents' hidden goals and mental states, but existing approaches focus mainly on small human understandable gridworld spaces. We introduce HiVAE, a hierarchical variational architecture that scales ToM reasoning to realistic spatiotemporal domains. Inspired by the belief-desire-intention structure of human cognition, our three-level VAE hierarchy achieves substantial performance improvements on a 3,185-node campus navigation task. However, we identify a critical limitation: while our hierarchical structure improves prediction, learned latent representations lack explicit grounding to actual mental states. We propose self-supervised alignment strategies and present this work to solicit community feedback on grounding approaches.

Result: 发现反馈与真理之间的差距是不可避免的，且取决于学习系统的调节方式

Conclusion: 反馈与真理之间的差距是学习过程中的一个基本约束，其后果取决于每个系统采用的调节方式。

Abstract: When feedback is absorbed faster than task structure can be evaluated, the learner will favor feedback over truth. A two-timescale model shows this feedback-truth gap is inevitable whenever the two rates differ and vanishes only when they match. We test this prediction across neural networks trained with noisy labels (30 datasets, 2,700 runs), human probabilistic reversal learning (N = 292), and human reward/punishment learning with concurrent EEG (N = 25). In each system, truth is defined operationally: held-out labels, the objectively correct option, or the participant's pre-feedback expectation - the only non-circular reference decodable from post-feedback EEG. The gap appeared universally but was regulated differently: dense networks accumulated it as memorization; sparse-residual scaffolding suppressed it; humans generated transient over-commitment that was actively recovered. Neural over-commitment (~0.04-0.10) was amplified tenfold into behavioral commitment (d = 3.3-3.9). The gap is a fundamental constraint on learning under noisy supervision; its consequences depend on the regulation each system employs.

TL;DR: VAM通过语言化掩码提高了LLM RL后训练中的学习效率和最终性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是强化学习（RL）在大语言模型（LLM）后训练中的关键瓶颈，稀疏反馈和大型动作空间可能导致过早陷入重复行为。

Method: 提出了一种名为VAM的方法，通过在提示中表达动作掩码，并强制模型从掩码集中输出动作。基于此接口，引入了迭代动作空间剪枝：如果目标动作没有被采样，则从掩码中删除有效的采样动作，并在减少的候选集下重新采样，重复进行，直到目标被采样或固定预算耗尽。

Result: 在象棋中研究了VAM，并在两种训练模式下对其进行了评估：一种是通过与引擎对手进行游戏生成状态的引擎游戏模式，另一种是从具有验证器分数的固定数据集进行训练的固定数据集模式。在保留的象棋谜题和通过平均百步损失（ACPL）衡量的完整游戏玩法中，VAM比强大的基线提高了学习效率和最终性能，突出了语言化掩码作为LLM RL后训练中可控探索的实用机制。

Conclusion: VAM在LLM RL后训练中提高了学习效率和最终性能，是一种实用的可控探索机制。

Abstract: Exploration remains a key bottleneck for reinforcement learning (RL) post-training of large language models (LLMs), where sparse feedback and large action spaces can lead to premature collapse into repetitive behaviors. We propose Verbalized Action Masking (VAM), which verbalizes an action mask in the prompt and enforces that the model outputs an action from the masked set. Building on this interface, we introduce iterative action-space pruning: if the target action is not sampled, we remove valid sampled actions from the mask and resample under the reduced candidate set, repeating until the target is sampled or a fixed budget is exhausted. We study VAM in chess and evaluate it under two training regimes: an engine-play regime that generates states via play against an engine opponent and a fixed-dataset regime that trains from a fixed dataset of positions with verifier scores. Across held-out chess puzzles and full-game play measured by average centipawn loss (ACPL), VAM improves learning efficiency and final performance over strong baselines, highlighting verbalized masking as a practical mechanism for controllable exploration in LLM RL post-training.

Motivation: Transformer模型在特定位置上存在偏好，但其架构起源尚不清楚。

Method: 提出了一种残差感知的累积注意力滚动理论，并通过结合残差连接来解释这一现象。

Result: 证明了因果Transformer在有限深度下会诱导U形位置偏差，注意力集中在早期和晚期标记上，从而解释了‘Lost-in-the-Middle’现象。

Conclusion: 残差连接可以防止Transformer模型在无限深度下的注意力崩溃，并解释了U形位置偏差的起源。

Abstract: Transformer models systematically favor certain token positions, yet the architectural origins of this position bias remain poorly understood. Under causal masking at infinite depth, prior theoretical analyses of attention rollout predict an inevitable collapse of attention onto the first token. Such collapse, however, does not occur in practice. We resolve this discrepancy with a residual-aware theory of cumulative attention rollout. By incorporating residual connections, we show that this architectural component prevents collapse under realistic conditions. At finite depth, we prove that causal Transformers induce a U-shaped position bias, with attention concentrating on early and late tokens. This result provides a principled architectural explanation for the Lost-in-the-Middle phenomenon.

TL;DR: 渐进式思维编码提高了大型推理模型的推理精度，并使其在内存受限的情况下进行强化学习训练更加高效和可扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂问题上的表现突出，但效率方面存在关键障碍：强化学习训练需要长时间的回滚以获得基于结果的奖励，其中自回归解码主导了时间和内存的使用。滑动窗口缓存策略可以限制内存，但会破坏长上下文推理并降低性能。

Method: 提出了一种名为渐进式思维编码的参数高效微调方法，该方法使大型推理模型能够在固定大小的缓存下有效推理。通过将中间推理逐步编码为固定大小的向量表示，该方法消除了通过完整缓存回滚反向传播的需要，从而减少了内存使用，同时在推理过程中保持内存不变。

Result: 在三个模型上进行了实验，包括Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct、Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct和DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B，在六个广泛使用的具有挑战性的数学基准测试中，平均实现了+19.3%的改进，比基于LoRA的微调提高了+29.9%，在没有微调的大型推理模型上提高了+29.9%。在相同的紧缩缓存预算下，AIME2024/2025的准确率提高了+23.4%。

Conclusion: 渐进式思维编码不仅提高了推理精度，而且在实际内存限制下，使大型推理模型的强化学习训练更加高效和可扩展。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel on complex problems but face a critical barrier to efficiency: reinforcement learning (RL) training requires long rollouts for outcome-based rewards, where autoregressive decoding dominates time and memory usage. While sliding-window cache strategies can bound memory, they disrupt long-context reasoning and degrade performance. We introduce Progressive Thought Encoding, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that enables LRMs to reason effectively under fixed-size caches. By progressively encoding intermediate reasoning into fixed-size vector representations, our approach eliminates the need to backpropagate through full-cache rollouts, thereby reducing memory usage, while maintaining constant memory during inference. Experiments on three models, including Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, on six widely used challenging mathematical benchmarks show consistent gains: our method achieves +19.3% improvement over LoRA-based fine-tuning and +29.9% over LRMs without fine-tuning on average, with up to +23.4 accuracy improvement on AIME2024/2025 under the same tight cache budgets. These results demonstrate that Progressive Thought Encoding not only improves reasoning accuracy but also makes RL training of LRMs substantially more efficient and scalable under real-world memory constraints.

Abstract: We study the offline data-driven newsvendor problem with censored demand data. In contrast to prior works where demand is fully observed, we consider the setting where demand is censored at the inventory level and only sales are observed; sales match demand when there is sufficient inventory, and equal the available inventory otherwise. We provide a general procedure to compute the exact worst-case regret of classical data-driven inventory policies, evaluated over all demand distributions. Our main technical result shows that this infinite-dimensional, non-convex optimization problem can be reduced to a finite-dimensional one, enabling an exact characterization of the performance of policies for any sample size and censoring levels. We leverage this reduction to derive sharp insights on the achievable performance of standard inventory policies under demand censoring. In particular, our analysis of the Kaplan-Meier policy shows that while demand censoring fundamentally limits what can be learned from passive sales data, just a small amount of targeted exploration at high inventory levels can substantially improve worst-case guarantees, enabling near-optimal performance even under heavy censoring. In contrast, when the point-of-sale system does not record stockout events and only reports realized sales, a natural and commonly used approach is to treat sales as demand. Our results show that policies based on this sales-as-demand heuristic can suffer severe performance degradation as censored data accumulates, highlighting how the quality of point-of-sale information critically shapes what can, and cannot, be learned offline.

Conclusion: 提出fail-closed alignment作为稳健LLM安全性的设计原则，通过机制分析证实其有效性。

Abstract: We identify a structural weakness in current large language model (LLM) alignment: modern refusal mechanisms are fail-open. While existing approaches encode refusal behaviors across multiple latent features, suppressing a single dominant feature$-$via prompt-based jailbreaks$-$can cause alignment to collapse, leading to unsafe generation. Motivated by this, we propose fail-closed alignment as a design principle for robust LLM safety: refusal mechanisms should remain effective even under partial failures via redundant, independent causal pathways. We present a concrete instantiation of this principle: a progressive alignment framework that iteratively identifies and ablates previously learned refusal directions, forcing the model to reconstruct safety along new, independent subspaces. Across four jailbreak attacks, we achieve the strongest overall robustness while mitigating over-refusal and preserving generation quality, with small computational overhead. Our mechanistic analyses confirm that models trained with our method encode multiple, causally independent refusal directions that prompt-based jailbreaks cannot suppress simultaneously, providing empirical support for fail-closed alignment as a principled foundation for robust LLM safety.

Abstract: Time series (TS) modeling has come a long way from early statistical, mainly linear, approaches to the current trend in TS foundation models. With a lot of hype and industrial demand in this field, it is not always clear how much progress there really is. To advance TS forecasting and analysis to the next level, here we argue that the field needs a dynamical systems (DS) perspective. TS of observations from natural or engineered systems almost always originate from some underlying DS, and arguably access to its governing equations would yield theoretically optimal forecasts. This is the promise of DS reconstruction (DSR), a class of ML/AI approaches that aim to infer surrogate models of the underlying DS from data. But models based on DS principles offer other profound advantages: Beyond short-term forecasts, they enable to predict the long-term statistics of an observed system, which in many practical scenarios may be the more relevant quantities. DS theory furthermore provides domain-independent theoretical insight into mechanisms underlying TS generation, and thereby will inform us, e.g., about upper bounds on performance of any TS model, generalization into unseen regimes as in tipping points, or potential control strategies. After reviewing some of the central concepts, methods, measures, and models in DS theory and DSR, we will discuss how insights from this field can advance TS modeling in crucial ways, enabling better forecasting with much lower computational and memory footprints. We conclude with a number of specific suggestions for translating insights from DSR into TS modeling.

Abstract: Modern language models exhibit rich internal structure, yet little is known about how privacy-sensitive behaviors, such as personally identifiable information (PII) leakage, are represented and modulated within their hidden states. We present UniLeak, a mechanistic-interpretability framework that identifies universal activation directions: latent directions in a model's residual stream whose linear addition at inference time consistently increases the likelihood of generating PII across prompts. These model-specific directions generalize across contexts and amplify PII generation probability, with minimal impact on generation quality. UniLeak recovers such directions without access to training data or groundtruth PII, relying only on self-generated text. Across multiple models and datasets, steering along these universal directions substantially increases PII leakage compared to existing prompt-based extraction methods. Our results offer a new perspective on PII leakage: the superposition of a latent signal in the model's representations, enabling both risk amplification and mitigation.

Abstract: To build a dementia classification model for middle-aged and elderly Brazilians, implemented in Python, combining variable selection and multivariable analysis, using low-cost variables with modification potential. Observational study with a predictive modeling approach using a cross-sectional design, aimed at estimating the chances of developing dementia, using data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), involving 9,412 participants. Dementia was determined based on neuropsychological assessment and informant-based cognitive function. Analyses were performed using Random Forest (RF) and multivariable logistic regression to estimate the risk of dementia in the middle-aged and elderly populations of Brazil. The prevalence of dementia was 9.6%. The highest odds of dementia were observed in illiterate individuals (Odds Ratio (OR) = 7.42), individuals aged 90 years or older (OR = 11.00), low weight (OR = 2.11), low handgrip strength (OR = 2.50), self-reported black skin color (OR = 1.47), physical inactivity (OR = 1.61), self-reported hearing loss (OR = 1.65), and presence of depressive symptoms (OR = 1.72). Higher education (OR=0.44), greater life satisfaction (OR=0.72), and being employed (OR=0.78) were protective factors. The RF model outperformed logistic regression, achieving an area under the ROC curve of 0.776, with a sensitivity of 0.708, a specificity of 0.702, an F1-score of 0.311, a G-means of 0.705, and an accuracy of 0.703. Conclusion: The findings reinforce the multidimensional nature of dementia and the importance of accessible factors for identifying vulnerable individuals. Strengthening public policies focused on promoting brain health can contribute significantly to the efficient allocation of resources in primary care and dementia prevention in Brazil

Conclusion: SymGraph 是一种超越现有限制的可解释 GNNs 框架，具有提高性能和可解释性的潜力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery, yet their black-box nature remains a significant barrier to trustworthiness. While self-explainable GNNs attempt to bridge this gap, they often rely on standard message-passing backbones that inherit fundamental limitations, including the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) expressivity barrier and a lack of fine-grained interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose SymGraph, a symbolic framework designed to transcend these constraints. By replacing continuous message passing with discrete structural hashing and topological role-based aggregation, our architecture theoretically surpasses the 1-WL barrier, achieving superior expressiveness without the overhead of differentiable optimization. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that SymGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing self-explainable GNNs. Notably, SymGraph delivers 10x to 100x speedups in training time using only CPU execution. Furthermore, SymGraph generates rules with superior semantic granularity compared to existing rule-based methods, offering great potential for scientific discovery and explainable AI.

Result: 建立了近最优的遗憾界限为$	ilde{O}(T^{(d+1)/(d+2)})$，加上一个与T无关的协调成本，匹配单玩家速率。这是第一个提供此类保证的框架，并扩展到一般距离阈值碰撞模型。

Conclusion: 提出了一个新颖的解决去中心化多玩家随机带阻问题的框架，在无需通信的情况下最大化集体奖励，同时保持了与单玩家速率相匹配的效率。

Abstract: We study the decentralized multi-player stochastic bandit problem over a continuous, Lipschitz-structured action space where hard collisions yield zero reward. Our objective is to design a communication-free policy that maximizes collective reward, with coordination costs that are independent of the time horizon $T$. We propose a modular protocol that first solves the multi-agent coordination problem -- identifying and seating players on distinct high-value regions via a novel maxima-directed search -- and then decouples the problem into $N$ independent single-player Lipschitz bandits. We establish a near-optimal regret bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{(d+1)/(d+2)})$ plus a $T$-independent coordination cost, matching the single-player rate. To our knowledge, this is the first framework providing such guarantees, and it extends to general distance-threshold collision models.

Abstract: Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is fundamentally challenged by the curse of dimensionality. A common solution is to exploit locality, which hinges on an Exponential Decay Property (EDP) of the value function. However, existing conditions that guarantee the EDP are often conservative, as they are based on worst-case, environment-only bounds (e.g., supremums over actions) and fail to capture the regularizing effect of the policy itself. In this work, we establish that locality can also be a \emph{policy-dependent} phenomenon. Our central contribution is a novel decomposition of the policy-induced interdependence matrix, $H^π$, which decouples the environment's sensitivity to state ($E^{\mathrm{s}}$) and action ($E^{\mathrm{a}}$) from the policy's sensitivity to state ($Π(π)$). This decomposition reveals that locality can be induced by a smooth policy (small $Π(π)$) even when the environment is strongly action-coupled, exposing a fundamental locality-optimality tradeoff. We use this framework to derive a general spectral condition $ρ(E^{\mathrm{s}}+E^{\mathrm{a}}Π(π)) < 1$ for exponential decay, which is strictly tighter than prior norm-based conditions. Finally, we leverage this theory to analyze a provably-sound localized block-coordinate policy improvement framework with guarantees tied directly to this spectral radius.

Result: 发现交换子缺陷是泛化延迟的早期预警信号

Conclusion: 交换子缺陷是Transformer中泛化延迟的稳健、架构无关的因果影响因素

Abstract: Grokking -- the abrupt transition from memorization to generalization after prolonged training -- has been linked to confinement on low-dimensional execution manifolds in modular arithmetic. Whether this mechanism extends beyond arithmetic remains open. We study two sequence-learning benchmarks: SCAN compositional generalization and Dyck-1 depth prediction. Across both tasks and a wide range of learning rates, the commutator defect -- a curvature measure derived from non-commuting gradient updates -- rises well before generalization, with lead times following a superlinear power law (alpha approximately 1.18 for SCAN, approximately 1.13 for Dyck), consistent with prior results on modular arithmetic. Weight-space PCA reveals that spectral concentration is not a universal precursor; the commutator defect is. Causal interventions demonstrate a mechanistic role: amplifying non-commutativity accelerates grokking (roughly 32% on SCAN, roughly 50% on Dyck), while suppressing orthogonal gradient flow delays or prevents it. The three task families form a spectrum of causal sensitivity -- modular arithmetic is rigid, Dyck is responsive, SCAN is intermediate -- yet suppression delays or prevents grokking in all cases, establishing necessity as a universal finding. These results identify the commutator defect as a robust, architecture-agnostic, causally implicated early-warning signal for delayed generalization in transformers.

Motivation: 协调行动是多智能体强化学习中最基本的合作形式。成功的分散决策不仅取决于良好的个体行动，还取决于选择兼容的行动以同步行为、避免冲突和满足全局约束。

Method: 本文提出了动作图策略（AGP），该策略通过模型化智能体可用动作选择之间的依赖关系来构建协调上下文，使智能体能够根据全局动作依赖关系来调整其决策。

Result: 理论上，我们证明了AGP比完全独立的策略具有更强的表达能力，并且可以实现比贪婪执行更优的协调联合行动。在实验中，AGP在具有部分可观察性和反协调惩罚的经典协调任务中实现了80-95%的成功率，而其他MARL方法仅达到10-25%。此外，AGP在多种多智能体环境中始终优于这些基线。

Conclusion: AGP是一种有效的多智能体强化学习方法，能够实现比贪婪执行更优的协调联合行动，并在多种环境中优于其他方法。

Abstract: Coordinating actions is the most fundamental form of cooperation in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Successful decentralized decision-making often depends not only on good individual actions, but on selecting compatible actions across agents to synchronize behavior, avoid conflicts, and satisfy global constraints. In this paper, we propose Action Graph Policies (AGP), that model dependencies among agents' available action choices. It constructs, what we call, \textit{coordination contexts}, that enable agents to condition their decisions on global action dependencies. Theoretically, we show that AGPs induce a strictly more expressive joint policy compared to fully independent policies and can realize coordinated joint actions that are provably more optimal than greedy execution even from centralized value-decomposition methods. Empirically, we show that AGP achieves 80-95\% success on canonical coordination tasks with partial observability and anti-coordination penalties, where other MARL methods reach only 10-25\%. We further demonstrate that AGP consistently outperforms these baselines in diverse multi-agent environments.

Abstract: We establish a rigorous connection between pathwise (reparameterization) and score-function (Malliavin) gradient estimators by showing that both arise from the Malliavin integration-by-parts identity. Building on this equivalence, we introduce a unified and variance-aware hybrid estimator that adaptively combines pathwise and Malliavin gradients using their empirical covariance structure. The resulting formulation provides a principled understanding of stochastic backpropagation and achieves minimum variance among all unbiased linear combinations, with closed-form finite-sample convergence bounds. We demonstrate 9% variance reduction on VAEs (CIFAR-10) and up to 35% on strongly-coupled synthetic problems. Exploratory policy gradient experiments reveal that non-stationary optimization landscapes present challenges for the hybrid approach, highlighting important directions for future work. Overall, this work positions Malliavin calculus as a conceptually unifying and practically interpretable framework for stochastic gradient estimation, clarifying when hybrid approaches provide tangible benefits and when they face inherent limitations.

Result: WS-GRPO显著减少了样本展开长度，同时与GRPO基线保持竞争力。

Conclusion: WS-GRPO是一种有效的语言模型推理方法，在保持推理准确性的同时提高了推理效率。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is effective for training language models on complex reasoning. However, since the objective is defined relative to a group of sampled trajectories, extended deliberation can create more chances to realize relative gains, leading to inefficient reasoning and overthinking, and complicating the trade-off between correctness and rollout efficiency. Controlling this behavior is difficult in practice, considering (i) Length penalties are hard to calibrate because longer rollouts may reflect harder problems that require longer reasoning, penalizing tokens risks truncating useful reasoning along with redundant continuation; and (ii) supervision that directly indicates when to continue or stop is typically unavailable beyond final answer correctness. We propose Weakly Supervised GRPO (WS-GRPO), which improves rollout efficiency by converting terminal rewards into correctness-aware guidance over partial trajectories. Unlike global length penalties that are hard to calibrate, WS-GRPO trains a preference model from outcome-only correctness to produce prefix-level signals that indicate when additional continuation is beneficial. Thus, WS-GRPO supplies outcome-derived continue/stop guidance, reducing redundant deliberation while maintaining accuracy. We provide theoretical results and empirically show on reasoning benchmarks that WS-GRPO substantially reduces rollout length while remaining competitive with GRPO baselines.

Abstract: Scientific discovery pipelines typically involve complex, rigid, and time-consuming processes, from data preparation to analyzing and interpreting findings. Recent advances in AI have the potential to transform such pipelines in a way that domain experts can focus on interpreting and understanding findings, rather than debugging rigid pipelines or manually annotating data. As part of an active collaboration between data science/AI researchers and behavioral neuroscientists, we showcase an example AI-enhanced pipeline, specifically designed to transform and accelerate the way that the domain experts in the team are able to gain insights out of experimental data. The application at hand is in the domain of behavioral neuroscience, studying fear generalization in mice, an important problem whose progress can advance our understanding of clinically significant and often debilitating conditions such as PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). We identify the emerging paradigm of "In-Context Learning" (ICL) as a suitable interface for domain experts to automate parts of their pipeline without the need for or familiarity with AI model training and fine-tuning, and showcase its remarkable efficacy in data preparation and pattern interpretation. Also, we introduce novel AI-enhancements to tensor decomposition model, which allows for more seamless pattern discovery from the heterogeneous data in our application. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed pipeline experimentally, showcasing its superior performance compared to what is standard practice in the domain, as well as against reasonable ML baselines that do not fall under the ICL paradigm, to ensure that we are not compromising performance in our quest for a seamless and easy-to-use interface for domain experts. Finally, we demonstrate effective discovery, with results validated by the domain experts in the team.

Abstract: Mental health disorders affect over 1 billion people worldwide, yet access to care remains limited by workforce shortages and cost constraints. While AI systems show therapeutic promise, current alignment approaches optimize objectives independently, failing to balance patient preferences with clinical safety. We survey 335 individuals with lived mental health experience to collect preference rankings across therapeutic dimensions, then develop a multi-objective alignment framework using direct preference optimization. We train reward models for six criteria -- empathy, safety, active listening, self-motivated change, trust/rapport, and patient autonomy -- and systematically compare multi-objective approaches against single-objective optimization, supervised fine-tuning, and parameter merging. Multi-objective DPO (MODPO) achieves superior balance (77.6% empathy, 62.6% safety) compared to single-objective optimization (93.6% empathy, 47.8% safety), and therapeutic criteria outperform general communication principles by 17.2%. Blinded clinician evaluation confirms MODPO is consistently preferred, with LLM-evaluator agreement comparable to inter-clinician reliability.

Motivation: 检测时间序列数据中的异常对于确保系统可靠性和进行预防性维护至关重要。然而，现有方法大多是反应性的，只能在异常发生后检测到异常，缺乏提供主动预警信号的能力。

Method: 提出了一种名为FATE的新颖的无监督框架，通过量化来自多样化的时间序列预测模型的预测不确定性来检测异常的前兆（PoA）。

Result: 在五个真实世界基准数据集上的实验表明，FATE在PTaPR AUC方面平均提高了19.9个百分点，在早期检测F1分数方面平均提高了20.02个百分点，优于基线，且不需要异常标签。

Conclusion: FATE对于复杂时间序列环境中的实时无监督早期预警是有效且实用的。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in time-series data is critical in domains such as industrial operations, finance, and cybersecurity, where early identification of abnormal patterns is essential for ensuring system reliability and enabling preventive maintenance. However, most existing methods are reactive: they detect anomalies only after they occur and lack the capability to provide proactive early warning signals. In this paper, we propose FATE (Forecasting Anomalies with Time-series Ensembles), a novel unsupervised framework for detecting Precursors-of-Anomaly (PoA) by quantifying predictive uncertainty from a diverse ensemble of time-series forecasting models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on reconstruction errors or require ground-truth labels, FATE anticipates future values and leverages ensemble disagreement to signal early signs of potential anomalies without access to target values at inference time. To rigorously evaluate PoA detection, we introduce Precursor Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (PTaPR), a new metric that extends the traditional Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (TaPR) by jointly assessing segment-level accuracy, within-segment coverage, and temporal promptness of early predictions. This enables a more holistic assessment of early warning capabilities that existing metrics overlook. Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets show that FATE achieves an average improvement of 19.9 percentage points in PTaPR AUC and 20.02 percentage points in early detection F1 score, outperforming baselines while requiring no anomaly labels. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of FATE for real-time unsupervised early warning in complex time-series environments.

Method: 提出一种名为Multi-Probe Zero Collision Hash (MPZCH)的新型索引机制，基于线性探测来有效缓解嵌入冲突。

Result: MPZCH在合理的表尺寸下通常可以完全消除冲突，同时保持生产规模效率。该方法利用辅助张量和高性能CUDA内核实现可配置的探测和主动驱逐策略，防止哈希方法中常见的过时嵌入继承。在线实验表明，MPZCH实现了用户嵌入的零冲突，显著提高了物品嵌入的新鲜度和质量。

Conclusion: MPZCH是一种有效的索引机制，可以显著提高大规模推荐系统的性能和个性化质量。

Abstract: Embedding tables are critical components of large-scale recommendation systems, facilitating the efficient mapping of high-cardinality categorical features into dense vector representations. However, as the volume of unique IDs expands, traditional hash-based indexing methods suffer from collisions that degrade model performance and personalization quality. We present Multi-Probe Zero Collision Hash (MPZCH), a novel indexing mechanism based on linear probing that effectively mitigates embedding collisions. With reasonable table sizing, it often eliminates these collisions entirely while maintaining production-scale efficiency. MPZCH utilizes auxiliary tensors and high-performance CUDA kernels to implement configurable probing and active eviction policies. By retiring obsolete IDs and resetting reassigned slots, MPZCH prevents the stale embedding inheritance typical of hash-based methods, ensuring new features learn effectively from scratch. Despite its collision-mitigation overhead, the system maintains training QPS and inference latency comparable to existing methods. Rigorous online experiments demonstrate that MPZCH achieves zero collisions for user embeddings and significantly improves item embedding freshness and quality. The solution has been released within the open-source TorchRec library for the broader community.

Conclusion: 符号位翻转对模型性能有重要影响，有效的初始化和正则化可以降低翻转率，提高模型性能。

Abstract: Sub-bit model compression seeks storage below one bit per weight; as magnitudes are aggressively compressed, the sign bit becomes a fixed-cost bottleneck. Across Transformers, CNNs, and MLPs, learned sign matrices resist low-rank approximation and are spectrally indistinguishable from an i.i.d. Rademacher baseline. Despite this apparent randomness, most weights retain their initialization signs; flips primarily occur via rare near-zero boundary crossings, suggesting that sign-pattern randomness is largely inherited from initialization. We formalize this behavior with sign lock-in theory, a stopping-time analysis of sign flips under SGD noise. Under bounded updates and a rare re-entry condition into a small neighborhood around zero, the number of effective sign flips exhibits a geometric tail. Building on this mechanism, we introduce a gap-based initialization and a lightweight outward-drift regularizer, reducing the effective flip rate to approximately $10^{-3}$ with only about a one-point increase in perplexity.

We propose a new optimizer and a diagonal extension, NAMO and NAMO-D, providing the first principled integration of orthogonalized momentum with norm-based Adam-type noise adaptation. NAMO scales orthogonalized momentum using a single adaptive stepsize, preserving orthogonality while improving upon Muon at negligible additional cost. NAMO-D instead right-multiplies orthogonalized momentum by a diagonal matrix with clamped entries. This design enables neuron-wise noise adaptation and aligns with the common near block-diagonal Hessian structure. Under standard assumptions, we establish optimal convergence rates for both algorithms in the deterministic setting and show that, in the stochastic setting, their convergence guarantees adapt to the noise level of stochastic gradients. Experiments on pretraining GPT-2 models demonstrate improved performance of both NAMO and NAMO-D compared to the AdamW and Muon baselines, with NAMO-D achieving further gains over NAMO via an additional clamping hyperparameter that balances the competing goals of maintaining a well-conditioned update direction and leveraging fine-grained noise adaptation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的机器反学习框架MeGU，通过概念感知的重对齐和噪声对技术，实现可控和选择性地遗忘，有效保护了数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练数据隐私的日益关注使“被遗忘权”成为一项关键要求，从而提高了有效机器反学习的需求。然而，现有的反学习方法通常存在一个基本权衡：积极删除目标数据的影响往往降低保留数据的模型效用，而保守策略则保留了残留的目标信息。

Method: 分析模型预训练期间学习的内在表示特性，提出机器引导的反学习（MeGU）框架，该框架通过概念感知的重对齐来指导反学习。具体而言，利用多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）显式确定目标样本的重对齐方向，通过分配具有语义意义的扰动标签。为了提高效率，将MLLM估计的类间概念相似度编码为轻量级转换矩阵。此外，MeGU引入了正负特征噪声对，以显式分离目标概念的影响。在微调期间，负噪声抑制目标特定的特征模式，而正噪声增强剩余的相关特征，并使它们与扰动概念对齐。这种协调设计使得可以选择性地破坏目标特定的表示，同时保留共享的语义结构。

Result: MeGU使可控和选择性地遗忘成为可能，有效地减轻了欠学习和过度学习。

Conclusion: MeGU框架有效地解决了现有反学习方法的权衡问题，通过概念感知的重对齐实现了更有效的数据隐私保护。

Abstract: The growing concern over training data privacy has elevated the "Right to be Forgotten" into a critical requirement, thereby raising the demand for effective Machine Unlearning. However, existing unlearning approaches commonly suffer from a fundamental trade-off: aggressively erasing the influence of target data often degrades model utility on retained data, while conservative strategies leave residual target information intact. In this work, the intrinsic representation properties learned during model pretraining are analyzed. It is demonstrated that semantic class concepts are entangled at the feature-pattern level, sharing associated features while preserving concept-specific discriminative components. This entanglement fundamentally limits the effectiveness of existing unlearning paradigms. Motivated by this insight, we propose Machine-Guided Unlearning (MeGU), a novel framework that guides unlearning through concept-aware re-alignment. Specifically, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are leveraged to explicitly determine re-alignment directions for target samples by assigning semantically meaningful perturbing labels. To improve efficiency, inter-class conceptual similarities estimated by the MLLM are encoded into a lightweight transition matrix. Furthermore, MeGU introduces a positive-negative feature noise pair to explicitly disentangle target concept influence. During finetuning, the negative noise suppresses target-specific feature patterns, while the positive noise reinforces remaining associated features and aligns them with perturbing concepts. This coordinated design enables selective disruption of target-specific representations while preserving shared semantic structures. As a result, MeGU enables controlled and selective forgetting, effectively mitigating both under-unlearning and over-unlearning.

Abstract: Diffusion models recently developed for generative AI tasks can produce high-quality samples while still maintaining diversity among samples to promote mode coverage, providing a promising path for learning stochastic closure models. Compared to other types of generative AI models, such as GANs and VAEs, the sampling speed is known as a key disadvantage of diffusion models. By systematically comparing transport-based generative models on a numerical example of 2D Kolmogorov flows, we show that flow matching in a lower-dimensional latent space is suited for fast sampling of stochastic closure models, enabling single-step sampling that is up to two orders of magnitude faster than iterative diffusion-based approaches. To control the latent space distortion and thus ensure the physical fidelity of the sampled closure term, we compare the implicit regularization offered by a joint training scheme against two explicit regularizers: metric-preserving (MP) and geometry-aware (GA) constraints. Besides offering a faster sampling speed, both explicitly and implicitly regularized latent spaces inherit the key topological information from the lower-dimensional manifold of the original complex dynamical system, which enables the learning of stochastic closure models without demanding a huge amount of training data.

Conclusion: FLoRG框架在联邦微调中表现出色，提高了微调效率和准确性，同时减少了通信开销

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) enable large language models (LLMs) to adapt to downstream tasks efficiently. Federated learning (FL) further facilitates this process by enabling collaborative fine-tuning across distributed clients without sharing private data. However, the use of two separate low-rank matrices in LoRA for federated fine-tuning introduces two types of challenges. The first challenge arises from the error induced by separately aggregating those two low-rank matrices. The second challenge occurs even when the product of two low-rank matrices is aggregated. The server needs to recover factors via matrix decomposition, which is non-unique and can introduce decomposition drift. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose FLoRG, a federated fine-tuning framework which employs a single low-rank matrix for fine-tuning and aggregates its Gram matrix (i.e., the matrix of inner products of its column vectors), eliminating the aggregation error while also reducing the communication overhead. FLoRG minimizes the decomposition drift by introducing a Procrustes alignment approach which aligns the decomposed matrix between consecutive fine-tuning rounds for consistent updates. We theoretically analyze the convergence of FLoRG and prove that adopting the Procrustes alignment results in a tighter convergence bound. Experimental results across multiple LLM fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FLoRG outperforms five state-of-the-art baseline schemes in the downstream task accuracy and can reduce the communication overhead by up to 2041$\times$.

Conclusion: 无服务器MLOps框架能够实现机器学习的可操作化，并为企业提供了一种可扩展且成本效益高的方法来优化性能和经济效益。

Abstract: This paper presents a serverless MLOps framework orchestrating the complete ML lifecycle from data ingestion, training, deployment, monitoring, and retraining to using event-driven pipelines and managed services. The architecture is model-agnostic, supporting diverse inference patterns through standardized interfaces, enabling rapid adaptation without infrastructure overhead. We demonstrate practical applicability through an industrial implementation for Harmonized System (HS) code prediction, a compliance-critical task where short, unstructured product descriptions are mapped to standardized codes used by customs authorities in global trade. Frequent updates and ambiguous descriptions make classification challenging, with errors causing shipment delays and financial losses. Our solution uses a custom text embedding encoder and multiple deep learning architectures, with Text-CNN achieving 98 percent accuracy on ground truth data. Beyond accuracy, the pipeline ensures reproducibility, auditability, and SLA adherence under variable loads via auto-scaling. A key feature is automated A/B testing, enabling dynamic model selection and safe promotion in production. Cost-efficiency drives model choice; while transformers may achieve similar accuracy, their long-term operational costs are significantly higher. Deterministic classification with predictable latency and explainability is prioritized, though the architecture remains extensible to transformer variants and LLM-based inference. The paper first introduces the deep learning architectures with simulations and model comparisons, then discusses industrialization through serverless architecture, demonstrating automated retraining, prediction, and validation of HS codes. This work provides a replicable blueprint for operationalizing ML using serverless architecture, enabling enterprises to scale while optimizing performance and economics.

On Kinetics-600, we set a new state-of-the-art FVD of 1.3.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D reconstruction-based simulators suffer from rapid accuracy degradation under complex scenarios.

Method: Introduce i-PhysGaussian, a framework that couples 3D Gaussian Splatting with an implicit Material Point Method (MPM) integrator.

Result: i-PhysGaussian maintains stability at up to 20x larger time steps than explicit baselines, preserving structural coherence and smooth motion.

Conclusion: i-PhysGaussian significantly reduces time-step sensitivity and ensures physical consistency.

Abstract: Physical simulation predicts future states of objects based on material properties and external loads, enabling blueprints for both Industry and Engineering to conduct risk management. Current 3D reconstruction-based simulators typically rely on explicit, step-wise updates, which are sensitive to step time and suffer from rapid accuracy degradation under complicated scenarios, such as high-stiffness materials or quasi-static movement. To address this, we introduce i-PhysGaussian, a framework that couples 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with an implicit Material Point Method (MPM) integrator. Unlike explicit methods, our solution obtains an end-of-step state by minimizing a momentum-balance residual through implicit Newton-type optimization with a GMRES solver. This formulation significantly reduces time-step sensitivity and ensures physical consistency. Our results demonstrate that i-PhysGaussian maintains stability at up to 20x larger time steps than explicit baselines, preserving structural coherence and smooth motion even in complex dynamic transitions.

Conclusion: TIFO能够有效解决非平稳时间序列预测中的分布偏移问题，并提高了预测精度和效率。

Abstract: Nonstationary time series forecasting suffers from the distribution shift issue due to the different distributions that produce the training and test data. Existing methods attempt to alleviate the dependence by, e.g., removing low-order moments from each individual sample. These solutions fail to capture the underlying time-evolving structure across samples and do not model the complex time structure. In this paper, we aim to address the distribution shift in the frequency space by considering all possible time structures. To this end, we propose a Time-Invariant Frequency Operator (TIFO), which learns stationarity-aware weights over the frequency spectrum across the entire dataset. The weight representation highlights stationary frequency components while suppressing non-stationary ones, thereby mitigating the distribution shift issue in time series. To justify our method, we show that the Fourier transform of time series data implicitly induces eigen-decomposition in the frequency space. TIFO is a plug-and-play approach that can be seamlessly integrated into various forecasting models. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves 18 top-1 and 6 top-2 results out of 28 forecasting settings. Notably, it yields 33.3% and 55.3% improvements in average MSE on the ETTm2 dataset. In addition, TIFO reduces computational costs by 60% -70% compared to baseline methods, demonstrating strong scalability across diverse forecasting models.

Abstract: Black-box adversarial attacks on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are challenging due to missing gradients and complex multimodal boundaries. While prior state-of-the-art transfer-based approaches like M-Attack perform well using local crop-level matching between source and target images, we find this induces high-variance, nearly orthogonal gradients across iterations, violating coherent local alignment and destabilizing optimization. We attribute this to (i) ViT translation sensitivity that yields spike-like gradients and (ii) structural asymmetry between source and target crops. We reformulate local matching as an asymmetric expectation over source transformations and target semantics, and build a gradient-denoising upgrade to M-Attack. On the source side, Multi-Crop Alignment (MCA) averages gradients from multiple independently sampled local views per iteration to reduce variance. On the target side, Auxiliary Target Alignment (ATA) replaces aggressive target augmentation with a small auxiliary set from a semantically correlated distribution, producing a smoother, lower-variance target manifold. We further reinterpret momentum as Patch Momentum, replaying historical crop gradients; combined with a refined patch-size ensemble (PE+), this strengthens transferable directions. Together these modules form M-Attack-V2, a simple, modular enhancement over M-Attack that substantially improves transfer-based black-box attacks on frontier LVLMs: boosting success rates on Claude-4.0 from 8% to 30%, Gemini-2.5-Pro from 83% to 97%, and GPT-5 from 98% to 100%, outperforming prior black-box LVLM attacks.

Conclusion: VP-VAE和FSP提高了重建保真度，并实现了更平衡的标记使用，同时避免了耦合码本训练的不稳定性。

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental to modern generative modeling, yet they often suffer from training instability and "codebook collapse" due to the inherent coupling of representation learning and discrete codebook optimization. In this paper, we propose VP-VAE (Vector Perturbation VAE), a novel paradigm that decouples representation learning from discretization by eliminating the need for an explicit codebook during training. Our key insight is that, from the neural network's viewpoint, performing quantization primarily manifests as injecting a structured perturbation in latent space. Accordingly, VP-VAE replaces the non-differentiable quantizer with distribution-consistent and scale-adaptive latent perturbations generated via Metropolis--Hastings sampling. This design enables stable training without a codebook while making the model robust to inference-time quantization error. Moreover, under the assumption of approximately uniform latent variables, we derive FSP (Finite Scalar Perturbation), a lightweight variant of VP-VAE that provides a unified theoretical explanation and a practical improvement for FSQ-style fixed quantizers. Extensive experiments on image and audio benchmarks demonstrate that VP-VAE and FSP improve reconstruction fidelity and achieve substantially more balanced token usage, while avoiding the instability inherent to coupled codebook training.

Abstract: Recent time series modeling faces a sharp divide between numerical generation and semantic understanding, with research showing that generation models often rely on superficial pattern matching, while understanding-oriented models struggle with high-fidelity numerical output. Although unified multimodal models (UMMs) have bridged this gap in vision, their potential for time series remains untapped. We propose TimeOmni-VL, the first vision-centric framework that unifies time series understanding and generation through two key innovations: (1) Fidelity-preserving bidirectional mapping between time series and images (Bi-TSI), which advances Time Series-to-Image (TS2I) and Image-to-Time Series (I2TS) conversions to ensure near-lossless transformations. (2) Understanding-guided generation. We introduce TSUMM-Suite, a novel dataset consists of six understanding tasks rooted in time series analytics that are coupled with two generation tasks. With a calibrated Chain-of-Thought, TimeOmni-VL is the first to leverage time series understanding as an explicit control signal for high-fidelity generation. Experiments confirm that this unified approach significantly improves both semantic understanding and numerical precision, establishing a new frontier for multimodal time series modeling.

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的方法ZO-Muon，为零阶优化提供了一个高效的框架

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a gradient-free alternative to first-order (FO) methods by estimating gradients via finite differences of function evaluations, and has recently emerged as a memory-efficient paradigm for fine-tuning large-scale models by avoiding backpropagation. However, ZO optimization has a fundamental tension between accuracy and query efficiency. In this work, we show that ZO optimization can be substantially improved by unifying two complementary principles: (i) a projection-based subspace view that reduces gradient estimation variance by exploiting the intrinsic low-rank structure of model updates, and (ii) Muon-style spectral optimization that applies gradient orthogonalization to extract informative spectral structure from noisy ZO gradients. These findings form a unified framework of subspace gradient orthogonalization, which we instantiate in a new method, ZO-Muon, admitting a natural interpretation as a low-rank Muon optimizer in the ZO setting. Extensive experiments on large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers (ViTs) demonstrate that ZO-Muon significantly accelerates convergence and achieves a win-win improvement in accuracy and query/runtime efficiency. Notably, compared to the popular MeZO baseline, ZO-Muon requires only 24.7% of the queries to reach the same SST-2 performance for LLM fine-tuning, and improves accuracy by 25.1% on ViT-B fine-tuning on CIFAR-100.

Result: 发现三个注意力头（L0H1, L0H5, L1H11）表现出类似布隆过滤器的功能，而第四个注意力头（L3H0）则被重新分类为通用前缀注意力头。这些注意力头形成了一个多分辨率系统，专注于早期层，与归纳和前一个标记头在分类上不同。

Conclusion: 这些注意力头在重复和新型标记处理中都有贡献，表明成员测试与更广泛的计算角色共存。

Abstract: Some transformer attention heads appear to function as membership testers, dedicating themselves to answering the question "has this token appeared before in the context?" We identify these heads across four language models (GPT-2 small, medium, and large; Pythia-160M) and show that they form a spectrum of membership-testing strategies. Two heads (L0H1 and L0H5 in GPT-2 small) function as high-precision membership filters with false positive rates of 0-4\% even at 180 unique context tokens -- well above the $d_\text{head} = 64$ bit capacity of a classical Bloom filter. A third head (L1H11) shows the classic Bloom filter capacity curve: its false positive rate follows the theoretical formula $p \approx (1 - e^{-kn/m})^k$ with $R^2 = 1.0$ and fitted capacity $m \approx 5$ bits, saturating by $n \approx 20$ unique tokens. A fourth head initially identified as a Bloom filter (L3H0) was reclassified as a general prefix-attention head after confound controls revealed its apparent capacity curve was a sequence-length artifact. Together, the three genuine membership-testing heads form a multi-resolution system concentrated in early layers (0-1), taxonomically distinct from induction and previous-token heads, with false positive rates that decay monotonically with embedding distance -- consistent with distance-sensitive Bloom filters. These heads generalize broadly: they respond to any repeated token type, not just repeated names, with 43\% higher generalization than duplicate-token-only heads. Ablation reveals these heads contribute to both repeated and novel token processing, indicating that membership testing coexists with broader computational roles. The reclassification of L3H0 through confound controls strengthens rather than weakens the case: the surviving heads withstand the scrutiny that eliminated a false positive in our own analysis.

Our results illustrate both the similarities and limitations of linear attention relative to quadratic attention in this setting.

Abstract: Robust control of mechanical systems with multiple uncertainties remains a fundamental challenge, particularly when nonlinear dynamics and operating-condition variations are intricately intertwined. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined with domain randomization has shown promise in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, simultaneously handling all sources of uncertainty often leads to sub-optimal policies and poor learning efficiency. This study formulates a new curriculum-based continual learning framework for robust control problems involving nonlinear dynamical systems in which multiple sources of uncertainty are simultaneously superimposed. The key idea is to decompose a complex control problem with multiple uncertainties into a sequence of continual learning tasks, in which strategies for handling each uncertainty are acquired sequentially. The original system is extended into a finite set of plants whose dynamic uncertainties are gradually expanded and diversified as learning progresses. The policy is stably updated across the entire plant sets associated with tasks defined by different uncertainty configurations without catastrophic forgetting. To ensure learning efficiency, we jointly incorporate a model-based controller (MBC), which guarantees a shared baseline performance across the plant sets, into the learning process to accelerate the convergence. This residual learning scheme facilitates task-specific optimization of the DRL agent for each uncertainty, thereby enhancing sample efficiency. As a practical industrial application, this study applies the proposed method to designing an active vibration controller for automotive powertrains. We verified that the resulting controller is robust against structural nonlinearities and dynamic variations, realizing successful sim-to-real transfer.

Result: 实现高达98%的内存减少，支持任意序列长度，全PyTorch autograd集成，并支持Soft-DTW Barycenter计算。

Conclusion: 软dtw-cuda-torch是一个高性能、开源的PyTorch库，用于在GPU上计算SoftDTW。

Abstract: We present softdtw-cuda-torch, an open-source PyTorch library for computing Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SoftDTW) on GPUs. Our implementation addresses three key limitations of existing GPU implementations of SoftDTW: a hard sequence-length cap of 1024, numerical instability in the backward pass for small smoothing parameters, and excessive GPU memory consumption from materializing pairwise distance tensors. We introduce (1) tiled anti-diagonal kernel execution that removes the sequence-length constraint, (2) a log-space back-ward pass that prevents floating-point overflow, and (3) a fused distance-computation mode that eliminates the O(BN M ) intermediate distance tensor, achieving up to 98% memory reduction compared to prior work. The library supports arbitrary sequence lengths, full PyTorch autograd integration, and Soft-DTW Barycenter computation. Code is available at https://github.com/BGU-CS-VIL/sdtw-cuda-torch.

Result: 在三个 EEG 任务和五个基础模型骨干上的实验表明，SCOPE 在标签受限的跨主题设置下，在性能和效率方面均表现出色。

Conclusion: SCOPE 有效地解决了 EEG 基础模型在受限于主题级监督时的泛化问题，提高了模型在标签受限条件下的性能。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models (EFMs) have achieved strong performance under full fine-tuning but exhibit poor generalization when subject-level supervision is limited, a common constraint in real-world clinical settings. We show that this failure stems not merely from limited supervision, but from a structural mismatch between noisy, limited supervision and the highly plastic parameter space of EFMs. To address this challenge, we propose SCOPE, a Structured COnfidence-aware Prototype-guided adaptation framework for EFM fine-tuning. SCOPE follows a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we construct reliable external supervision by learning geometry-regularized task priors, constructing balanced class-level prototypes over the resulting embeddings, and producing confidence-aware pseudo-labels from their agreement to filter unreliable signals on unlabeled data. In the second stage, we introduce ProAdapter, which adapts frozen EEG foundation models via a lightweight adapter conditioned on the structured prototypes. Experiments across three EEG tasks and five foundation model backbones demonstrate that SCOPE consistently achieves strong performance and efficiency under label-limited cross-subject settings.

Abstract: Controlling the longitudinal laser pulse shape in photoinjectors of Free-Electron Lasers is a powerful lever for optimizing electron beam quality, but systematic exploration of the vast design space is limited by the cost of brute-force pulse propagation simulations. We present a generative modeling framework based on Wasserstein Autoencoders to learn a differentiable latent interface between pulse shaping and downstream beam dynamics. Our empirical findings show that the learned latent space is continuous and interpretable while maintaining high-fidelity reconstructions. Pulse families such as higher-order Gaussians trace coherent trajectories, while standardizing the temporal pulse lengths shows a latent organization correlated with pulse energy. Analysis via principal components and Gaussian Mixture Models reveals a well behaved latent geometry, enabling smooth transitions between distinct pulse types via linear interpolation. The model generalizes from simulated data to real experimental pulse measurements, accurately reconstructing pulses and embedding them consistently into the learned manifold. Overall, the approach reduces reliance on expensive pulse-propagation simulations and facilitates downstream beam dynamics simulation and analysis.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on developing models that can autonomously learn optimal decision-making strategies over time. In a recent pioneering paper, Wagner demonstrated how the Deep Cross-Entropy RL method can be applied to tackle various problems from extremal graph theory by reformulating them as combinatorial optimization problems. Subsequently, many researchers became interested in refining and extending the framework introduced by Wagner, thereby creating various RL environments specialized for graph theory. Moreover, a number of problems from extremal graph theory were solved through the use of RL. In particular, several inequalities concerning the Laplacian spectral radius of graphs were refuted, new lower bounds were obtained for certain Ramsey numbers, and contributions were made to the Turán-type extremal problem in which the forbidden structures are cycles of length three and four. Here, we present Reinforcement Learning for Graph Theory (RLGT), a novel RL framework that systematizes the previous work and provides support for both undirected and directed graphs, with or without loops, and with an arbitrary number of edge colors. The framework efficiently represents graphs and aims to facilitate future RL-based research in extremal graph theory through optimized computational performance and a clean and modular design.

Result: 证明了随机分配的隐私损失分布（PLD）可以高效计算，并至少与泊松子采样具有相同的隐私-效用权衡。

Conclusion: 随机分配在DP-SGD训练中比泊松子采样更适合。

Abstract: We consider the privacy amplification properties of a sampling scheme in which a user's data is used in $k$ steps chosen randomly and uniformly from a sequence (or set) of $t$ steps. This sampling scheme has been recently applied in the context of differentially private optimization (Chua et al., 2024a; Choquette-Choo et al., 2025) and communication-efficient high-dimensional private aggregation (Asi et al., 2025), where it was shown to have utility advantages over the standard Poisson sampling. Theoretical analyses of this sampling scheme (Feldman & Shenfeld, 2025; Dong et al., 2025) lead to bounds that are close to those of Poisson sampling, yet still have two significant shortcomings. First, in many practical settings, the resulting privacy parameters are not tight due to the approximation steps in the analysis. Second, the computed parameters are either the hockey stick or Renyi divergence, both of which introduce overheads when used in privacy loss accounting.
  In this work, we demonstrate that the privacy loss distribution (PLD) of random allocation applied to any differentially private algorithm can be computed efficiently. When applied to the Gaussian mechanism, our results demonstrate that the privacy-utility trade-off for random allocation is at least as good as that of Poisson subsampling. In particular, random allocation is better suited for training via DP-SGD. To support these computations, our work develops new tools for general privacy loss accounting based on a notion of PLD realization. This notion allows us to extend accurate privacy loss accounting to subsampling which previously required manual noise-mechanism-specific analysis.

Abstract: Comparative analysis of adaptive immune repertoires at population scale is hampered by two practical bottlenecks: the near-quadratic cost of pairwise affinity evaluations and dataset imbalances that obscure clinically important minority clonotypes. We introduce SubQuad, an end-to-end pipeline that addresses these challenges by combining antigen-aware, near-subquadratic retrieval with GPU-accelerated affinity kernels, learned multimodal fusion, and fairness-constrained clustering. The system employs compact MinHash prefiltering to sharply reduce candidate comparisons, a differentiable gating module that adaptively weights complementary alignment and embedding channels on a per-pair basis, and an automated calibration routine that enforces proportional representation of rare antigen-specific subgroups. On large viral and tumor repertoires SubQuad achieves measured gains in throughput and peak memory usage while preserving or improving recall@k, cluster purity, and subgroup equity. By co-designing indexing, similarity fusion, and equity-aware objectives, SubQuad offers a scalable, bias-aware platform for repertoire mining and downstream translational tasks such as vaccine target prioritization and biomarker discovery.

Conclusion: SIGOOD在21个真实世界数据集上的评估证实了其有效性和优越性。

Abstract: Graph Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection aims to identify whether a test graph deviates from the distribution of graphs observed during training, which is critical for ensuring the reliability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) when deployed in open-world scenarios. Recent advances in graph OOD detection have focused on test-time training techniques that facilitate OOD detection without accessing potential supervisory information (e.g., training data). However, most of these methods employ a one-pass inference paradigm, which prevents them from progressively correcting erroneous predictions to amplify OOD signals. To this end, we propose a \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{I}mproving \textbf{G}raph \textbf{O}ut-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{D}istribution detector (SIGOOD), which is an unsupervised framework that integrates continuous self-learning with test-time training for effective graph OOD detection. Specifically, SIGOOD generates a prompt to construct a prompt-enhanced graph that amplifies potential OOD signals. To optimize prompts, SIGOOD introduces an Energy Preference Optimization (EPO) loss, which leverages energy variations between the original test graph and the prompt-enhanced graph. By iteratively optimizing the prompt by involving it into the detection model in a self-improving loop, the resulting optimal prompt-enhanced graph is ultimately used for OOD detection. Comprehensive evaluations on 21 real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness and outperformance of our SIGOOD method. The code is at https://github.com/Ee1s/SIGOOD.

Result: 2Mamba方法在长上下文长度下比softmax注意力更精确且内存效率更高

Conclusion: 2Mamba方法在保持高精度的同时提高了内存效率

Abstract: Linear attention transformers have become a strong alternative to softmax attention due to their efficiency. However, linear attention tends to be less expressive and results in reduced accuracy compared to softmax attention. To bridge the accuracy gap between softmax attention and linear attention, we manipulate Mamba-2, a very strong linear attention variant. We first simplify Mamba-2 down to its most fundamental and important components, evaluating which specific choices make it most accurate. From this simplified Mamba variant (Mamba-2S), we improve the A-mask and increase the order of the hidden state, resulting in a method, which we call 2Mamba, that is nearly as accurate as softmax attention, yet much more memory efficient for long context lengths. We also investigate elements to Mamba-2 that help surpass softmax attention accuracy. Code is provided for all our experiments

TL;DR: CACTUS是一种新的机器学习框架，旨在解决生物医学数据中的可解释性和鲁棒性问题，通过保持特征稳定性，实现了有竞争力的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物医学数据中，机器学习模型的应用越来越广泛，但其在高风险领域的应用受到鲁棒性差、可解释性有限以及学习到的特征在现实数据扰动（如缺失值）下的不稳定性等挑战的限制。特别是，即使模型在预测性能上取得了很高的成绩，如果其关键特征在数据完整性改变时波动，仍然可能无法赢得信任，从而损害可重复性和下游决策。

Method: 提出了一种名为CACTUS（全面抽象和分类工具，用于揭示结构）的可解释机器学习框架，旨在解决这些问题。CACTUS集成了特征抽象、可解释分类和系统特征稳定性分析，以量化随着数据质量下降，如何保持信息丰富的特征的一致性。使用包含568名患者的真实世界血尿队列，评估膀胱癌，我们将CACTUS与广泛使用的机器学习方法（包括随机森林和梯度提升方法）进行了基准测试，这些方法在随机引入缺失数据的不同水平下进行了测试。

Result: 结果表明，CACTUS在保持特征稳定性的同时，实现了有竞争力的或更优的预测性能，包括在性别分层分析中。特征稳定性提供了与传统性能指标互补的信息，并且对于评估应用于生物医学数据的机器学习模型的可靠性至关重要。通过明确量化对缺失数据的鲁棒性，并优先考虑可解释的、稳定的特征，CACTUS为可靠的数据驱动决策支持提供了一般化的框架。

Conclusion: CACTUS为在生物医学数据中应用的可信机器学习模型提供了一种通用的框架，它通过量化对缺失数据的鲁棒性和优先考虑可解释的、稳定的特征，提高了模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly applied to biomedical data, yet their adoption in high stakes domains remains limited by poor robustness, limited interpretability, and instability of learned features under realistic data perturbations, such as missingness. In particular, models that achieve high predictive performance may still fail to inspire trust if their key features fluctuate when data completeness changes, undermining reproducibility and downstream decision-making. Here, we present CACTUS (Comprehensive Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures), an explainable machine learning framework explicitly designed to address these challenges in small, heterogeneous, and incomplete clinical datasets. CACTUS integrates feature abstraction, interpretable classification, and systematic feature stability analysis to quantify how consistently informative features are preserved as data quality degrades. Using a real-world haematuria cohort comprising 568 patients evaluated for bladder cancer, we benchmark CACTUS against widely used machine learning approaches, including random forests and gradient boosting methods, under controlled levels of randomly introduced missing data. We demonstrate that CACTUS achieves competitive or superior predictive performance while maintaining markedly higher stability of top-ranked features as missingness increases, including in sex-stratified analyses. Our results show that feature stability provides information complementary to conventional performance metrics and is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of machine learning models applied to biomedical data. By explicitly quantifying robustness to missing data and prioritising interpretable, stable features, CACTUS offers a generalizable framework for trustworthy data-driven decision support.

Conclusion: 该方法在代表性ODE/PDE问题上表现优异，与全数据驱动方法或先前灰色盒基线相比，同时保持了物理模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Deep generative models such as flow matching and diffusion models have shown great potential in learning complex distributions and dynamical systems, but often act as black-boxes, neglecting underlying physics. In contrast, physics-based simulation models described by ODEs/PDEs remain interpretable, but may have missing or unknown terms, unable to fully describe real-world observations. We bridge this gap with a novel grey-box method that integrates incomplete physics models directly into generative models. Our approach learns dynamics from observational trajectories alone, without ground-truth physics parameters, in a simulation-free manner that avoids scalability and stability issues of Neural ODEs. The core of our method lies in modelling a structured variational distribution within the flow matching framework, by using two latent encodings: one to model the missing stochasticity and multi-modal velocity, and a second to encode physics parameters as a latent variable with a physics-informed prior. Furthermore, we present an adaptation of the framework to handle second-order dynamics. Our experiments on representative ODE/PDE problems show that our method performs on par with or superior to fully data-driven approaches and previous grey-box baselines, while preserving the interpretability of the physics model.

Abstract: Feedback delays are inevitable in real-world multi-agent learning. They are known to severely degrade performance, and the convergence rate under delayed feedback is still unclear, even for bilinear games. This paper derives the rate of linear convergence of Weighted Optimistic Gradient Descent-Ascent (WOGDA), which predicts future rewards with extra optimism, in unconstrained bilinear games. To analyze the algorithm, we interpret it as an approximation of the Extra Proximal Point (EPP), which is updated based on farther future rewards than the classical Proximal Point (PP). Our theorems show that standard optimism (predicting the next-step reward) achieves linear convergence to the equilibrium at a rate $\exp(-Θ(t/m^{5}))$ after $t$ iterations for delay $m$. Moreover, employing extra optimism (predicting farther future reward) tolerates a larger step size and significantly accelerates the rate to $\exp(-Θ(t/(m^{2}\log m)))$. Our experiments also show accelerated convergence driven by the extra optimism and are qualitatively consistent with our theorems. In summary, this paper validates that extra optimism is a promising countermeasure against performance degradation caused by feedback delays.

Abstract: We introduce CRAFT (Cross-layer Rank Adaptation via Frozen Tucker), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that applies Tucker tensor decomposition to pre-trained attention weight matrices stacked across transformer layers and trains only small square adaptation matrices on the resulting frozen Tucker factors. Existing tensor-based PEFT methods decompose gradient updates: LoTR applies Tucker decomposition with shared factor matrices, while SuperLoRA groups and reshapes $ΔW$ across layers before applying Tucker decomposition. Separately, methods like PiSSA apply SVD to pre-trained weights but operate independently per layer. CRAFT bridges these two lines of work: it performs full Tucker decomposition via Higher-Order SVD (HOSVD) directly on pre-trained weights organized as cross-layer 3D tensors, freezes all resulting factors, and adapts the model through lightweight trainable transformations applied to each factor matrix. Experiments on the GLUE benchmark using RoBERTa-base and RoBERTa-large demonstrate that CRAFT achieves competitive performance with existing methods while requiring only 41K Tucker adaptation parameters--a count independent of model dimension and depth at fixed Tucker ranks.

Conclusion: 本文强调了在ECG表示学习中采用更全面和临床相关的评估标准的重要性，并提出了随机编码器作为基线模型的有力证据。

Abstract: This position paper argues that current benchmarking practice in 12-lead ECG representation learning must be fixed to ensure progress is reliable and aligned with clinically meaningful objectives. The field has largely converged on three public multi-label benchmarks (PTB-XL, CPSC2018, CSN) dominated by arrhythmia and waveform-morphology labels, even though the ECG is known to encode substantially broader clinical information. We argue that downstream evaluation should expand to include an assessment of structural heart disease and patient-level forecasting, in addition to other evolving ECG-related endpoints, as relevant clinical targets. Next, we outline evaluation best practices for multi-label, imbalanced settings, and show that when they are applied, the literature's current conclusion about which representations perform best is altered. Furthermore, we demonstrate the surprising result that a randomly initialized encoder with linear evaluation matches state-of-the-art pre-training on many tasks. This motivates the use of a random encoder as a reasonable baseline model. We substantiate our observations with an empirical evaluation of three representative ECG pre-training approaches across six evaluation settings: the three standard benchmarks, a structural disease dataset, hemodynamic inference, and patient forecasting.

Conclusion: MASPO通过改进梯度利用、平衡探索和信号置信度，解决了现有RLVR算法的挑战

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) algorithms, such as GRPO, rely on rigid, uniform, and symmetric trust region mechanisms that are fundamentally misaligned with the complex optimization dynamics of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we identify three critical challenges in these methods: (1) inefficient gradient utilization caused by the binary cutoff of hard clipping, (2) insensitive probability mass arising from uniform ratio constraints that ignore the token distribution, and (3) asymmetric signal reliability stemming from the disparate credit assignment ambiguity between positive and negative samples. To bridge these gaps, we propose Mass-Adaptive Soft Policy Optimization (MASPO), a unified framework designed to harmonize these three dimensions. MASPO integrates a differentiable soft Gaussian gating to maximize gradient utility, a mass-adaptive limiter to balance exploration across the probability spectrum, and an asymmetric risk controller to align update magnitudes with signal confidence. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MASPO serves as a robust, all-in-one RLVR solution, significantly outperforming strong baselines.

TL;DR: This paper proposes EWC-LoRA, a weight regularization method for low-rank CL, which effectively mitigates task interference and improves the stability-plasticity trade-off in PECL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual Learning (CL) with large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) has recently gained wide attention, shifting the focus from training from scratch to continually adapting PTMs. This has given rise to a promising paradigm: parameter-efficient continual learning (PECL), where task interference is typically mitigated by assigning a task-specific module during training, such as low-rank adapters. However, weight regularization techniques, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)-a key strategy in CL-remain underexplored in this new paradigm.

Method: We revisit weight regularization in low-rank CL as a new perspective for mitigating task interference in PECL. Unlike existing low-rank CL methods, we mitigate task interference by regularizing a shared low-rank update through EWC, thereby keeping the storage requirement and inference costs constant regardless of the number of tasks. Our proposed method EWC-LoRA leverages a low-rank representation to estimate parameter importance over the full-dimensional space.

Result: Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EWC-LoRA, achieving a stability-plasticity trade-off superior to existing low-rank CL approaches. These results indicate that, even under low-rank parameterizations, weight regularization remains an effective mechanism for mitigating task interference.

Conclusion: Our proposed method EWC-LoRA provides a practical, computational- and memory-efficient solution for CL with PTMs, and offers insights that may inform the broader application of regularization techniques within PECL.

Conclusion: The critical role of preprocessing in time series learning and the need for more principled normalization strategies

Abstract: Normalization and scaling are fundamental preprocessing steps in time series modeling, yet their role in Transformer-based models remains underexplored from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we present the first formal analysis of how different normalization strategies, specifically instance-based and global scaling, impact the expressivity of Transformer-based architectures for time series representation learning. We propose a novel expressivity framework tailored to time series, which quantifies a model's ability to distinguish between similar and dissimilar inputs in the representation space. Using this framework, we derive theoretical bounds for two widely used normalization methods: Standard and Min-Max scaling. Our analysis reveals that the choice of normalization strategy can significantly influence the model's representational capacity, depending on the task and data characteristics. We complement our theory with empirical validation on classification and forecasting benchmarks using multiple Transformer-based models. Our results show that no single normalization method consistently outperforms others, and in some cases, omitting normalization entirely leads to superior performance. These findings highlight the critical role of preprocessing in time series learning and motivate the need for more principled normalization strategies tailored to specific tasks and datasets.

Conclusion: 这一发现可以用于向后兼容的模型升级，避免昂贵的重新嵌入，并对学习表示的隐私有影响

Abstract: As models and data scale, independently trained networks often induce analogous notions of similarity. But, matching similarities is weaker than establishing an explicit correspondence between the representation spaces, especially for multimodal models, where consistency must hold not only within each modality, but also for the learned image-text coupling. We therefore ask: given two independently trained multimodal contrastive models (with encoders $(f, g)$ and $(\widetilde{f},\widetilde{g})$) -- trained on different distributions and with different architectures -- does a systematic geometric relationship exist between their embedding spaces? If so, what form does it take, and does it hold uniformly across modalities? In this work, we show that across model families such as CLIP, SigLIP, and FLAVA, this geometric relationship is well approximated by an orthogonal map (up to a global mean shift), i.e., there exists an orthogonal map $Q$ where $Q^\top Q = I$ such that $\widetilde{f}(x)\approx Q f(x)$ for paired images $x$. Strikingly, the same $Q$ simultaneously aligns the text encoders i.e., $\widetilde{g}(y)\approx Q g(y)$ for texts $y$. Theoretically, we prove that if the multimodal kernel agrees across models on a small anchor set i.e. $\langle f(x), g(y)\rangle \approx \langle \widetilde{f}(x), \widetilde{g}(y)\rangle$, then the two models must be related by a single orthogonal map $Q$ and the same $Q$ maps images and text across models. More broadly, this finding enables backward-compatible model upgrades, avoiding costly re-embedding, and has implications for the privacy of learned representations.

Abstract: We study the topology of the loss landscape of one-hidden-layer ReLU networks under overparameterization. On the theory side, we (i) prove that for convex $L$-Lipschitz losses with an $\ell_1$-regularized second layer, every pair of models at the same loss level can be connected by a continuous path within an arbitrarily small loss increase $ε$ (extending a known result for the quadratic loss); (ii) obtain an asymptotic upper bound on the energy gap $ε$ between local and global minima that vanishes as the width $m$ grows, implying that the landscape flattens and sublevel sets become connected in the limit. Empirically, on a synthetic Moons dataset and on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, we measure pairwise energy gaps via Dynamic String Sampling (DSS) and find that wider networks exhibit smaller gaps; in particular, a permutation test on the maximum gap yields $p_{perm}=0$, indicating a clear reduction in the barrier height.

Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）在客户端分散训练机器学习（ML）模型，但中间表示易泄露隐私。

Method: 提出了一种名为k-anonymous不同隐私联邦学习（KD-UFSL）的方法，利用微聚合和差分隐私等技术减少数据泄露。

Result: KD-UFSL在提高平均平方误差的同时，降低了重建图像与实际图像之间的结构相似度，并提高了隐私性。

Conclusion: KD-UFSL提高了隐私性同时保留了全局模型的效用，使其适用于需要平衡隐私和效用的大规模大数据应用。

Abstract: Big data scenarios, where massive, heterogeneous datasets are distributed across clients, demand scalable, privacy-preserving learning methods. Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training of machine learning (ML) models across clients without data centralization. Decentralized training, however, introduces a computational burden on client devices. U-shaped federated split learning (UFSL) offloads a fraction of the client computation to the server while keeping both data and labels on the clients' side. However, the intermediate representations (i.e., smashed data) shared by clients with the server are prone to exposing clients' private data. To reduce exposure of client data through intermediate data representations, this work proposes k-anonymous differentially private UFSL (KD-UFSL), which leverages privacy-enhancing techniques such as microaggregation and differential privacy to minimize data leakage from the smashed data transferred to the server. We first demonstrate that an adversary can access private client data from intermediate representations via a data-reconstruction attack, and then present a privacy-enhancing solution, KD-UFSL, to mitigate this risk. Our experiments indicate that, alongside increasing the mean squared error between the actual and reconstructed images by up to 50% in some cases, KD-UFSL also decreases the structural similarity between them by up to 40% on four benchmarking datasets. More importantly, KD-UFSL improves privacy while preserving the utility of the global model. This highlights its suitability for large-scale big data applications where privacy and utility must be balanced.

TL;DR: VCPO通过控制策略梯度方差，提高了异步RL训练的鲁棒性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对广泛使用的无批评者策略梯度方法（如REINFORCE和GRPO）在异步训练中存在的高方差问题，以及由此导致的梯度噪声和学习不稳定问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为VCPO（方差控制策略优化）的通用稳定方法，该方法通过以下方式解决上述问题：（i）根据有效样本大小调整学习率以抑制不可靠的更新；（ii）在离线设置中应用闭式最小方差基线，避免辅助价值模型并最小化开销。

Result: VCPO在数学、通用推理和工具使用任务上的异步训练中显著提高了鲁棒性，优于多种基线，包括掩码/裁剪稳定器和算法变体。它将长上下文、多轮训练时间减少了2.5倍，同时保持了同步性能，证明了在规模上可靠地控制策略梯度方差对于异步RL至关重要。

Conclusion: VCPO是一种有效的异步RL稳定方法，可以显著提高训练鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to improve large language models on reasoning tasks, and asynchronous RL training is attractive because it increases end-to-end throughput. However, for widely adopted critic-free policy-gradient methods such as REINFORCE and GRPO, high asynchrony makes the policy-gradient estimator markedly $\textbf{higher variance}$: training on stale rollouts creates heavy-tailed importance ratios, causing a small fraction of samples to dominate updates. This amplification makes gradients noisy and learning unstable relative to matched on-policy training. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, we find collapse is reliably predicted by effective sample size (ESS) and unstable gradient norms. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose $\textbf{V}$ariance $\textbf{C}$ontrolled $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{VCPO}$), a general stabilization method for REINFORCE/GRPO-style algorithms that (i) scales learning rate based on effective sample size to dampen unreliable updates, and (ii) applies a closed-form minimum-variance baseline for the off-policy setting, avoiding an auxiliary value model and adding minimal overhead. Empirically, VCPO substantially improves robustness for asynchronous training across math, general reasoning, and tool-use tasks, outperforming a broad suite of baselines spanning masking/clipping stabilizers and algorithmic variants. This reduces long-context, multi-turn training time by 2.5$\times$ while matching synchronous performance, demonstrating that explicit control of policy-gradient variance is key for reliable asynchronous RL at scale.

Conclusion: OSI-FL 在类增量学习和领域增量场景中均优于基线方法，包括传统和一次性联邦学习方法，在三个基准数据集上均取得良好效果。

Abstract: Modern big-data systems generate massive, heterogeneous, and geographically dispersed streams that are large-scale and privacy-sensitive, making centralization challenging. While federated learning (FL) provides a privacy-enhancing training mechanism, it assumes a static data flow and learns a collaborative model over multiple rounds, making learning with \textit{incremental} data challenging in limited-communication scenarios. This paper presents One-Shot Incremental Federated Learning (OSI-FL), the first FL framework that addresses the dual challenges of communication overhead and catastrophic forgetting. OSI-FL communicates category-specific embeddings, devised by a frozen vision-language model (VLM) from each client in a single communication round, which a pre-trained diffusion model at the server uses to synthesize new data similar to the client's data distribution. The synthesized samples are used on the server for training. However, two challenges still persist: i) tasks arriving incrementally need to retrain the global model, and ii) as future tasks arrive, retraining the model introduces catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we augment training with Selective Sample Retention (SSR), which identifies and retains the top-p most informative samples per category and task pair based on sample loss. SSR bounds forgetting by ensuring that representative retained samples are incorporated into training in further iterations. The experimental results indicate that OSI-FL outperforms baselines, including traditional and one-shot FL approaches, in both class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios across three benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Learning time series foundation models has been shown to be a promising approach for zero-shot time series forecasting across diverse time series domains. Insofar as scaling has been a critical driver of performance of foundation models in other modalities such as language and vision, much recent work on time series foundation modeling has focused on scaling. This has resulted in time series foundation models with hundreds of millions of parameters that are, while performant, inefficient and expensive to use in practice. This paper describes a simple recipe for learning efficient foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting that are orders of magnitude smaller. We show that large-scale transformers are not necessary: small hybrid models that interleave long convolution and linear RNN layers (in particular DeltaNet layers) can match the performance of larger transformer-based models while being more than a hundred times smaller. We also describe several data augmentation and inference strategies that further improve performance. This recipe results in Reverso, a family of efficient time series foundation models for zero-shot forecasting that significantly push the performance-efficiency Pareto frontier.

Abstract: Traditional electronic recycling processes suffer from significant resource loss due to inadequate material separation and identification capabilities, limiting material recovery. We present A.R.I.S. (Automated Recycling Identification System), a low-cost, portable sorter for shredded e-waste that addresses this efficiency gap. The system employs a YOLOx model to classify metals, plastics, and circuit boards in real time, achieving low inference latency with high detection accuracy. Experimental evaluation yielded 90% overall precision, 82.2% mean average precision (mAP), and 84% sortation purity. By integrating deep learning with established sorting methods, A.R.I.S. enhances material recovery efficiency and lowers barriers to advanced recycling adoption.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种基于原则的框架，用于确保多轮对话式AI在高风险决策中的可靠性，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: As humans increasingly rely on multiround conversational AI for high stakes decisions, principled frameworks are needed to ensure such interactions reliably improve decision quality. We adopt a human centric view governed by two principles: counterfactual harm, ensuring the AI does not undermine human strengths, and complementarity, ensuring it adds value where the human is prone to err. We formalize these concepts via user defined rules, allowing users to specify exactly what harm and complementarity mean for their specific task. We then introduce an online, distribution free algorithm with finite sample guarantees that enforces the user-specified constraints over the collaboration dynamics. We evaluate our framework across two interactive settings: LLM simulated collaboration on a medical diagnostic task and a human crowdsourcing study on a pictorial reasoning task. We show that our online procedure maintains prescribed counterfactual harm and complementarity violation rates even under nonstationary interaction dynamics. Moreover, tightening or loosening these constraints produces predictable shifts in downstream human accuracy, confirming that the two principles serve as practical levers for steering multi-round collaboration toward better decision quality without the need to model or constrain human behavior.

Motivation: 训练可靠的奖励模型依赖于昂贵且有限的人类标注偏好数据，这促使了数据增强的使用。现有的增强方法通常在表示或语义级别操作，并且对奖励模型的估计难度保持无知。

Method: 提出了一种名为MARS的自适应、边际感知的增强和采样策略，该策略明确针对奖励模型的模糊和故障模式。MARS框架集中在低边际（模糊）偏好对上，这些偏好对中奖励模型最不确定，并通过硬样本增强迭代地细化训练分布。

Result: 理论保证表明，这种策略增加了损失函数的平均曲率，从而增强了信息和条件，以及实验结果表明，与均匀增强相比，该方法在鲁棒奖励建模方面具有一致的优势。

Conclusion: MARS为鲁棒奖励建模提供了一种有效的方法，通过集中增强在奖励模型最不确定的模糊偏好对上，并迭代地细化训练分布。

Abstract: Reward modeling is a core component of modern alignment pipelines including RLHF and RLAIF, underpinning policy optimization methods including PPO and TRPO. However, training reliable reward models relies heavily on human-labeled preference data, which is costly and limited, motivating the use of data augmentation. Existing augmentation approaches typically operate at the representation or semantic level and remain agnostic to the reward model's estimation difficulty. In this paper, we propose MARS, an adaptive, margin-aware augmentation and sampling strategy that explicitly targets ambiguous and failure modes of the reward model. Our proposed framework, MARS, concentrates augmentation on low-margin (ambiguous) preference pairs where the reward model is most uncertain, and iteratively refines the training distribution via hard-sample augmentation. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that this strategy increases the average curvature of the loss function hence enhance information and improves conditioning, along with empirical results demonstrating consistent gains over uniform augmentation for robust reward modeling.

Motivation: 评估广泛使用的AI安全数据集的质量

Method: 从独立和实际两个角度评估数据集，引入'意图洗白'程序

Result: 当前AI安全数据集无法真实反映现实世界攻击，过度依赖触发线索，导致评估与现实攻击行为脱节

Conclusion: 模型安全评估与现实攻击行为之间存在显著差距

Abstract: We systematically evaluate the quality of widely used AI safety datasets from two perspectives: in isolation and in practice. In isolation, we examine how well these datasets reflect real-world attacks based on three key properties: driven by ulterior intent, well-crafted, and out-of-distribution. We find that these datasets overrely on "triggering cues": words or phrases with overt negative/sensitive connotations that are intended to trigger safety mechanisms explicitly, which is unrealistic compared to real-world attacks. In practice, we evaluate whether these datasets genuinely measure safety risks or merely provoke refusals through triggering cues. To explore this, we introduce "intent laundering": a procedure that abstracts away triggering cues from attacks (data points) while strictly preserving their malicious intent and all relevant details. Our results indicate that current AI safety datasets fail to faithfully represent real-world attacks due to their overreliance on triggering cues. In fact, once these cues are removed, all previously evaluated "reasonably safe" models become unsafe, including Gemini 3 Pro and Claude Sonnet 3.7. Moreover, when intent laundering is adapted as a jailbreaking technique, it consistently achieves high attack success rates, ranging from 90% to over 98%, under fully black-box access. Overall, our findings expose a significant disconnect between how model safety is evaluated and how real-world adversaries behave.

Motivation: 检测生产发布前的漏洞，测试基于评论的操纵是否会导致LLM在漏洞检测中的误导。

Method: 构建包含Python、JavaScript和Java的100个样本基准，每个样本配对8种评论变体，包括无评论和对抗策略如权威欺骗和技术欺骗。评估8个前沿模型，包括5个商业和3个开源模型，在9366次试验中进行评估。

Result: 对抗性评论对检测准确率的影响很小（McNemar精确p>0.21；所有95%置信区间均包含零）。这适用于具有89-96%基线检测率的商业模型和具有53-72%基线检测率的开源模型，尽管绝对性能差距很大。与生成设置不同，评论操纵在攻击成功方面取得很高的成绩，但检测性能没有明显下降。更复杂的对抗策略并不比简单的操纵性评论更有优势。测试了4种自动化防御措施，在4,646次额外试验中（总计14,012次）。静态分析交叉引用在检测方面表现最佳，达到96.9%，并恢复了47%的基线遗漏。评论剥离通过删除有用的上下文降低了较弱模型的检测率。失败主要集中在固有的困难漏洞类别上，包括竞争条件、时间侧通道和复杂的授权逻辑，而不是对抗性评论。

Conclusion: 对抗性评论对LLM在漏洞检测中的影响很小，复杂的对抗策略并不比简单的操纵性评论更有优势。

Abstract: AI-assisted code review is widely used to detect vulnerabilities before production release. Prior work shows that adversarial prompt manipulation can degrade large language model (LLM) performance in code generation. We test whether similar comment-based manipulation misleads LLMs during vulnerability detection. We build a 100-sample benchmark across Python, JavaScript, and Java, each paired with eight comment variants ranging from no comments to adversarial strategies such as authority spoofing and technical deception. Eight frontier models, five commercial and three open-source, are evaluated in 9,366 trials. Adversarial comments produce small, statistically non-significant effects on detection accuracy (McNemar exact p > 0.21; all 95 percent confidence intervals include zero). This holds for commercial models with 89 to 96 percent baseline detection and open-source models with 53 to 72 percent, despite large absolute performance gaps. Unlike generation settings where comment manipulation achieves high attack success, detection performance does not meaningfully degrade. More complex adversarial strategies offer no advantage over simple manipulative comments. We test four automated defenses across 4,646 additional trials (14,012 total). Static analysis cross-referencing performs best at 96.9 percent detection and recovers 47 percent of baseline misses. Comment stripping reduces detection for weaker models by removing helpful context. Failures concentrate on inherently difficult vulnerability classes, including race conditions, timing side channels, and complex authorization logic, rather than on adversarial comments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful re-rankers. Recent research has however showed that simple prompt injections embedded within a candidate document (i.e., jailbreak prompt attacks) can significantly alter an LLM's ranking decisions. While this poses serious security risks to LLM-based ranking pipelines, the extent to which this vulnerability persists across diverse LLM families, architectures, and settings remains largely under-explored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study of jailbreak prompt attacks against LLM rankers. We focus our evaluation on two complementary tasks: (1) Preference Vulnerability Assessment, measuring intrinsic susceptibility via attack success rate (ASR); and (2) Ranking Vulnerability Assessment, quantifying the operational impact on the ranking's quality (nDCG@10). We systematically examine three prevalent ranking paradigms (pairwise, listwise, setwise) under two injection variants: decision objective hijacking and decision criteria hijacking. Beyond reproducing prior findings, we expand the analysis to cover vulnerability scaling across model families, position sensitivity, backbone architectures, and cross-domain robustness. Our results characterize the boundary conditions of these vulnerabilities, revealing critical insights such as that encoder-decoder architectures exhibit strong inherent resilience to jailbreak attacks. We publicly release our code and additional experimental results at https://github.com/ielab/LLM-Ranker-Attack.

Method: 设计并实施NESSiE基准测试，包括信息安全和访问安全的最小测试案例。

Result: 发现现有LLMs在NESSiE基准测试中未达到100%的通过率，表明存在安全相关的问题。提出Safe & Helpful (SH)指标以比较安全性和帮助性。发现某些模型在禁用推理和良性干扰情境下表现不佳。

Conclusion: NESSiE是评估LLMs安全性的必要基准，但现有LLMs仍存在安全问题。

Abstract: We introduce NESSiE, the NEceSsary SafEty benchmark for large language models (LLMs). With minimal test cases of information and access security, NESSiE reveals safety-relevant failures that should not exist, given the low complexity of the tasks. NESSiE is intended as a lightweight, easy-to-use sanity check for language model safety and, as such, is not sufficient for guaranteeing safety in general -- but we argue that passing this test is necessary for any deployment. However, even state-of-the-art LLMs do not reach 100% on NESSiE and thus fail our necessary condition of language model safety, even in the absence of adversarial attacks. Our Safe & Helpful (SH) metric allows for direct comparison of the two requirements, showing models are biased toward being helpful rather than safe. We further find that disabled reasoning for some models, but especially a benign distraction context degrade model performance. Overall, our results underscore the critical risks of deploying such models as autonomous agents in the wild. We make the dataset, package and plotting code publicly available.

Abstract: We present a practical system for privacy-aware large language model (LLM) inference that splits a transformer between a trusted local GPU and an untrusted cloud GPU, communicating only intermediate activations over the network. Our system addresses the unique challenges of autoregressive LLM decoding over high-latency wide-area networks (WANs), contributing: (1) an asymmetric layer split where embedding and unembedding layers remain local, ensuring raw tokens never leave the trusted device; (2) the first application of lookahead decoding to split inference over WANs, amortizing network round-trip latency across multiple tokens per iteration; (3) an empirical inversion attack evaluation showing that split depth provides a tunable privacy-performance tradeoff -- an attacker can recover ~59%% of tokens at a 2-layer split but only ~35%% at an 8-layer split, with minimal throughput impact; (4) ablation experiments showing that n-gram speculation accepts 1.2-1.3 tokens per decoding step on average (peak of 7 observed on code), with acceptance rates consistent across model scales; (5) formal verification that lookahead decoding produces token-identical output to sequential decoding under greedy argmax, with zero quality degradation; and (6) scaling validation on Mistral NeMo 12B (40 layers), demonstrating that the system generalizes to larger models with only 4.9 GB local VRAM and matching 7B throughput. Evaluated on Mistral 7B and NeMo 12B over a ~80ms WAN link, our system achieves 8.7-9.3 tok/s (7B) and 7.8-8.7 tok/s (12B) with lookahead decoding, with an RTT decomposition model (validated at <6.2%% cross-validation error) projecting 15-19 tok/s at 20ms RTT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大型语言模型（LLMs）部署中的安全问题，现有的方法通常依赖于重量级的微调，这导致更新、审计和维护成本高昂。

Method: 提出了一种名为NeST的轻量级、结构感知安全对齐框架，通过选择性地调整一小部分与安全相关的神经元，同时冻结模型的其余部分，来加强拒绝行为。NeST通过聚类功能上协调的安全神经元并在每个簇内执行共享更新，将参数更新与安全行为的内部组织对齐，从而实现有针对性的稳定安全适应，而无需广泛修改模型或推理时间开销。

Result: 在所有评估的模型中，NeST将攻击成功率从平均44.5%降低到4.36%，相当于不安全生成的90.2%减少，而平均仅需要440万个可训练参数。这比全微调减少了17,310倍的更新参数，比LoRA减少了9.25倍，同时始终实现更强的安全性能。

Conclusion: NeST在减少不安全生成和参数需求方面表现出色，为LLMs的安全部署提供了一种有效的方法。

Abstract: Safety alignment is essential for the responsible deployment of large language models (LLMs). Yet, existing approaches often rely on heavyweight fine-tuning that is costly to update, audit, and maintain across model families. Full fine-tuning incurs substantial computational and storage overhead, while parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA trade efficiency for inconsistent safety gains and sensitivity to design choices. Safety intervention mechanisms such as circuit breakers reduce unsafe outputs without modifying model weights, but do not directly shape or preserve the internal representations that govern safety behavior. These limitations hinder rapid and reliable safety updates, particularly in settings where models evolve frequently or must adapt to new policies and domains.
  We present NeST, a lightweight, structure-aware safety alignment framework that strengthens refusal behavior by selectively adapting a small subset of safety-relevant neurons while freezing the remainder of the model. NeST aligns parameter updates with the internal organization of safety behavior by clustering functionally coherent safety neurons and enforcing shared updates within each cluster, enabling targeted and stable safety adaptation without broad model modification or inference-time overhead. We benchmark NeST against three dominant baselines: full fine-tuning, LoRA-based fine-tuning, and circuit breakers across 10 open-weight LLMs spanning multiple model families and sizes. Across all evaluated models, NeST reduces the attack success rate from an average of 44.5% to 4.36%, corresponding to a 90.2% reduction in unsafe generations, while requiring only 0.44 million trainable parameters on average. This amounts to a 17,310x decrease in updated parameters compared to full fine-tuning and a 9.25x reduction relative to LoRA, while consistently achieving stronger safety performance for alignment.

TL;DR: 为了解决大型语言模型推理中的隐私和可验证性问题，我们提出了一种新的方法，通过添加少量额外的计算成本，实现了对推理过程的验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的规模不断扩大，越来越多的用户无法在本地托管和运行模型。这导致了第三方托管服务的使用增加。然而，在这种设置中，对推理提供者执行的计算没有保证。例如，一个不诚实的提供者可能会用一个更便宜运行的较弱模型来替换一个昂贵的模型，并将较弱模型的输出返回给用户。现有的验证推理工具通常依赖于密码学方法，如零知识证明（ZKPs），但这些方法增加了显著的计算开销，并且对于大型模型来说仍然不可行。

Method: 提出两种新的协议，利用隐私保护的大型语言模型推理，以提供对执行的推理保证。这些方法成本较低，只需添加一些额外的计算令牌，并且对下游几乎没有影响。

Result: 该工作提供了对隐私和可验证性在LLM推理之间联系的新见解。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的隐私保护推理方法，提高了验证效率，并为LLM推理中的隐私和可验证性提供了新的见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in size, fewer users are able to host and run models locally. This has led to increased use of third-party hosting services. However, in this setting, there is a lack of guarantees on the computation performed by the inference provider. For example, a dishonest provider may replace an expensive large model with a cheaper-to-run weaker model and return the results from the weaker model to the user. Existing tools to verify inference typically rely on methods from cryptography such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), but these add significant computational overhead, and remain infeasible for use for large models. In this work, we develop a new insight -- that given a method for performing private LLM inference, one can obtain forms of verified inference at marginal extra cost. Specifically, we propose two new protocols which leverage privacy-preserving LLM inference in order to provide guarantees over the inference that was carried out. Our approaches are cheap, requiring the addition of a few extra tokens of computation, and have little to no downstream impact. As the fastest privacy-preserving inference methods are typically faster than ZK methods, the proposed protocols also improve verification runtime. Our work provides novel insights into the connections between privacy and verifiability in LLM inference.

Motivation: 传统的密码学安全性是基于基于游戏或模拟的定义。本文提出了一种基于格罗滕迪克拓扑和层理论的密码学安全性的结构重构。

Method: 使用格罗滕迪克拓扑和层理论建模攻击者的观察，将协议记录自然地形成层，安全属性作为几何条件出现。

Conclusion: 层理论视角为基于模拟的安全性提供了一个概念性解释，并为进一步的密码学抽象提供了一个几何基础。

Abstract: Cryptographic security is traditionally formulated using game-based or simulation-based definitions. In this paper, we propose a structural reformulation of cryptographic security based on Grothendieck topologies and sheaf theory.
  Our key idea is to model attacker observations as a Grothendieck site, where covering families represent admissible decompositions of partial information determined by efficient simulation. Within this framework, protocol transcripts naturally form sheaves, and security properties arise as geometric conditions.
  As a first step, we focus on $Σ$-protocols. We show that the transcript structure of any $Σ$-protocol defines a torsor in the associated topos of sheaves. Local triviality of this torsor corresponds to zero-knowledge, while the absence of global sections reflects soundness. A concrete analysis of the Schnorr $Σ$-protocol is provided to illustrate the construction.
  This sheaf-theoretic perspective offers a conceptual explanation of simulation-based security and suggests a geometric foundation for further cryptographic abstractions.

Motivation: 为了证明Fischlin变换在量子随机预言模型（QROM）中保持直线性可提取性，

Method: 通过压缩预言模型（压缩Oracle）的方法，使用尾界限、马尔可夫链以及对称化、查询振幅和量子并集界限等技巧。

Result: 证明了Fischlin变换在QROM中保持直线性可提取性，提供了比Pass变换更小的证明大小。

Conclusion: 这确立了Fischlin变换的后量子安全性，为后量子安全提供了直线性可提取的无交互零知识证明的替代方案。

Abstract: The Fischlin transform yields non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs with straight-line extractability in the classical random oracle model. This is done by forcing a prover to generate multiple accepting transcripts through a proof-of-work mechanism. Whether the Fischlin transform is straight-line extractable against quantum adversaries has remained open due to the difficulty of reasoning about the likelihood of query transcripts in the quantum-accessible random oracle model (QROM), even when using the compressed oracle methodology. In this work, we prove that the Fischlin transform remains straight-line extractable in the QROM, via an extractor based on the compressed oracle. This establishes the post-quantum security of the Fischlin transform, providing a post-quantum straight-line extractable NIZK alternative to Pass' transform with smaller proof size. Our techniques include tail bounds for sums of independent random variables and for martingales as well as symmetrization, query amplitude and quantum union bound arguments.

Result: 确定了四个核心观点，解释了为什么实体系列AI难以保证安全性，并提出了相应的安全策略。

Conclusion: 保障实体系列AI的安全需要从组件级防御转向系统级推理，关注物理风险、不确定性和故障传播。

Abstract: Embodied AI systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles, service robots, and LLM-driven interactive agents) are rapidly transitioning from controlled environments to safety critical real-world deployments. Unlike disembodied AI, failures in embodied intelligence lead to irreversible physical consequences, raising fundamental questions about security, safety, and reliability. While existing research predominantly analyzes embodied AI through the lenses of Large Language Model (LLM) vulnerabilities or classical Cyber-Physical System (CPS) failures, this survey argues that these perspectives are individually insufficient to explain many observed breakdowns in modern embodied systems. We posit that a significant class of failures arises from embodiment-induced system-level mismatches, rather than from isolated model flaws or traditional CPS attacks. Specifically, we identify four core insights that explain why embodied AI is fundamentally harder to secure: (i) semantic correctness does not imply physical safety, as language-level reasoning abstracts away geometry, dynamics, and contact constraints; (ii) identical actions can lead to drastically different outcomes across physical states due to nonlinear dynamics and state uncertainty; (iii) small errors propagate and amplify across tightly coupled perception-decision-action loops; and (iv) safety is not compositional across time or system layers, enabling locally safe decisions to accumulate into globally unsafe behavior. These insights suggest that securing embodied AI requires moving beyond component-level defenses toward system-level reasoning about physical risk, uncertainty, and failure propagation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在当前的组织间数据空间中，使用策略主要在资产级别执行：整个文档或数据集要么共享，要么保留。当文档的部分内容敏感时，想要避免泄露受保护信息的提供者通常必须手动编辑文档才能共享，这既昂贵又粗糙，难以维护，因为策略或合作伙伴发生变化。

Method: 提出DAVE，一个使用策略执行LLM代言人，代表数据提供者回答关于私有文档的问题。不发布文档，而是提供自然语言界面，其响应受机器可读的使用策略约束。

Result: 我们正式化了此设置中的策略违规信息泄露，借鉴了使用控制和信息流安全，并引入了虚拟编辑：在不修改源文档的情况下，在查询时抑制敏感信息。我们描述了一个将此类代言人集成到Eclipse Dataspace组件和ODRL风格的策略中的架构，并概述了一个初始的提供者端集成原型，其中QA请求通过代言人服务路由，而不是触发原始文档传输。

Conclusion: 我们的主要贡献是架构性的：我们尚未实现或经验性地评估完整的执行管道。因此，我们概述了一种评估方法，以评估在良性和敌对查询下的安全性、效用和性能权衡，作为未来对系统治理的LLM访问多党数据空间的实证工作的基础。

Abstract: In current inter-organizational data spaces, usage policies are enforced mainly at the asset level: a whole document or dataset is either shared or withheld. When only parts of a document are sensitive, providers who want to avoid leaking protected information typically must manually redact documents before sharing them, which is costly, coarse-grained, and hard to maintain as policies or partners change. We present DAVE, a usage policy-enforcing LLM spokesperson that answers questions over private documents on behalf of a data provider. Instead of releasing documents, the provider exposes a natural language interface whose responses are constrained by machine-readable usage policies. We formalize policy-violating information disclosure in this setting, drawing on usage control and information flow security, and introduce virtual redaction: suppressing sensitive information at query time without modifying source documents. We describe an architecture for integrating such a spokesperson with Eclipse Dataspace Components and ODRL-style policies, and outline an initial provider-side integration prototype in which QA requests are routed through a spokesperson service instead of triggering raw document transfer. Our contribution is primarily architectural: we do not yet implement or empirically evaluate the full enforcement pipeline. We therefore outline an evaluation methodology to assess security, utility, and performance trade-offs under benign and adversarial querying as a basis for future empirical work on systematically governed LLM access to multi-party data spaces.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present Jolt Atlas, a zero-knowledge machine learning (zkML) framework that extends the Jolt proving system to model inference. Unlike zkVMs (zero-knowledge virtual machines), which emulate CPU instruction execution, Jolt Atlas adapts Jolt's lookup-centric approach and applies it directly to ONNX tensor operations. The ONNX computational model eliminates the need for CPU registers and simplifies memory consistency verification. In addition, ONNX is an open-source, portable format, which makes it easy to share and deploy models across different frameworks, hardware platforms, and runtime environments without requiring framework-specific conversions.
  Our lookup arguments, which use sumcheck protocol, are well-suited for non-linear functions -- key building blocks in modern ML. We apply optimisations such as neural teleportation to reduce the size of lookup tables while preserving model accuracy, as well as several tensor-level verification optimisations detailed in this paper. We demonstrate that Jolt Atlas can prove model inference in memory-constrained environments -- a prover property commonly referred to as \textit{streaming}. Furthermore, we discuss how Jolt Atlas achieves zero-knowledge through the BlindFold technique, as introduced in Vega. In contrast to existing zkML frameworks, we show practical proving times for classification, embedding, automated reasoning, and small language models.
  Jolt Atlas enables cryptographic verification that can be run on-device, without specialised hardware. The resulting proofs are succinctly verifiable. This makes Jolt Atlas well-suited for privacy-centric and adversarial environments. In a companion work, we outline various use cases of Jolt Atlas, including how it serves as guardrails in agentic commerce and for trustless AI context (often referred to as \textit{AI memory}).

Result: 审计12个开源库，发现13个影响其理论保证的隐私违规。

Conclusion: Re:cord-play是一种有效的DP审计方法，有助于提高DP实现的可靠性。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) implementations are notoriously prone to errors, with subtle bugs frequently invalidating theoretical guarantees. Existing verification methods are often impractical: formal tools are too restrictive, while black-box statistical auditing is intractable for complex pipelines and fails to pinpoint the source of the bug. This paper introduces Re:cord-play, a gray-box auditing paradigm that inspects the internal state of DP algorithms. By running an instrumented algorithm on neighboring datasets with identical randomness, Re:cord-play directly checks for data-dependent control flow and provides concrete falsification of sensitivity violations by comparing declared sensitivity against the empirically measured distance between internal inputs. We generalize this to Re:cord-play-sample, a full statistical audit that isolates and tests each component, including untrusted ones. We show that our novel testing approach is both effective and necessary by auditing 12 open-source libraries, including SmartNoise SDK, Opacus, and Diffprivlib, and uncovering 13 privacy violations that impact their theoretical guarantees. We release our framework as an open-source Python package, thereby making it easy for DP developers to integrate effective, computationally inexpensive, and seamless privacy testing as part of their software development lifecycle.

Conclusion: 我们的发现描述了CTI生态系统中固有的结构偏差，使从业者和研究人员能够更好地评估其情报来源的完整性。

Abstract: Despite the high volume of open-source Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), our understanding of long-term threat actor-victim dynamics remains fragmented due to the lack of structured datasets and inconsistent reporting standards. In this paper, we present a large-scale automated analysis of open-source CTI reports spanning two decades. We develop a high-precision, LLM-based pipeline to ingest and structure 13,308 reports, extracting key entities such as attributed threat actors, motivations, victims, reporting vendors, and technical indicators (IoCs and TTPs). Our analysis quantifies the evolution of CTI information density and specialization, characterizing patterns that relate specific threat actors to motivations and victim profiles. Furthermore, we perform a meta-analysis of the CTI industry itself. We identify a fragmented ecosystem of distinct silos where vendors demonstrate significant geographic and sectoral reporting biases. Our marginal coverage analysis reveals that intelligence overlap between vendors is typically low: while a few core providers may offer broad situational awareness, additional sources yield diminishing returns. Overall, our findings characterize the structural biases inherent in the CTI ecosystem, enabling practitioners and researchers to better evaluate the completeness of their intelligence sources.

Motivation: 在基于代币的支付系统中，如加密货币或央行数字货币（CBDCs），选择一组代币来资助交易是一个问题。

Conclusion: Boltzmann Draw在上述目标方面优于标准随机抽取和贪婪算法。

Abstract: Coin selection refers to the problem of choosing a set of tokens to fund a transaction in token-based payment systems such as, e.g., cryptocurrencies or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). In this paper, we propose the Boltzmann Draw that is a probabilistic algorithm inspired by the principles of statistical physics. The algorithm relies on drawing tokens according to the Boltzmann distribution, serving as an extension and improvement of the Random Draw method. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in bounding the number of selected input tokens as well as reducing dust generation and limiting the token pool size in the wallet. Moreover, the probabilistic algorithm can be implemented efficiently, improves performance and respects privacy requirements - properties of significant relevance for current token-based technologies. We compare the Boltzmann draw to both the standard Random Draw and the Greedy algorithm. We argue that the former is superior to the latter in the sense of the above objectives. Our findings are relevant for token-based technologies, and are also of interest for CBDCs, which as a legal tender possibly needs to handle large transaction volumes at a high frequency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A recent breakthrough [Hirahara and Nanashima, STOC'2024] established that if $\mathsf{NP} \not \subseteq \mathsf{ioP/poly}$, the existence of zero-knowledge with negligible errors for $\mathsf{NP}$ implies the existence of one-way functions (OWFs). In this work, we obtain a characterization of one-way functions from the worst-case complexity of zero-knowledge {\em in the high-error regime}.
  We say that a zero-knowledge argument is {\em non-trivial} if the sum of its completeness, soundness and zero-knowledge errors is bounded away from $1$. Our results are as follows, assuming $\mathsf{NP} \not \subseteq \mathsf{ioP/poly}$:
  1. {\em Non-trivial} Non-Interactive ZK (NIZK) arguments for $\mathsf{NP}$ imply the existence of OWFs. Using known amplification techniques, this result also provides an unconditional transformation from weak to standard NIZK proofs for all meaningful error parameters.
  2. We also generalize to the interactive setting: {\em Non-trivial} constant-round public-coin zero-knowledge arguments for $\mathsf{NP}$ imply the existence of OWFs, and therefore also (standard) four-message zero-knowledge arguments for $\mathsf{NP}$.
  Prior to this work, one-way functions could be obtained from NIZKs that had constant zero-knowledge error $ε_{zk}$ and soundness error $ε_{s}$ satisfying $ε_{zk} + \sqrt{ε_{s}} < 1$ [Chakraborty, Hulett and Khurana, CRYPTO'2025]. However, the regime where $ε_{zk} + \sqrt{ε_{s}} \geq 1$ remained open. This work closes the gap, and obtains new implications in the interactive setting. Our results and techniques could be useful stepping stones in the quest to construct one-way functions from worst-case hardness.

Conclusion: PMNL算法在考虑到达率与组合和定价的依赖关系方面表现出色，能够有效学习客户选择和到达模型，并提供了优于其他假设固定到达率的决策。

Abstract: We study dynamic joint assortment and pricing where a seller updates decisions at regular accounting/operating intervals to maximize the cumulative per-period revenue over a horizon $T$. In many settings, assortment and prices affect not only what an arriving customer buys but also how many customers arrive within the period, whereas classical multinomial logit (MNL) models assume arrivals as fixed, potentially leading to suboptimal decisions. We propose a Poisson-MNL model that couples a contextual MNL choice model with a Poisson arrival model whose rate depends on the offered assortment and prices. Building on this model, we develop an efficient algorithm PMNL based on the idea of upper confidence bound (UCB). We establish its (near) optimality by proving a non-asymptotic regret bound of order $\sqrt{T\log{T}}$ and a matching lower bound (up to $\log T$). Simulation studies underscore the importance of accounting for the dependency of arrival rates on assortment and pricing: PMNL effectively learns customer choice and arrival models and provides joint assortment-pricing decisions that outperform others that assume fixed arrival rates.

Abstract: The problem of domain generalization concerns learning predictive models that are robust to distribution shifts when deployed in new, previously unseen environments. Existing methods typically require labeled data from multiple training environments, limiting their applicability when labeled data are scarce. In this work, we study domain generalization in an anti-causal setting, where the outcome causes the observed covariates. Under this structure, environment perturbations that affect the covariates do not propagate to the outcome, which motivates regularizing the model's sensitivity to these perturbations. Crucially, estimating these perturbation directions does not require labels, enabling us to leverage unlabeled data from multiple environments. We propose two methods that penalize the model's sensitivity to variations in the mean and covariance of the covariates across environments, respectively, and prove that these methods have worst-case optimality guarantees under certain classes of environments. Finally, we demonstrate the empirical performance of our approach on a controlled physical system and a physiological signal dataset.

Result: MGD通过解决一个随机微分方程来采样最大熵分布，该方程指导矩在有限时间内趋向于指定的值，从而避免了基于平衡的方法中的缓慢混合。

Conclusion: 在大型波动极限下，MGD收敛到最大熵分布，并推导出一个可处理的熵估计量，该估计量直接从动力学中计算得出。

Abstract: Generating samples from limited information is a fundamental problem across scientific domains. Classical maximum entropy methods provide principled uncertainty quantification from moment constraints but require sampling via MCMC or Langevin dynamics, which typically exhibit exponential slowdown in high dimensions. In contrast, generative models based on diffusion and flow matching efficiently transport noise to data but offer limited theoretical guarantees and can overfit when data is scarce. We introduce Moment Guided Diffusion (MGD), which combines elements of both approaches. Building on the stochastic interpolant framework, MGD samples maximum entropy distributions by solving a stochastic differential equation that guides moments toward prescribed values in finite time, thereby avoiding slow mixing in equilibrium-based methods. We formally obtain, in the large-volatility limit, convergence of MGD to the maximum entropy distribution and derive a tractable estimator of the resulting entropy computed directly from the dynamics. Applications to financial time series, turbulent flows, and cosmological fields using wavelet scattering moments yield estimates of negentropy for high-dimensional multiscale processes.

Abstract: Efficient estimation of causal and structural parameters can be automated using the Riesz representation theorem and debiased machine learning (DML). We present genriesz, an open-source Python package that implements automatic DML and generalized Riesz regression, a unified framework for estimating Riesz representers by minimizing empirical Bregman divergences. This framework includes covariate balancing, nearest-neighbor matching, calibrated estimation, and density ratio estimation as special cases. A key design principle of the package is automatic regressor balancing (ARB): given a Bregman generator $g$ and a representer model class, genriesz} automatically constructs a compatible link function so that the generalized Riesz regression estimator satisfies balancing (moment-matching) optimality conditions in a user-chosen basis. The package provides a modulr interface for specifying (i) the target linear functional via a black-box evaluation oracle, (ii) the representer model via basis functions (polynomial, RKHS approximations, random forest leaf encodings, neural embeddings, and a nearest-neighbor catchment basis), and (iii) the Bregman generator, with optional user-supplied derivatives. It returns regression adjustment (RA), Riesz weighting (RW), augmented Riesz weighting (ARW), and TMLE-style estimators with cross-fitting, confidence intervals, and $p$-values. We highlight representative workflows for estimation problems such as the average treatment effect (ATE), ATE on treated (ATT), and average marginal effect estimation.

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a powerful technique for resolving the three-dimensional structures of macromolecules. A key challenge in cryo-EM is characterizing continuous heterogeneity, where molecules adopt a continuum of conformational states. Covariance-based methods offer a principled approach to modeling structural variability. However, estimating the covariance matrix efficiently remains a challenging computational task. In this paper, we present SOLVAR (Stochastic Optimization for Low-rank Variability Analysis), which leverages a low-rank assumption on the covariance matrix to provide a tractable estimator for its principal components, despite the apparently prohibitive large size of the covariance matrix. Under this low-rank assumption, our estimator can be formulated as an optimization problem that can be solved quickly and accurately. Moreover, our framework enables refinement of the poses of the input particle images, a capability absent from most heterogeneity-analysis methods, and all covariance-based methods. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and experimental datasets demonstrate that the algorithm accurately captures dominant components of variability while maintaining computational efficiency. SOLVAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets in a recent heterogeneity benchmark. The code of the algorithm is freely available at https://github.com/RoeyYadgar/SOLVAR.

Conclusion: 标签聚类CP有助于控制方法驱动的不公平性，LLM-in-the-loop评估器有助于评估实质性公平性。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) offers distribution-free uncertainty quantification for machine learning models, yet its interplay with fairness in downstream decision-making remains underexplored. Moving beyond CP as a standalone operation (procedural fairness), we analyze the holistic decision-making pipeline to evaluate substantive fairness-the equity of downstream outcomes. Theoretically, we derive an upper bound that decomposes prediction-set size disparity into interpretable components, clarifying how label-clustered CP helps control method-driven contributions to unfairness. To facilitate scalable empirical analysis, we introduce an LLM-in-the-loop evaluator that approximates human assessment of substantive fairness across diverse modalities. Our experiments reveal that label-clustered CP variants consistently deliver superior substantive fairness. Finally, we empirically show that equalized set sizes, rather than coverage, strongly correlate with improved substantive fairness, enabling practitioners to design more fair CP systems.

Result: RSA易受Shor算法攻击，BB84在理想条件下实现完整密钥协商，并能高精度检测窃听。

Conclusion: 提出了一种混合安全框架，以确保后量子时代的数据保护。

Abstract: Quantum computing is a significant risk to classical cryptographic, especially RSA, which depends on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. Classical factorization methods, such as Trial Division and Pollard's Rho, are inefficient for large keys, while Shor's quantum algorithm can break RSA efficiently in polynomial time. This research studies RSA's vulnerabilities under both classical and quantum attacks and designs a hybrid security framework to ensure data protection in the post-quantum era. The conceptual framework combines AES encryption for classical security, BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for secure key exchange with eavesdropping detection, quantum state comparison for lightweight authentication, and a bio-inspired immune system for adaptive threat detection. RSA is vulnerable to Shor's algorithm, BB84 achieves full key agreement in ideal conditions, and it detects eavesdropping with high accuracy. The conceptual model includes both classical and quantum security methods, providing a scalable and adaptive solution for Post-Quantum encryption data protection. This work primarily proposes a conceptual framework. Detailed implementation, security proofs, and extensive experimental validation are considered future work.

Abstract: Age assessment is crucial in forensic and judicial decision-making, particularly in cases involving undocumented individuals and unaccompanied minors, where legal thresholds determine access to protection, healthcare, and judicial procedures. Dental age assessment is widely recognized as one of the most reliable biological approaches for adolescents and young adults, but current practices are challenged by methodological heterogeneity, fragmented data representation, and limited interoperability between clinical, forensic, and legal information systems. These limitations hinder transparency and reproducibility, amplified by the increasing adoption of AI- based methods. The AIdentifyAGE ontology is domain-specific and provides a standardized, semantically coherent framework, encompassing both manual and AI-assisted forensic dental age assessment workflows, and enabling traceable linkage between observations, methods, reference data, and reported outcomes. It models the complete medico-legal workflow, integrating judicial context, individual-level information, forensic examination data, dental developmental assessment methods, radiographic imaging, statistical reference studies, and AI-based estimation methods. It is being developed together with domain experts, and it builds on upper and established biomedical, dental, and machine learning ontologies, ensuring interoperability, extensibility, and compliance with FAIR principles. The AIdentifyAGE ontology is a fundamental step to enhance consistency, transparency, and explainability, establishing a robust foundation for ontology-driven decision support systems in medico-legal and judicial contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adaptive systems often operate across multiple contexts while reusing a fixed internal state space due to constraints on memory, representation, or physical resources.

Method: Modeling contexts as interventions acting on a shared internal state, proving that any classical model reproducing contextual outcome statistics must incur an irreducible information-theoretic cost.

Result: Identify contextuality as a general representational constraint on adaptive intelligence, independent of physical implementation.

Conclusion: Contextuality is not a peculiarity of quantum mechanics, but an inevitable consequence of single-state reuse in classical probabilistic representations.

Abstract: Adaptive systems often operate across multiple contexts while reusing a fixed internal state space due to constraints on memory, representation, or physical resources. Such single-state reuse is ubiquitous in natural and artificial intelligence, yet its fundamental representational consequences remain poorly understood. We show that contextuality is not a peculiarity of quantum mechanics, but an inevitable consequence of single-state reuse in classical probabilistic representations. Modeling contexts as interventions acting on a shared internal state, we prove that any classical model reproducing contextual outcome statistics must incur an irreducible information-theoretic cost: dependence on context cannot be mediated solely through the internal state. We provide a minimal constructive example that explicitly realizes this cost and clarifies its operational meaning. We further explain how nonclassical probabilistic frameworks avoid this obstruction by relaxing the assumption of a single global joint probability space, without invoking quantum dynamics or Hilbert space structure. Our results identify contextuality as a general representational constraint on adaptive intelligence, independent of physical implementation.

Conclusion: MobCache是一个有效的移动感知缓存框架，可以显著提高大型人类流动性模拟的效率。

Abstract: Large-scale human mobility simulation is critical for applications such as urban planning, epidemiology, and transportation analysis. Recent works treat large language models (LLMs) as human agents to simulate realistic mobility behaviors using structured reasoning, but their high computational cost limits scalability. To address this, we design a mobility-aware cache framework named MobCache that leverages reconstructible caches to enable efficient large-scale human mobility simulations. It consists of: (1) a reasoning component that encodes each reasoning step as a latent-space embedding and uses a latent-space evaluator to enable the reuse and recombination of reasoning steps; and (2) a decoding component that employs a lightweight decoder trained with mobility law-constrained distillation to translate latent-space reasoning chains into natural language, thereby improving simulation efficiency while maintaining fidelity. Experiments show that MobCache significantly improves efficiency across multiple dimensions while maintaining performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based methods.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) benchmarks play a central role in measuring progress in model development and guiding deployment decisions. However, many benchmarks quickly become saturated, meaning that they can no longer differentiate between the best-performing models, diminishing their long-term value. In this study, we analyze benchmark saturation across 60 Large Language Model (LLM) benchmarks selected from technical reports by major model developers. To identify factors driving saturation, we characterize benchmarks along 14 properties spanning task design, data construction, and evaluation format. We test five hypotheses examining how each property contributes to saturation rates. Our analysis reveals that nearly half of the benchmarks exhibit saturation, with rates increasing as benchmarks age. Notably, hiding test data (i.e., public vs. private) shows no protective effect, while expert-curated benchmarks resist saturation better than crowdsourced ones. Our findings highlight which design choices extend benchmark longevity and inform strategies for more durable evaluation.

Result: 证明了S(n)的上界，并获得了使用k个超平面切片Q_n的边数的新下界

Conclusion: 该研究改进了1971年Paterson报告的S(n)的上界

Abstract: A collection of hyperplanes $\mathcal{H}$ slices all edges of the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ with vertex set $\{-1,1\}^n$ if, for every edge $e$ in the hypercube, there exists a hyperplane in $\mathcal{H}$ intersecting $e$ in its interior. Let $S(n)$ be the minimum number of hyperplanes needed to slice $Q_n$. We prove that $S(n) \leq \lceil \frac{4n}{5} \rceil$, except when $n$ is an odd multiple of $5$, in which case $S(n) \leq \frac{4n}{5} +1$. This improves upon the previously known upper bound of $S(n) \leq \lceil\frac{5n}{6} \rceil$ due to Paterson reported in 1971. We also obtain new lower bounds on the maximum number of edges in $Q_n$ that can be sliced using $k<n$ hyperplanes. We prove the improved upper bound on $S(n)$ by constructing $8$ hyperplanes slicing $Q_{10}$ aided by the recently introduced CPro1: an automatic tool that uses reasoning LLMs coupled with automated hyperparameter tuning to create search algorithms for the discovery of mathematical constructions.

Abstract: The expansion of AI toward the edge increasingly exposes the cost and fragility of cen- tralised intelligence. Data transmission, latency, energy consumption, and dependence on large data centres create bottlenecks that scale poorly across heterogeneous, mobile, and resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we introduce Node Learning, a decen- tralised learning paradigm in which intelligence resides at individual edge nodes and expands through selective peer interaction. Nodes learn continuously from local data, maintain their own model state, and exchange learned knowledge opportunistically when collaboration is beneficial. Learning propagates through overlap and diffusion rather than global synchro- nisation or central aggregation. It unifies autonomous and cooperative behaviour within a single abstraction and accommodates heterogeneity in data, hardware, objectives, and connectivity. This concept paper develops the conceptual foundations of this paradigm, contrasts it with existing decentralised approaches, and examines implications for communi- cation, hardware, trust, and governance. Node Learning does not discard existing paradigms, but places them within a broader decentralised perspective

Abstract: Traditional scoring approaches on hesitant fuzzy sets often lack a formal base in order theory. This paper proposes a unified framework, where each score is explicitly defined with respect to a given order. This order-oriented perspective enables more flexible and coherent scoring mechanisms. We examine several classical orders on hesitant fuzzy elements, that is, nonempty subsets in [0,1], and show that, contrary to prior claims, they do not induce lattice structures. In contrast, we prove that the scores defined with respect to the symmetric order satisfy key normative criteria for scoring functions, including strong monotonicity with respect to unions and the Gärdenfors condition.
  Following this analysis, we introduce a class of functions, called dominance functions, for ranking hesitant fuzzy elements. They aim to compare hesitant fuzzy elements relative to control sets incorporating minimum acceptability thresholds. Two concrete examples of dominance functions for finite sets are provided: the discrete dominance function and the relative dominance function. We show that these can be employed to construct fuzzy preference relations on typical hesitant fuzzy sets and support group decision-making.

Abstract: Agent development kits (ADKs) provide effective platforms and tooling for constructing agents, and their designs are critical to the constructed agents' performance, especially the functionality for agent topology, tools, and memory. However, current ADKs either lack sufficient functional support or rely on humans to manually design these components, limiting agents' generalizability and overall performance. We propose OpenSage, the first ADK that enables LLMs to automatically create agents with self-generated topology and toolsets while providing comprehensive and structured memory support. OpenSage offers effective functionality for agents to create and manage their own sub-agents and toolkits. It also features a hierarchical, graph-based memory system for efficient management and a specialized toolkit tailored to software engineering tasks. Extensive experiments across three state-of-the-art benchmarks with various backbone models demonstrate the advantages of OpenSage over existing ADKs. We also conduct rigorous ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our design for each component. We believe OpenSage can pave the way for the next generation of agent development, shifting the focus from human-centered to AI-centered paradigms.

Conclusion: LLM-Wikirace揭示了当前推理系统中的明显局限性，为具有规划能力的LLM提供了一个证明自己能力的开放平台。

Abstract: We introduce LLM-Wikirace, a benchmark for evaluating planning, reasoning, and world knowledge in large language models (LLMs). In LLM-Wikirace, models must efficiently navigate Wikipedia hyperlinks step by step to reach a target page from a given source, requiring look-ahead planning and the ability to reason about how concepts are connected in the real world. We evaluate a broad set of open- and closed-source models, including Gemini-3, GPT-5, and Claude Opus 4.5, which achieve the strongest results on the easy level of the task and demonstrate superhuman performance. Despite this, performance drops sharply on hard difficulty: the best-performing model, Gemini-3, succeeds in only 23\% of hard games, highlighting substantial remaining challenges for frontier models. Our analysis shows that world knowledge is a necessary ingredient for success, but only up to a point, beyond this threshold, planning and long-horizon reasoning capabilities become the dominant factors. Trajectory-level analysis further reveals that even the strongest models struggle to replan after failure, frequently entering loops rather than recovering. LLM-Wikirace is a simple benchmark that reveals clear limitations in current reasoning systems, offering an open arena where planning-capable LLMs still have much to prove.

Motivation: Lifelong multimodal agents must continuously adapt to new tasks through post-training, but this creates fundamental tension between acquiring capabilities and preserving safety alignment.

Method: Experiments on Gemma3-4B, geometric analysis

Result: Fine-tuning aligned vision-language models on narrow-domain harmful datasets induces severe emergent misalignment, misalignment scales with LoRA rank, multimodal evaluation reveals substantially higher misalignment than text-only evaluation, 10% harmful data in training mixture induces substantial alignment degradation, harmful behaviors occupy a low-dimensional subspace, two strategies evaluated to mitigate misalignment, robust continual learning frameworks needed for post-deployment settings.

Conclusion: Current post-training paradigms may not sufficiently preserve alignment in post-deployment settings.

Abstract: Lifelong multimodal agents must continuously adapt to new tasks through post-training, but this creates fundamental tension between acquiring capabilities and preserving safety alignment. We demonstrate that fine-tuning aligned vision-language models on narrow-domain harmful datasets induces severe emergent misalignment that generalizes broadly across unrelated tasks and modalities. Through experiments on Gemma3-4B, we show that misalignment scales monotonically with LoRA rank, and that multimodal evaluation reveals substantially higher misalignment ($70.71 \pm 1.22$ at $r=128$) than text-only evaluation ($41.19 \pm 2.51$), suggesting that unimodal safety benchmarks may underestimate alignment degradation in vision-language models. Critically, even 10\% harmful data in the training mixture induces substantial alignment degradation. Geometric analysis reveals that harmful behaviors occupy a remarkably low-dimensional subspace, with the majority of misalignment information captured in 10 principal components. To mitigate misalignment, we evaluate two strategies: benign narrow fine-tuning and activation-based steering. While both approaches substantially reduce misalignment, neither completely removes the learned harmful behaviors. Our findings highlight the need for robust continual learning frameworks, as current post-training paradigms may not sufficiently preserve alignment in post-deployment settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly answer queries by citing web sources, but existing evaluations emphasize answer correctness rather than evidence quality. We introduce SourceBench, a benchmark for measuring the quality of cited web sources across 100 real-world queries spanning informational, factual, argumentative, social, and shopping intents. SourceBench uses an eight-metric framework covering content quality (content relevance, factual accuracy, objectivity) and page-level signals (e.g., freshness, authority/accountability, clarity), and includes a human-labeled dataset with a calibrated LLM-based evaluator that matches expert judgments closely. We evaluate eight LLMs, Google Search, and three AI search tools over 3996 cited sources using SourceBench and conduct further experiments to understand the evaluation results. Overall, our work reveals four key new insights that can guide future research in the direction of GenAI and web search.

Motivation: Agent hijacking is a critical threat to the Large Language Model (LLM) ecosystem, allowing adversaries to manipulate execution by injecting malicious instructions into retrieved content. Existing attacks have low success rates and limited transferability.

Method: Proposing Phantom, an automated agent hijacking framework using Structured Template Injection. The framework targets the fundamental architectural mechanisms of LLM agents, relying on specific chat template tokens to separate system, user, assistant, and tool instructions. It injects optimized structured templates into the retrieved context to cause role confusion and misinterpretation of content as legitimate instructions. A novel attack template search framework is introduced to enhance attack transferability against black-box agents, using multi-level template augmentation and Template Autoencoder (TAE) for embedding templates into a searchable latent space. Bayesian optimization is used to identify optimal adversarial vectors.

Conclusion: Phantom is an effective framework for automated agent hijacking, significantly improving attack success rates and identifying real-world vulnerabilities. It provides a practical approach to securing next-generation agentic systems.

Abstract: Agent hijacking, highlighted by OWASP as a critical threat to the Large Language Model (LLM) ecosystem, enables adversaries to manipulate execution by injecting malicious instructions into retrieved content. Most existing attacks rely on manually crafted, semantics-driven prompt manipulation, which often yields low attack success rates and limited transferability to closed-source commercial models. In this paper, we propose Phantom, an automated agent hijacking framework built upon Structured Template Injection that targets the fundamental architectural mechanisms of LLM agents. Our key insight is that agents rely on specific chat template tokens to separate system, user, assistant, and tool instructions. By injecting optimized structured templates into the retrieved context, we induce role confusion and cause the agent to misinterpret the injected content as legitimate user instructions or prior tool outputs. To enhance attack transferability against black-box agents, Phantom introduces a novel attack template search framework. We first perform multi-level template augmentation to increase structural diversity and then train a Template Autoencoder (TAE) to embed discrete templates into a continuous, searchable latent space. Subsequently, we apply Bayesian optimization to efficiently identify optimal adversarial vectors that are decoded into high-potency structured templates. Extensive experiments on Qwen, GPT, and Gemini demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing baselines in both Attack Success Rate (ASR) and query efficiency. Moreover, we identified over 70 vulnerabilities in real-world commercial products that have been confirmed by vendors, underscoring the practical severity of structured template-based hijacking and providing an empirical foundation for securing next-generation agentic systems.

Conclusion: HQFS通过结合量子计算和经典计算，提高了金融风险系统的预测精度和决策稳定性，同时满足了监管要求。

Abstract: Here's the corrected paragraph with all punctuation and formatting issues fixed:
  Financial risk systems usually follow a two-step routine: a model predicts return or risk, and then an optimizer makes a decision such as a portfolio rebalance. In practice, this split can break under real constraints. The prediction model may look good, but the final decision can be unstable when the market shifts, when discrete constraints are added (lot sizes, caps), or when the optimization becomes slow for larger asset sets. Also, regulated settings need a clear audit trail that links each decision to the exact model state and inputs. We present HQFS, a practical hybrid pipeline that connects forecasting, discrete risk optimization, and auditability in one flow. First, HQFS learns next-step return and a volatility proxy using a variational quantum circuit (VQC) with a small classical head. Second, HQFS converts the risk-return objective and constraints into a QUBO and solves it with quantum annealing when available, while keeping a compatible classical QUBO solver as a fallback for deployment. Third, HQFS signs each rebalance output using a post-quantum signature so the allocation can be verified later without trusting the runtime environment. On our market dataset study, HQFS reduces return prediction error by 7.8% and volatility prediction error by 6.1% versus a tuned classical baseline. For the decision layer, HQFS improves out-of-sample Sharpe by 9.4% and lowers maximum drawdown by 11.7%. The QUBO solve stage also cuts average solve time by 28% compared to a mixed-integer baseline under the same constraints, while producing fully traceable, signed allocation records.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Black-box safety evaluation of AI systems assumes model behavior on test distributions reliably predicts deployment performance.

Method: Formalize and challenge this assumption through latent context-conditioned policies.

Result: Establish fundamental limits showing that no black-box evaluator can reliably estimate deployment risk for such models. Provide lower bounds for passive and adaptive evaluation, and a computational separation result under trapdoor one-way function assumptions.

Conclusion: Black-box testing is statistically underdetermined and additional safeguards are mathematically necessary for worst-case safety assurance.

Abstract: Black-box safety evaluation of AI systems assumes model behavior on test distributions reliably predicts deployment performance. We formalize and challenge this assumption through latent context-conditioned policies -- models whose outputs depend on unobserved internal variables that are rare under evaluation but prevalent under deployment. We establish fundamental limits showing that no black-box evaluator can reliably estimate deployment risk for such models. (1) Passive evaluation: For evaluators sampling i.i.d. from D_eval, we prove minimax lower bounds via Le Cam's method: any estimator incurs expected absolute error >= (5/24)*delta*L approximately 0.208*delta*L, where delta is trigger probability under deployment and L is the loss gap. (2) Adaptive evaluation: Using a hash-based trigger construction and Yao's minimax principle, worst-case error remains >= delta*L/16 even for fully adaptive querying when D_dep is supported over a sufficiently large domain; detection requires Theta(1/epsilon) queries. (3) Computational separation: Under trapdoor one-way function assumptions, deployment environments possessing privileged information can activate unsafe behaviors that any polynomial-time evaluator without the trapdoor cannot distinguish. For white-box probing, estimating deployment risk to accuracy epsilon_R requires O(1/(gamma^2 * epsilon_R^2)) samples, where gamma = alpha_0 + alpha_1 - 1 measures probe quality, and we provide explicit bias correction under probe error. Our results quantify when black-box testing is statistically underdetermined and provide explicit criteria for when additional safeguards -- architectural constraints, training-time guarantees, interpretability, and deployment monitoring -- are mathematically necessary for worst-case safety assurance.

TL;DR: Conv-FinRe基准评估LLMs在股票推荐方面的表现，超越了行为匹配，揭示了基于效用的排名和行为一致之间的紧张关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在金融咨询中，观察到的行为可能受到市场波动的影响，可能短视，并且可能与用户的长期目标相冲突。因此，将用户的选择作为唯一的事实，将行为模仿与决策质量混淆。

Method: Conv-FinRe，一种对话和纵向基准，用于评估LLMs在股票推荐方面的表现，超越了行为匹配。

Result: 结果显示，在基于效用的排名和与行为一致之间存在着持续的紧张关系：在基于效用的排名上表现良好的模型往往无法匹配用户的选择，而行为一致模型可能过度拟合短期噪声。

Conclusion: Conv-FinRe为LLMs在股票推荐方面的评估提供了一种新的方法，有助于诊断LLMs是否遵循理性分析、模仿用户噪声或受市场动量驱动。

Abstract: Most recommendation benchmarks evaluate how well a model imitates user behavior. In financial advisory, however, observed actions can be noisy or short-sighted under market volatility and may conflict with a user's long-term goals. Treating what users chose as the sole ground truth, therefore, conflates behavioral imitation with decision quality. We introduce Conv-FinRe, a conversational and longitudinal benchmark for stock recommendation that evaluates LLMs beyond behavior matching. Given an onboarding interview, step-wise market context, and advisory dialogues, models must generate rankings over a fixed investment horizon. Crucially, Conv-FinRe provides multi-view references that distinguish descriptive behavior from normative utility grounded in investor-specific risk preferences, enabling diagnosis of whether an LLM follows rational analysis, mimics user noise, or is driven by market momentum. We build the benchmark from real market data and human decision trajectories, instantiate controlled advisory conversations, and evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs. Results reveal a persistent tension between rational decision quality and behavioral alignment: models that perform well on utility-based ranking often fail to match user choices, whereas behaviorally aligned models can overfit short-term noise. The dataset is publicly released on Hugging Face, and the codebase is available on GitHub.

TL;DR: Sonar-TS解决NLQ4TSDB问题，有效导航复杂时间查询，促进未来研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非专家用户从大量时间记录中检索有意义的事件、时间间隔和摘要，现有文本到SQL方法不适合连续形态意图，时间序列模型难以处理超长历史记录。

Method: 提出Sonar-TS，一个神经符号框架，通过搜索-验证管道解决NLQ4TSDB问题，使用特征索引通过SQL ping候选窗口，然后使用生成的Python程序锁定并验证候选者。

Result: 引入NLQTSBench，第一个为NLQ在TSDB规模历史记录中设计的基准测试。实验表明Sonar-TS有效导航复杂的时间查询，传统方法失败。

Conclusion: 对NLQ4TSDB进行首次系统研究，提供通用框架和评估标准，促进未来研究。

Abstract: Natural Language Querying for Time Series Databases (NLQ4TSDB) aims to assist non-expert users retrieve meaningful events, intervals, and summaries from massive temporal records. However, existing Text-to-SQL methods are not designed for continuous morphological intents such as shapes or anomalies, while time series models struggle to handle ultra-long histories. To address these challenges, we propose Sonar-TS, a neuro-symbolic framework that tackles NLQ4TSDB via a Search-Then-Verify pipeline. Analogous to active sonar, it utilizes a feature index to ping candidate windows via SQL, followed by generated Python programs to lock on and verify candidates against raw signals. To enable effective evaluation, we introduce NLQTSBench, the first large-scale benchmark designed for NLQ over TSDB-scale histories. Our experiments highlight the unique challenges within this domain and demonstrate that Sonar-TS effectively navigates complex temporal queries where traditional methods fail. This work presents the first systematic study of NLQ4TSDB, offering a general framework and evaluation standard to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代多人在线游戏中，公平且快速的匹配系统是重要组成部分，直接影响玩家留存和满意度。然而，在异质技能水平的快速匹配中，确保公平性是一个重大挑战。

Method: 提出了一种名为Cinder的两阶段匹配系统，首先通过Ruzicka相似性指数比较“非异常值”技能范围，然后使用非线性的技能桶来提供更高的平均技能水平粒度，最后使用Kantorovich距离来量化潜在匹配的公平性。

Result: 通过分析1.4亿个模拟的快速匹配对，证明了该系统的可行性，为公平匹配阈值提供了坚实的基础。

Conclusion: Cinder系统可以提供快速且公平的匹配，有助于提高玩家留存和满意度。

Abstract: A fair and fast matchmaking system is an important component of modern multiplayer online games, directly impacting player retention and satisfaction. However, creating fair matches between lobbies (pre-made teams) of heterogeneous skill levels presents a significant challenge. Matching based simply on average team skill metrics, such as mean or median rating or rank, often results in unbalanced and one-sided games, particularly when skill distributions are wide or skewed. This paper introduces Cinder, a two-stage matchmaking system designed to provide fast and fair matches. Cinder first employs a rapid preliminary filter by comparing the "non-outlier" skill range of lobbies using the Ruzicka similarity index. Lobbies that pass this initial check are then evaluated using a more precise fairness metric. This second stage involves mapping player ranks to a non-linear set of skill buckets, generated from an inverted normal distribution, to provide higher granularity at average skill levels. The fairness of a potential match is then quantified using the Kantorovich distance on the lobbies' sorted bucket indices, producing a "Sanction Score." We demonstrate the system's viability by analyzing the distribution of Sanction Scores from 140 million simulated lobby pairings, providing a robust foundation for fair matchmaking thresholds.

TL;DR: M2F框架实现了大规模数学文献的自动化形式化，具有实际应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化数学公式的形式化可以促进机械验证，但目前仅限于孤立的定理和简短的片段。将规模扩展到教科书和研究论文仍然是一个未解决的问题，因为它需要管理跨文件依赖关系、解决导入问题并确保整个项目能够从头到尾编译。

Method: M2F（Math-to-Formal）框架，分为两个阶段：声明编译阶段和证明修复阶段。

Result: M2F将长篇数学文献转换为项目规模的Lean库，并实现了96%的证明成功率。

Conclusion: M2F框架实现了大规模数学文献的自动化形式化，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Automated formalization of mathematics enables mechanical verification but remains limited to isolated theorems and short snippets. Scaling to textbooks and research papers is largely unaddressed, as it requires managing cross-file dependencies, resolving imports, and ensuring that entire projects compile end-to-end. We present M2F (Math-to-Formal), the first agentic framework for end-to-end, project-scale autoformalization in Lean. The framework operates in two stages. The statement compilation stage splits the document into atomic blocks, orders them via inferred dependencies, and repairs declaration skeletons until the project compiles, allowing placeholders in proofs. The proof repair stage closes these holes under fixed signatures using goal-conditioned local edits. Throughout both stages, M2F keeps the verifier in the loop, committing edits only when toolchain feedback confirms improvement. In approximately three weeks, M2F converts long-form mathematical sources into a project-scale Lean library of 153,853 lines from 479 pages textbooks on real analysis and convex analysis, fully formalized as Lean declarations with accompanying proofs. This represents textbook-scale formalization at a pace that would typically require months or years of expert effort. On FATE-H, we achieve $96\%$ proof success (vs.\ $80\%$ for a strong baseline). Together, these results demonstrate that practical, large-scale automated formalization of mathematical literature is within reach. The full generated Lean code from our runs is available at https://github.com/optsuite/ReasBook.git.

Conclusion: Sales Research Agent在质量上优于Claude Sonnet 4.5和ChatGPT-5，为AI解决方案的比较提供了一个可重复的方法。

Abstract: Enterprises increasingly need AI systems that can answer sales-leader questions over live, customized CRM data, but most available models do not expose transparent, repeatable evidence of quality. This paper describes the Sales Research Agent in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales, an AI-first application that connects to live CRM and related data, reasons over complex schemas, and produces decision-ready insights through text and chart outputs. To make quality observable, we introduce the Sales Research Bench, a purpose-built benchmark that scores systems on eight customer-weighted dimensions, including text and chart groundedness, relevance, explainability, schema accuracy, and chart quality.

TL;DR: 提出PA-MoE，解决RL中简单任务主导问题，提高复杂任务处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有强化学习（RL）方法中简单任务占用大部分参数并主导梯度更新的问题，提出了混合专家（MoE）架构。然而，传统MoE的token级路由限制了专家的专长。

Method: 提出了一种称为PA-MoE的新架构，它包括一个轻量级的阶段路由器，该路由器直接从RL目标中学习潜在的相位边界，并分配时间上一致的分配给相同的专家，以保持专家的专长。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的PA-MoE是有效的。

Conclusion: PA-MoE可以有效地解决简单任务在RL中的主导地位问题，提高复杂任务的处理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has equipped LLM agents with a strong ability to solve complex tasks. However, existing RL methods normally use a \emph{single} policy network, causing \emph{simplicity bias} where simple tasks occupy most parameters and dominate gradient updates, leaving insufficient capacity for complex tasks. A plausible remedy could be employing the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in the policy network, as MoE allows different parameters (experts) to specialize in different tasks, preventing simple tasks from dominating all parameters. However, a key limitation of traditional MoE is its token-level routing, where the router assigns each token to specialized experts, which fragments phase-consistent patterns into scattered expert assignments and thus undermines expert specialization. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Phase-Aware Mixture of Experts (PA-MoE)}. It first features a lightweight \emph{phase router} that learns latent phase boundaries directly from the RL objective without pre-defining phase categories. Then, the phase router allocates temporally consistent assignments to the same expert, allowing experts to preserve phase-specific expertise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PA-MoE.

Motivation: 现有方法，从基于强化学习的规划器到轨迹检索，往往偏离用户意图，反复解决常规子问题，导致错误累积和效率低下。

Method: 我们提出了IntentCUA，一个多智能体计算机使用框架，通过意图对齐的计划内存来稳定长期执行。

Result: IntentCUA在端到端评估中实现了74.83%的任务成功率，Step Efficiency Ratio为0.91，优于基于强化学习和以轨迹为中心的基线。

Conclusion: 系统级意图抽象和基于内存的协调对于在大规模动态环境中实现可靠且高效的桌面自动化至关重要。

Abstract: Computer-use agents operate over long horizons under noisy perception, multi-window contexts, evolving environment states. Existing approaches, from RL-based planners to trajectory retrieval, often drift from user intent and repeatedly solve routine subproblems, leading to error accumulation and inefficiency. We present IntentCUA, a multi-agent computer-use framework designed to stabilize long-horizon execution through intent-aligned plan memory. A Planner, Plan-Optimizer, and Critic coordinate over shared memory that abstracts raw interaction traces into multi-view intent representations and reusable skills. At runtime, intent prototypes retrieve subgroup-aligned skills and inject them into partial plans, reducing redundant re-planning and mitigating error propagation across desktop applications. In end-to-end evaluations, IntentCUA achieved a 74.83% task success rate with a Step Efficiency Ratio of 0.91, outperforming RL-based and trajectory-centric baselines. Ablations show that multi-view intent abstraction and shared plan memory jointly improve execution stability, with the cooperative multi-agent loop providing the largest gains on long-horizon tasks. These results highlight that system-level intent abstraction and memory-grounded coordination are key to reliable and efficient desktop automation in large, dynamic environments.

*Yunseok Han,Yejoon Lee,Jaeyoung Do*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型推理模型在推理忠实度方面存在问题，准确性不能可靠地代表忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）虽然表现强大，但往往产生看似合理但无法反映其真实决策过程的理由，这会损害可靠性和信任。

Method: 提出一个推理忠实度的形式框架，定义了两个可测试条件：立场一致性（将推理与答案联系起来的连贯立场）和因果影响（在输出级别干预下，所陈述的推理因果导致答案）。为了实现这一点，提出了RFEval，这是一个包含7,186个实例的基准，通过控制、输出级别的反事实干预来探究忠实度。

Result: 评估了12个开源LRMs，发现49.7%的输出存在不忠实度，主要是立场不一致。失败主要集中在脆弱、收敛的领域，如数学和代码，并且与后训练制度比与规模相关。在家族消融中，添加当前的RL风格目标可以降低推理忠实度，即使准确性保持不变。关键的是，准确性既不是忠实度的充分条件，也不是可靠条件：一旦控制模型和任务，准确性与忠实度之间的联系就变得微弱且统计上不显著。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了一种严格的审计LRM可靠性的方法，表明可信赖的AI不仅需要优化正确的结果，还需要优化推理过程的结构完整性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit strong performance, yet often produce rationales that sound plausible but fail to reflect their true decision process, undermining reliability and trust. We introduce a formal framework for reasoning faithfulness, defined by two testable conditions: stance consistency (a coherent stance linking reasoning to answer) and causal influence (the stated reasoning causally drives the answer under output-level interventions), explicitly decoupled from accuracy. To operationalize this, we present RFEval, a benchmark of 7,186 instances across seven tasks that probes faithfulness via controlled, output-level counterfactual interventions. Evaluating twelve open-source LRMs, we find unfaithfulness in 49.7% of outputs, predominantly from stance inconsistency. Failures are concentrated in brittle, convergent domains such as math and code, and correlate more with post-training regimes than with scale: within-family ablations indicate that adding current RL-style objectives on top of supervised fine-tuning can reduce reasoning faithfulness, even when accuracy is maintained. Crucially, accuracy is neither a sufficient nor a reliable proxy for faithfulness: once controlling for model and task, the accuracy-faithfulness link is weak and statistically insignificant. Our work establishes a rigorous methodology for auditing LRM reliability and shows that trustworthy AI requires optimizing not only for correct outcomes but also for the structural integrity of the reasoning process. Our code and dataset can be found at project page: $\href{https://aidaslab.github.io/RFEval/}{https://aidaslab.github.io/RFEval/}$

Motivation: 解决现有方法在训练过程中对价值函数变化的适应性不足的问题

Method: 提出Successive Sub-value Q-learning (S2Q)算法，学习多个子价值函数，并将其融入Softmax行为策略中

Result: 实验结果表明，S2Q在多个MARL基准测试中优于其他算法，提高了适应性和整体性能

Conclusion: S2Q算法通过学习多个子价值函数，提高了合作多智能体强化学习在训练过程中的适应性和性能

Abstract: Value decomposition is a core approach for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing methods still rely on a single optimal action and struggle to adapt when the underlying value function shifts during training, often converging to suboptimal policies. To address this limitation, we propose Successive Sub-value Q-learning (S2Q), which learns multiple sub-value functions to retain alternative high-value actions. Incorporating these sub-value functions into a Softmax-based behavior policy, S2Q encourages persistent exploration and enables $Q^{\text{tot}}$ to adjust quickly to the changing optima. Experiments on challenging MARL benchmarks confirm that S2Q consistently outperforms various MARL algorithms, demonstrating improved adaptability and overall performance.

Motivation: 加速语言模型收敛

Method: 动态优先处理高损失样本

Result: 比基线快6-13%，预测器相关性从0.14提升到0.44

Conclusion: 有效利用样本难度信息，实现高效课程学习，计算开销小

Abstract: We introduce Predictive Batch Scheduling (PBS), a novel training optimization technique that accelerates language model convergence by dynamically prioritizing high-loss samples during batch construction. Unlike curriculum learning approaches that require predefined difficulty metrics or hard example mining methods that demand expensive per-sample loss tracking, PBS employs a lightweight linear predictor trained online to estimate sample difficulty from static token-level features. Our predictor achieves 0.44 correlation with actual loss using only four simple features: token frequency, sequence length, vocabulary diversity, and rare token ratio. Experiments on a 130M parameter transformer demonstrate that PBS achieves 6-13\% faster convergence measured by evaluation loss across training checkpoints, with the predictor's correlation improving from 0.14 to 0.44 over 10,000 training steps. These results validate that token frequency statistics encode meaningful information about sample difficulty, enabling effective curriculum learning with negligible computational overhead.

Result: 该框架可实现可持续性评级方法的可扩展和可比评估。

Conclusion: 呼吁更广泛的人工智能社区采用人工智能方法来加强和推进支持并执行紧迫的可持续发展议程的可持续性评级方法。

Abstract: Sustainability or ESG rating agencies use company disclosures and external data to produce scores or ratings that assess the environmental, social, and governance performance of a company. However, sustainability ratings across agencies for a single company vary widely, limiting their comparability, credibility, and relevance to decision-making. To harmonize the rating results, we propose adopting a universal human-AI collaboration framework to generate trustworthy benchmark datasets for evaluating sustainability rating methodologies. The framework comprises two complementary parts: STRIDE (Sustainability Trust Rating & Integrity Data Equation) provides principled criteria and a scoring system that guide the construction of firm-level benchmark datasets using large language models (LLMs), and SR-Delta, a discrepancy-analysis procedural framework that surfaces insights for potential adjustments. The framework enables scalable and comparable assessment of sustainability rating methodologies. We call on the broader AI community to adopt AI-powered approaches to strengthen and advance sustainability rating methodologies that support and enforce urgent sustainability agendas.

Motivation: 解决Shapley值方法在视觉任务中特征独立性假设的局限性。

Method: 提出了一种新的层次化分组方法，用于特征归因，并进行了实验验证。

Result: O-Shap在图像和表格数据集上的实验表明，其在归因精度、语义一致性和运行效率方面优于基线SHAP变种。

Conclusion: O-Shap在解释性人工智能中优于基线SHAP变种，特别是在结构重要的任务中。

Abstract: Shapley value-based methods have become foundational in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), offering theoretically grounded feature attributions through cooperative game theory. However, in practice, particularly in vision tasks, the assumption of feature independence breaks down, as features (i.e., pixels) often exhibit strong spatial and semantic dependencies. To address this, modern SHAP implementations now include the Owen value, a hierarchical generalization of the Shapley value that supports group attributions. While the Owen value preserves the foundations of Shapley values, its effectiveness critically depends on how feature groups are defined. We show that commonly used segmentations (e.g., axis-aligned or SLIC) violate key consistency properties, and propose a new segmentation approach that satisfies the $T$-property to ensure semantic alignment across hierarchy levels. This hierarchy enables computational pruning while improving attribution accuracy and interpretability. Experiments on image and tabular datasets demonstrate that O-Shap outperforms baseline SHAP variants in attribution precision, semantic coherence, and runtime efficiency, especially when structure matters.

Method: 提出InstructKG框架，自动构建与教师对齐的知识图，捕获课程的学习进展。

Result: 实验表明，InstructKG能够捕获丰富的、与教师对齐的学习进展。

Conclusion: InstructKG在识别学生的知识差距和个性化学习方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Mastering educational concepts requires understanding both their prerequisites (e.g., recursion before merge sort) and sub-concepts (e.g., merge sort as part of sorting algorithms). Capturing these dependencies is critical for identifying students' knowledge gaps and enabling targeted intervention for personalized learning. This is especially challenging in large-scale courses, where instructors cannot feasibly diagnose individual misunderstanding or determine which concepts need reinforcement. While knowledge graphs offer a natural representation for capturing these conceptual relationships at scale, existing approaches are either surface-level (focusing on course-level concepts like "Algorithms" or logistical relationships such as course enrollment), or disregard the rich pedagogical signals embedded in instructional materials. We propose InstructKG, a framework for automatically constructing instructor-aligned knowledge graphs that capture a course's intended learning progression. Given a course's lecture materials (slides, notes, etc.), InstructKG extracts significant concepts as nodes and infers learning dependencies as directed edges (e.g., "part-of" or "depends-on" relationships). The framework synergizes the rich temporal and semantic signals unique to educational materials (e.g., "recursion" is taught before "mergesort"; "recursion" is mentioned in the definition of "merge sort") with the generalizability of large language models. Through experiments on real-world, diverse lecture materials across multiple courses and human-based evaluation, we demonstrate that InstructKG captures rich, instructor-aligned learning progressions.

Motivation: Generative AI presents an unprecedented challenge to our understanding of knowledge and its production.

Method: Develops an Indexical Epistemology of High-Dimensional Spaces, drawing on Peirce semiotics and Papert constructionism.

Result: Reconceptualizes generative models as navigators of learned manifolds and proposes navigational knowledge as a third mode of knowledge production.

Conclusion: Generative AI requires a paradigmatic break in our understanding of knowledge and its production.

Abstract: Generative AI presents an unprecedented challenge to our understanding of knowledge and its production. Unlike previous technological transformations, where engineering understanding preceded or accompanied deployment, generative AI operates through mechanisms whose epistemic character remains obscure, and without such understanding, its responsible integration into science, education, and institutional life cannot proceed on a principled basis. This paper argues that the missing account must begin with a paradigmatic break that has not yet received adequate philosophical attention. In the Turing-Shannon-von Neumann tradition, information enters the machine as encoded binary vectors, and semantics remains external to the process. Neural network architectures rupture this regime: symbolic input is instantly projected into a high-dimensional space where coordinates correspond to semantic parameters, transforming binary code into a position in a geometric space of meanings. It is this space that constitutes the active epistemic condition shaping generative production. Drawing on four structural properties of high-dimensional geometry concentration of measure, near-orthogonality, exponential directional capacity, and manifold regularity the paper develops an Indexical Epistemology of High-Dimensional Spaces. Building on Peirce semiotics and Papert constructionism, it reconceptualizes generative models as navigators of learned manifolds and proposes navigational knowledge as a third mode of knowledge production, distinct from both symbolic reasoning and statistical recombination.

Conclusion: JEPA-DNA提供了一种更稳健且基于生物学的表示，为理解基因组序列的底层功能逻辑提供了可扩展的途径。

Abstract: Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs) have largely relied on Masked Language Modeling (MLM) or Next Token Prediction (NTP) to learn the language of life. While these paradigms excel at capturing local genomic syntax and fine-grained motif patterns, they often fail to capture the broader functional context, resulting in representations that lack a global biological perspective. We introduce JEPA-DNA, a novel pre-training framework that integrates the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) with traditional generative objectives. JEPA-DNA introduces latent grounding by coupling token-level recovery with a predictive objective in the latent space by supervising a CLS token. This forces the model to predict the high-level functional embeddings of masked genomic segments rather than focusing solely on individual nucleotides. JEPA-DNA extends both NTP and MLM paradigms and can be deployed either as a standalone from-scratch objective or as a continual pre-training enhancement for existing GFMs. Our evaluations across a diverse suite of genomic benchmarks demonstrate that JEPA-DNA consistently yields superior performance in supervised and zero-shot tasks compared to generative-only baselines. By providing a more robust and biologically grounded representation, JEPA-DNA offers a scalable path toward foundation models that understand not only the genomic alphabet, but also the underlying functional logic of the sequence.

Abstract: Efficiently navigating complex environments requires agents to internalize the underlying logic of their world, yet standard world modelling methods often struggle with sample inefficiency, lack of transparency, and poor scalability. We propose a framework for constructing symbolic causal world models entirely online by integrating continuous model learning and repair into the agent's decision loop, by leveraging the power of Meta-Interpretive Learning and predicate invention to find semantically meaningful and reusable abstractions, allowing an agent to construct a hierarchy of disentangled, high-quality concepts from its observations. We demonstrate that our lifted inference approach scales to domains with complex relational dynamics, where propositional methods suffer from combinatorial explosion, while achieving sample-efficiency orders of magnitude higher than the established PPO neural-network-based baseline.

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping knowledge work, yet existing research focuses predominantly on software engineering and the natural sciences, with limited methodological exploration for the humanities and social sciences. Positioned as a "methodological experiment," this study proposes an AI Agent-based collaborative research workflow (Agentic Workflow) for humanities and social science research. Taiwan's Claude.ai usage data (N = 7,729 conversations, November 2025) from the Anthropic Economic Index (AEI) serves as the empirical vehicle for validating the feasibility of this methodology.
  This study operates on two levels: the primary level is the design and validation of a methodological framework - a seven-stage modular workflow grounded in three principles: task modularization, human-AI division of labor, and verifiability, with each stage delineating clear roles for human researchers (research judgment and ethical decisions) and AI Agents (information retrieval and text generation); the secondary level is the empirical analysis of AEI Taiwan data - serving as an operational demonstration of the workflow's application to secondary data research, showcasing both the process and output quality (see Appendix A).
  This study contributes by proposing a replicable AI collaboration framework for humanities and social science researchers, and identifying three operational modes of human-AI collaboration - direct execution, iterative refinement, and human-led - through reflexive documentation of the operational process. This taxonomy reveals the irreplaceability of human judgment in research question formulation, theoretical interpretation, contextualized reasoning, and ethical reflection. Limitations including single-platform data, cross-sectional design, and AI reliability risks are acknowledged.

Abstract: Predicting human decision-making in high-stakes environments remains a central challenge for artificial intelligence. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning, they often struggle to generate consistent, individual-specific behavior, particularly when accurate prediction depends on complex interactions between psychological traits and situational constraints. Prompting-based approaches can be brittle in this setting, exhibiting identity drift and limited ability to leverage increasingly detailed persona descriptions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Large Behavioral Model (LBM), a behavioral foundation model fine-tuned to predict individual strategic choices with high fidelity. LBM shifts from transient persona prompting to behavioral embedding by conditioning on a structured, high-dimensional trait profile derived from a comprehensive psychometric battery. Trained on a proprietary dataset linking stable dispositions, motivational states, and situational constraints to observed choices, LBM learns to map rich psychological profiles to discrete actions across diverse strategic dilemmas. In a held-out scenario evaluation, LBM fine-tuning improves behavioral prediction relative to the unadapted Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone and performs comparably to frontier baselines when conditioned on Big Five traits. Moreover, we find that while prompting-based baselines exhibit a complexity ceiling, LBM continues to benefit from increasingly dense trait profiles, with performance improving as additional trait dimensions are provided. Together, these results establish LBM as a scalable approach for high-fidelity behavioral simulation, enabling applications in strategic foresight, negotiation analysis, cognitive security, and decision support.

Abstract: The black-box nature of Large Language Models necessitates novel evaluation frameworks that transcend surface-level performance metrics. This study investigates the internal neural representations of cognitive complexity using Bloom's Taxonomy as a hierarchical lens. By analyzing high-dimensional activation vectors from different LLMs, we probe whether different cognitive levels, ranging from basic recall (Remember) to abstract synthesis (Create), are linearly separable within the model's residual streams. Our results demonstrate that linear classifiers achieve approximately 95% mean accuracy across all Bloom levels, providing strong evidence that cognitive level is encoded in a linearly accessible subspace of the model's representations. These findings provide evidence that the model resolves the cognitive difficulty of a prompt early in the forward pass, with representations becoming increasingly separable across layers.

Result: 实验表明TimeSPEC模型能够显著减少时间知识泄露，同时保持任务性能

Conclusion: TimeSPEC模型能够有效减少时间知识泄露，提高LLM在预测未来事件时的准确性

Abstract: To evaluate whether LLMs can accurately predict future events, we need the ability to \textit{backtest} them on events that have already resolved. This requires models to reason only with information available at a specified past date. Yet LLMs may inadvertently leak post-cutoff knowledge encoded during training, undermining the validity of retrospective evaluation. We introduce a claim-level framework for detecting and quantifying this \emph{temporal knowledge leakage}. Our approach decomposes model rationales into atomic claims and categorizes them by temporal verifiability, then applies \textit{Shapley values} to measure each claim's contribution to the prediction. This yields the \textbf{Shapley}-weighted \textbf{D}ecision-\textbf{C}ritical \textbf{L}eakage \textbf{R}ate (\textbf{Shapley-DCLR}), an interpretable metric that captures what fraction of decision-driving reasoning derives from leaked information. Building on this framework, we propose \textbf{Time}-\textbf{S}upervised \textbf{P}rediction with \textbf{E}xtracted \textbf{C}laims (\textbf{TimeSPEC}), which interleaves generation with claim verification and regeneration to proactively filter temporal contamination -- producing predictions where every supporting claim can be traced to sources available before the cutoff date. Experiments on 350 instances spanning U.S. Supreme Court case prediction, NBA salary estimation, and stock return ranking reveal substantial leakage in standard prompting baselines. TimeSPEC reduces Shapley-DCLR while preserving task performance, demonstrating that explicit, interpretable claim-level verification outperforms prompt-based temporal constraints for reliable backtesting.

Abstract: While frontier large language models demonstrate strong reasoning and mathematical capabilities, the practical process of training domain-specialized scientific language models from raw sources remains under-documented. In this work, we present a detailed case study of training a 1.36B-parameter scientific language model directly from raw arXiv LaTeX sources spanning mathematics, computer science, and theoretical physics. We describe an end-to-end pipeline covering metadata filtering, archive validation, LaTeX extraction, text normalization, domain-aware tokenization, and dense transformer training under constrained compute (2xA100 GPUs). Through 24 experimental runs, we analyze training stability, scaling behavior, data yield losses, and infrastructure bottlenecks. Our findings highlight how preprocessing decisions significantly affect usable token volume, how tokenization impacts symbolic stability, and how storage and I/O constraints can rival compute as limiting factors. We further analyze convergence dynamics and show stable training behavior in a data-rich regime (52B pretraining tokens). Rather than proposing a novel architecture, this work provides an engineering-grounded, transparent account of training a small scientific language model from scratch. We hope these insights support researchers operating under moderate compute budgets who seek to build domain-specialized models.

Abstract: Task Arithmetic yields a modular, scalable way to adapt foundation models. Combining multiple task vectors, however, can lead to cross-task interference, causing representation drift and degraded performance. Representation drift regularization provides a natural remedy to disentangle task vectors; however, existing approaches typically require external task data, conflicting with modularity and data availability constraints (e.g., privacy requirements). We propose a dataless approach by framing regularization against representation drift as a curvature matrix approximation problem. This allows us to leverage well-established techniques; in particular, we adopt Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature and obtain a practical regularizer that achieves state-of-the-art results in task addition and negation. Our method has constant complexity in the number of tasks and promotes robustness to task vector rescaling, eliminating the need for held-out tuning.

Abstract: Information retrieval lies at the foundation of the modern digital industry. While natural language search has seen dramatic progress in recent years largely driven by embedding-based models and large-scale pretraining, the field still faces significant challenges. Specifically, queries that involve complex relationships, object compositions, or precise constraints such as identities, counts and proportions often remain unresolved or unreliable within current frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates formal verification into deep learning-based image retrieval through a synergistic combination of graph-based verification methods and neural code generation. Our approach aims to support open-vocabulary natural language queries while producing results that are both trustworthy and verifiable. By grounding retrieval results in a system of formal reasoning, we move beyond the ambiguity and approximation that often characterize vector representations. Instead of accepting uncertainty as a given, our framework explicitly verifies each atomic truth in the user query against the retrieved content. This allows us to not only return matching results, but also to identify and mark which specific constraints are satisfied and which remain unmet, thereby offering a more transparent and accountable retrieval process while boosting the results of the most popular embedding-based approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测非小细胞肺癌患者的生存结果具有挑战性，因为个体预后特征不同。这项任务可以从整合全切片图像、 bulk转录组和DNA甲基化中受益，这些方法在诊断时提供了对病人状况的互补视角。然而，现实世界的临床数据集通常不完整，很大一部分患者的整个模态缺失。最先进的模型依赖于可用数据来创建患者级别的表示或使用生成模型来推断缺失的模态，但在严重缺失的情况下缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了一种多模态对比变分自动编码器（MCVAE）来解决这个问题：模态特定的变分编码器捕获每个数据源中的不确定性，并引入了一个具有学习门控机制的融合瓶颈，以规范现有模态的贡献。提出了一个多任务目标，结合生存损失和重建损失来规范化患者表示，以及一个跨模态对比损失，强制在潜在空间中实现跨模态对齐。在训练过程中，我们应用随机模态掩码来提高对任意缺失模式鲁棒性。

Result: 在TCGA-LUAD（n=475）和TCGA-LUSC（n=446）数据集上进行了广泛的评估，证明了我们方法在预测疾病特异性生存（DSS）方面的有效性及其与两种最先进模型相比在严重缺失情况下的鲁棒性。最后，通过测试我们的模型在所有模态子集上的性能，对多模态集成进行了一些澄清，发现集成并不总是有益于任务。

Conclusion: 提出了一种多模态对比变分自动编码器（MCVAE），有效地解决了非小细胞肺癌患者生存结果预测的挑战，并提高了对严重缺失情况的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Predicting survival outcomes for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is challenging due to the different individual prognostic features. This task can benefit from the integration of whole-slide images, bulk transcriptomics, and DNA methylation, which offer complementary views of the patient's condition at diagnosis. However, real-world clinical datasets are often incomplete, with entire modalities missing for a significant fraction of patients. State-of-the-art models rely on available data to create patient-level representations or use generative models to infer missing modalities, but they lack robustness in cases of severe missingness. We propose a Multimodal Contrastive Variational AutoEncoder (MCVAE) to address this issue: modality-specific variational encoders capture the uncertainty in each data source, and a fusion bottleneck with learned gating mechanisms is introduced to normalize the contributions from present modalities. We propose a multi-task objective that combines survival loss and reconstruction loss to regularize patient representations, along with a cross-modal contrastive loss that enforces cross-modal alignment in the latent space. During training, we apply stochastic modality masking to improve the robustness to arbitrary missingness patterns. Extensive evaluations on the TCGA-LUAD (n=475) and TCGA-LUSC (n=446) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in predicting disease-specific survival (DSS) and its robustness to severe missingness scenarios compared to two state-of-the-art models. Finally, we bring some clarifications on multimodal integration by testing our model on all subsets of modalities, finding that integration is not always beneficial to the task.

Conclusion: 该框架有助于设计者和开发者采取主动和风险规避的方法，在技术设计中确保儿童隐私保护

Abstract: Children are increasingly using technologies powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, there are growing concerns about privacy risks, particularly for children. Although existing privacy regulations require companies and organizations to implement protections, doing so can be challenging in practice. To address this challenge, this article proposes a framework based on Privacy-by-Design (PbD), which guides designers and developers to take on a proactive and risk-averse approach to technology design. Our framework includes principles from several privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from the European Union, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) from Canada, and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) from the United States. We map these principles to various stages of applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs), including data collection, model training, operational monitoring, and ongoing validation. For each stage, we discuss the operational controls found in the recent academic literature to help AI service providers and developers reduce privacy risks while meeting legal standards. In addition, the framework includes design guidelines for children, drawing from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), the UK's Age-Appropriate Design Code (AADC), and recent academic research. To demonstrate how this framework can be applied in practice, we present a case study of an LLM-based educational tutor for children under 13. Through our analysis and the case study, we show that by using data protection strategies such as technical and organizational controls and making age-appropriate design decisions throughout the LLM life cycle, we can support the development of AI applications for children that provide privacy protections and comply with legal requirements.

Abstract: Innovation in Recommender Systems is currently impeded by a fractured ecosystem, where researchers must choose between the ease of in-memory experimentation and the costly, complex rewriting required for distributed industrial engines. To bridge this gap, we present WarpRec, a high-performance framework that eliminates this trade-off through a novel, backend-agnostic architecture. It includes 50+ state-of-the-art algorithms, 40 metrics, and 19 filtering and splitting strategies that seamlessly transition from local execution to distributed training and optimization. The framework enforces ecological responsibility by integrating CodeCarbon for real-time energy tracking, showing that scalability need not come at the cost of scientific integrity or sustainability. Furthermore, WarpRec anticipates the shift toward Agentic AI, leading Recommender Systems to evolve from static ranking engines into interactive tools within the Generative AI ecosystem. In summary, WarpRec not only bridges the gap between academia and industry but also can serve as the architectural backbone for the next generation of sustainable, agent-ready Recommender Systems.

Abstract: This work presents a practical benchmarking framework for optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) models on ARM Cortex processors (M0+, M4, M7), focusing on energy efficiency, accuracy, and resource utilization in embedded systems. Through the design of an automated test bench, we provide a systematic approach to evaluate across key performance indicators (KPIs) and identify optimal combinations of processor and AI model. The research highlights a nearlinear correlation between floating-point operations (FLOPs) and inference time, offering a reliable metric for estimating computational demands. Using Pareto analysis, we demonstrate how to balance trade-offs between energy consumption and model accuracy, ensuring that AI applications meet performance requirements without compromising sustainability. Key findings indicate that the M7 processor is ideal for short inference cycles, while the M4 processor offers better energy efficiency for longer inference tasks. The M0+ processor, while less efficient for complex AI models, remains suitable for simpler tasks. This work provides insights for developers, guiding them to design energy-efficient AI systems that deliver high performance in realworld applications.

Conclusion: KG-RAG在复杂电信场景中产生准确、可靠和可解释的输出方面表现出有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential across a variety of tasks, but their application in the telecom field remains challenging due to domain complexity, evolving standards, and specialized terminology. Therefore, general-domain LLMs may struggle to provide accurate and reliable outputs in this context, leading to increased hallucinations and reduced utility in telecom operations.To address these limitations, this work introduces KG-RAG-a novel framework that integrates knowledge graphs (KGs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance LLMs for telecom-specific tasks. In particular, the KG provides a structured representation of domain knowledge derived from telecom standards and technical documents, while RAG enables dynamic retrieval of relevant facts to ground the model's outputs. Such a combination improves factual accuracy, reduces hallucination, and ensures compliance with telecom specifications.Experimental results across benchmark datasets demonstrate that KG-RAG outperforms both LLM-only and standard RAG baselines, e.g., KG-RAG achieves an average accuracy improvement of 14.3% over RAG and 21.6% over LLM-only models. These results highlight KG-RAG's effectiveness in producing accurate, reliable, and explainable outputs in complex telecom scenarios.

Abstract: In multi-agent IR pipelines for tasks such as search and ranking, LLM-based agents exchange intermediate reasoning in terms of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with each other. Current CoT evaluation narrowly focuses on target task accuracy. However, this metric fails to assess the quality or utility of the reasoning process itself. To address this limitation, we introduce two novel measures: reusability and verifiability. We decouple CoT generation from execution using a Thinker-Executor framework. Reusability measures how easily an Executor can reuse the Thinker's CoT. Verifiability measures how frequently an Executor can match the Thinker's answer using the CoT. We evaluated four Thinker models against a committee of ten Executor models across five benchmarks. Our results reveal that reusability and verifiability do not correlate with standard accuracy, exposing a blind spot in current accuracy-based leaderboards for reasoning capability. Surprisingly, we find that CoTs from specialized reasoning models are not consistently more reusable or verifiable than those from general-purpose LLMs like Llama and Gemma.

Conclusion: KLong模型在解决超长周期任务方面具有优越性和泛化能力

Abstract: This paper introduces KLong, an open-source LLM agent trained to solve extremely long-horizon tasks. The principle is to first cold-start the model via trajectory-splitting SFT, then scale it via progressive RL training. Specifically, we first activate basic agentic abilities of a base model with a comprehensive SFT recipe. Then, we introduce Research-Factory, an automated pipeline that generates high-quality training data by collecting research papers and constructing evaluation rubrics. Using this pipeline, we build thousands of long-horizon trajectories distilled from Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking). To train with these extremely long trajectories, we propose a new trajectory-splitting SFT, which preserves early context, progressively truncates later context, and maintains overlap between sub-trajectories. In addition, to further improve long-horizon task-solving capability, we propose a novel progressive RL, which schedules training into multiple stages with progressively extended timeouts. Experiments demonstrate the superiority and generalization of KLong, as shown in Figure 1. Notably, our proposed KLong (106B) surpasses Kimi K2 Thinking (1T) by 11.28% on PaperBench, and the performance improvement generalizes to other coding benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and MLE-bench.

Abstract: Activation steering, or representation engineering, offers a lightweight approach to align large language models (LLMs) by manipulating their internal activations at inference time. However, current methods suffer from two key limitations: \textit{(i)} the lack of a unified theoretical framework for guiding the design of steering directions, and \textit{(ii)} an over-reliance on \textit{one-step steering} that fail to capture complex patterns of activation distributions. In this work, we propose a unified ordinary differential equations (ODEs)-based \textit{theoretical} framework for activation steering in LLM alignment. We show that conventional activation addition can be interpreted as a first-order approximation to the solution of an ODE. Based on this ODE perspective, identifying a steering direction becomes equivalent to designing a \textit{barrier function} from control theory. Derived from this framework, we introduce ODESteer, a kind of ODE-based steering guided by barrier functions, which shows \textit{empirical} advancement in LLM alignment. ODESteer identifies steering directions by defining the barrier function as the log-density ratio between positive and negative activations, and employs it to construct an ODE for \textit{multi-step and adaptive} steering. Compared to state-of-the-art activation steering methods, ODESteer achieves consistent empirical improvements on diverse LLM alignment benchmarks, a notable $5.7\%$ improvement over TruthfulQA, $2.5\%$ over UltraFeedback, and $2.4\%$ over RealToxicityPrompts. Our work establishes a principled new view of activation steering in LLM alignment by unifying its theoretical foundations via ODEs, and validating it empirically through the proposed ODESteer method.

Motivation: 针对噪声多语言历史文本中的人地关系提取，HIPE-2026是一个CLEF评估实验室。在HIPE-2020和HIPE-2022活动的基础上，它通过针对多语言和不同时间段的人地关联任务，扩展了语义关系提取的系列。

Method: 实验室引入了一个包含准确性、计算效率和领域泛化能力的三重评估配置文件，要求系统对两种关系进行分类：$at$（“这个人是否曾在这个地方？”）和$isAt$（“这个人在出版时是否位于这个地方？”），需要推理时间和地理线索。

Result: HIPE-2026通过将关系提取与大规模历史数据处理相结合，旨在支持知识图谱构建、历史传记重建和数字人文领域的空间分析等下游应用。

Conclusion: HIPE-2026是一个专注于从噪声多语言历史文本中提取人地关系的实验室，通过引入新的评估方法和目标，旨在推动知识图谱构建和数字人文领域的发展。

Abstract: HIPE-2026 is a CLEF evaluation lab dedicated to person-place relation extraction from noisy, multilingual historical texts. Building on the HIPE-2020 and HIPE-2022 campaigns, it extends the series toward semantic relation extraction by targeting the task of identifying person--place associations in multiple languages and time periods. Systems are asked to classify relations of two types - $at$ ("Has the person ever been at this place?") and $isAt$ ("Is the person located at this place around publication time?") - requiring reasoning over temporal and geographical cues. The lab introduces a three-fold evaluation profile that jointly assesses accuracy, computational efficiency, and domain generalization. By linking relation extraction to large-scale historical data processing, HIPE-2026 aims to support downstream applications in knowledge-graph construction, historical biography reconstruction, and spatial analysis in digital humanities.

We will use advanced and the latest available tech- nology offered by Tensorflow and Keras along with Microsoft-developed Vision Transformer, that can help to fight against the pandemic that the world has to fight together as a united. We focused on using the latest available CNN models (DenseNet201, Inception V3, VGG 19) and the Transformer model SWIN Transformer in order to prepare our hy- brid model that can provide a reliable solution as a helping hand for the physician in the medical field. In this research, we will discuss how the Federated learning-based Hybrid AI model can improve the accuracy of disease diagnosis and severity prediction of a patient using the real-time continual learning approach and how the integration of federated learn- ing can ensure hybrid model security and keep the authenticity of the information.

TL;DR: 提出了一种评估人工智能通用智能的新方法，即通过游戏进行评估，并介绍了AI游戏商店这一平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估人工智能在广泛的人类通用智能方面的能力变得越来越重要和具有挑战性。传统的AI基准通常只评估人类活动中有限范围内的狭窄能力。大多数基准也是静态的，随着开发者针对它们进行显式或隐式优化，它们很快就会饱和。

Method: 提出通过研究人工智能系统如何和如何有效地玩和学会玩所有可能的人类游戏来评估类似人类的通用智能。定义“人类游戏”为人类为人类设计的游戏，并论证所有此类游戏的空间——即“人类游戏多元宇宙”——的评估适用性。引入AI游戏商店，一个可扩展和开放的平台，使用人类在回路中的LLM来合成新的代表性人类游戏，通过自动获取和调整来自流行人类数字游戏平台的标准化和容器化游戏环境变体。

Result: 在基于苹果应用商店和Steam的顶级游戏的基础上生成了100种此类游戏，并在短游戏片段上评估了七种前沿视觉语言模型（VLM）。最好的模型在大多数游戏中的人均得分低于10%，特别是在挑战世界模型学习、记忆和计划的游戏中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 提出了一系列后续步骤，以构建AI游戏商店作为衡量和推动机器中类似人类通用智能进步的实用方法。

Abstract: Rigorously evaluating machine intelligence against the broad spectrum of human general intelligence has become increasingly important and challenging in this era of rapid technological advance. Conventional AI benchmarks typically assess only narrow capabilities in a limited range of human activity. Most are also static, quickly saturating as developers explicitly or implicitly optimize for them. We propose that a more promising way to evaluate human-like general intelligence in AI systems is through a particularly strong form of general game playing: studying how and how well they play and learn to play \textbf{all conceivable human games}, in comparison to human players with the same level of experience, time, or other resources. We define a "human game" to be a game designed by humans for humans, and argue for the evaluative suitability of this space of all such games people can imagine and enjoy -- the "Multiverse of Human Games". Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms. As a proof of concept, we generated 100 such games based on the top charts of Apple App Store and Steam, and evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short episodes of play. The best models achieved less than 10\% of the human average score on the majority of the games, and especially struggled with games that challenge world-model learning, memory and planning. We conclude with a set of next steps for building out the AI GameStore as a practical way to measure and drive progress toward human-like general intelligence in machines.

Abstract: Molecular generation with diffusion models has emerged as a promising direction for AI-driven drug discovery and materials science. While graph diffusion models have been widely adopted due to the discrete nature of 2D molecular graphs, existing models suffer from low chemical validity and struggle to meet the desired properties compared to 1D modeling. In this work, we introduce MolHIT, a powerful molecular graph generation framework that overcomes long-standing performance limitations in existing methods. MolHIT is based on the Hierarchical Discrete Diffusion Model, which generalizes discrete diffusion to additional categories that encode chemical priors, and decoupled atom encoding that splits the atom types according to their chemical roles. Overall, MolHIT achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the MOSES dataset with near-perfect validity for the first time in graph diffusion, surpassing strong 1D baselines across multiple metrics. We further demonstrate strong performance in downstream tasks, including multi-property guided generation and scaffold extension.
