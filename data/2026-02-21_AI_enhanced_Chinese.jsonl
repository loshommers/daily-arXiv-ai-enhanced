In this work, we investigate whether reference-guided LLM-evaluators can bridge this gap by serving as soft \"verifiers\". First, we design evaluation protocols that enhance LLM-based evaluators for LLM alignment using reference outputs. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that a reference-guided approach substantially improves the accuracy of less capable LLM-judges using references from frontier models; stronger LLM-judges can also be enhanced by high-quality (i.e., human-written) references. Building on these improved judges, we demonstrate the utility of high-quality references in alignment tuning, where LLMs guided with references are used as judges to self-improve. We show that reference-guided self-improvement yields clear gains over both direct SFT on reference outputs and self-improvement with reference-free judges, achieving performance comparable to training with ArmoRM, a strong finetuned reward model. Specifically, our method achieves 73.1% and 58.7% on AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard with Llama-3-8B-Instruct, and 70.0% and 74.1% with Qwen2.5-7B, corresponding to average absolute gains of +20.2 / +17.1 points over SFT distillation and +5.3 / +3.6 points over reference-free self-improvement on AlpacaEval / Arena-Hard.

However, these models demonstrate a training data bias towards a small number of popular languages or rely on transfer learning from high- to under-resourced languages; this may lead to a misrepresentation of social, cultural, and historical aspects. To address this challenge, monolingual LLMs have been developed for under-resourced languages; however, their effectiveness remains less studied when compared to multilingual counterparts on language-specific tasks. In this study, we address this research gap in Greek QA by contributing: (i) DemosQA, a novel dataset, which is constructed using social media user questions and community-reviewed answers to better capture the Greek social and cultural zeitgeist; (ii) a memory-efficient LLM evaluation framework adaptable to diverse QA datasets and languages; and (iii) an extensive evaluation of 11 monolingual and multilingual LLMs on 6 human-curated Greek QA datasets using 3 different prompting strategies.

Existing studies have primarily relied on aggregated, macroscopic traffic flow data to predict future traffic trends, whereas road traffic dynamics are also influenced by individual, microscopic human driving behaviors. Recent Connected Vehicle (CV) data provide rich driving behavior features, offering new opportunities to incorporate these behavioral insights into speed prediction. To this end, we propose the Macro-Micro Cross-Attention Transformer (MMCAformer) to integrate CV data-based micro driving behavior features with macro traffic features for speed prediction. Specifically, MMCAformer employs self-attention to learn intrinsic dependencies in macro traffic flow and cross-attention to capture spatiotemporal interplays between macro traffic status and micro driving behavior. MMCAformer is optimized with a Student-t negative log-likelihood loss to provide point-wise speed prediction and estimate uncertainty. Experiments on four Florida freeways demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MMCAformer compared to baselines. Compared with only using macro features, introducing micro driving behavior features not only enhances prediction accuracy (e.g., overall RMSE, MAE, and MAPE reduced by 9.0%, 6.9%, and 10.2%, respectively) but also shrinks model prediction uncertainty (e.g., mean predictive intervals decreased by 10.1-24.0% across the four freeways).

These limitations hinder transparency and reproducibility, amplified by the increasing adoption of AI- based methods. The AIdentifyAGE ontology is domain-specific and provides a standardized, semantically coherent framework, encompassing both manual and AI-assisted forensic dental age assessment workflows, and enabling traceable linkage between observations, methods, reference data, and reported outcomes. It models the complete medico-legal workflow, integrating judicial context, individual-level information, forensic examination data, dental developmental assessment methods, radiographic imaging, statistical reference studies, and AI-based estimation methods. It is being developed together with domain experts, and it builds on upper and established biomedical, dental, and machine learning ontologies, ensuring interoperability, extensibility, and compliance with FAIR principles.

The proposed method assesses both factual accuracy and content coverage through automatically generated questions and answers derived from the source document and the summary. A single multilingual instruction-tuned language model handles question generation, question answering, candidate answer extraction, and question importance weighting. This unified design reduces system complexity and computational cost. To capture semantic consistency beyond surface-level overlap, we use BERTScore-Recall for answer comparison. We validate BanglaSummEval on 300 human-written summaries from educational and medical domains, demonstrating strong correlation with expert human judgments (Pearson's $r = 0.694$, Spearman's $\u03c1= 0.763$).

In many settings, assortment and prices affect not only what an arriving customer buys but also how many customers arrive within the period, whereas classical multinomial logit (MNL) models assume arrivals as fixed, potentially leading to suboptimal decisions. We propose a Poisson-MNL model that couples a contextual MNL choice model with a Poisson arrival model whose rate depends on the offered assortment and prices. Building on this model, we develop an efficient algorithm PMNL based on the idea of upper confidence bound (UCB). We establish its (near) optimality by proving a non-asymptotic regret bound of order $\\sqrt{T\\log{T}}$ and a matching lower bound (up to $\\log T$).

In this paper, we present a large-scale multi-dimensional VQA dataset UltraVQA that encompasses diverse User-Generated Content~(UGC) annotated across five key quality dimensions: Motion Quality, Motion Amplitude, Aesthetic Quality, Content Quality, and Clarity Quality. Each video in our dataset is scored by over 3 human raters on these dimensions, with fine-grained sub-attribute labels, and accompanied by an explanatory rationale generated by GPT based on the collective human judgments. To better leverage these rich annotations and improve discrete quality score assessment, we introduce Analytic Score Optimization (ASO), a theoretically grounded post-training objective derived for multi-dimensional VQA. By reframing quality assessment as a regularized decision-making process, we obtain a closed-form solution that naturally captures the ordinal nature of human ratings, ensuring alignment with human ranking preferences. In experiments, our method outperforms most baselines including closed-source APIs and open-source models, while also reducing mean absolute error (MAE) in quality prediction.

Using historical data from the Texas electricity market, we demonstrate that this few-shot approach achieves performance comparable to supervised machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines and XGBoost, and outperforms the latter two when limited historical data are available.

However, Meenzerisch is on the verge of dying out-a fate it shares with many other German dialects. Natural language processing (NLP) has the potential to help with the preservation and revival efforts of languages and dialects. However, so far no NLP research has looked at Meenzerisch. This work presents the first research in the field of NLP that is explicitly focused on the dialect of Mainz. We introduce a digital dictionary-an NLP-ready dataset derived from an existing resource (Schramm, 1966)-to support researchers in modeling and benchmarking the language. It contains 2,351 words in the dialect paired with their meanings described in Standard German. We then use this dataset to answer the following research questions: (1) Can state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) generate definitions for dialect words? (2) Can LLMs generate words in Meenzerisch, given their definitions? Our experiments show that LLMs can do neither: the best model for definitions reaches only 6.27% accuracy and the best word generation model's accuracy is 1.51%. We then conduct two additional experiments in order to see if accuracy is improved by few-shot learning and by extracting rules from the training set, which are then passed to the LLM. While those approaches are able to improve the results, accuracy remains below 10%. This highlights that additional resources and an intensification of research efforts focused on German dialects are desperately needed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u6b21\u9488\u5bf9Mainz\u65b9\u8a00\u7684NLP\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0cLLMs\u5728\u65b9\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u4fdd\u62a4\u5e76\u590d\u5174\u5373\u5c06\u706d\u7edd\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u65b9\u8a00\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fMainz\u65b9\u8a00Meenzerisch\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u5b57\u8bcd\u5178\uff0c\u5305\u542b2,351\u4e2aMeenzerisch\u5355\u8bcd\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5fb7\u8bed\u4e2d\u7684\u542b\u4e49\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5NLP\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u8a00\u8bcd\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u65b9\u8a00\u8bcd\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5747\u4f4e\u4e8e10%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u52aa\u529b\u6765\u652f\u6301\u5fb7\u56fd\u65b9\u8a00\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002"}}

In isolation, we examine how well these datasets reflect real-world attacks based on three key properties: driven by ulterior intent, well-crafted, and out-of-distribution. We find that these datasets overrely on \"triggering cues\": words or phrases with overt negative/sensitive connotations that are intended to trigger safety mechanisms explicitly, which is unrealistic compared to real-world attacks. In practice, we evaluate whether these datasets genuinely measure safety risks or merely provoke refusals through triggering cues. To explore this, we introduce \"intent laundering\": a procedure that abstracts away triggering cues from attacks (data points) while strictly preserving their malicious intent and all relevant details. Our results indicate that current AI safety datasets fail to faithfully represent real-world attacks due to their overreliance on triggering cues. In fact, once these cues are removed, all previously evaluated \"reasonably safe\" models become unsafe, including Gemini 3 Pro and Claude Sonnet 3.7. Moreover, when intent laundering is adapted as a jailbreaking technique, it consistently achieves high attack success rates, ranging from 90% to over 98%, under fully black-box access.

While modern Vision-Language Models (VLM) have achieved high accuracy in this domain, they predominantly rely on autoregressive decoding, which becomes computationally expensive and slow for long documents as it requires a sequential forward pass for every generated token. We identify a key opportunity to overcome this bottleneck: unlike open-ended generation, OCR is a highly deterministic task where the visual input strictly dictates a unique output sequence, theoretically enabling efficient, parallel decoding via diffusion models. However, we show that existing masked diffusion models fail to harness this potential; those introduce structural instabilities that are benign in flexible tasks, like captioning, but catastrophic for the rigid, exact-match requirements of OCR. To bridge this gap, we introduce DODO, the first VLM to utilize block discrete diffusion and unlock its speedup potential for OCR. By decomposing generation into blocks, DODO mitigates the synchronization errors of global diffusion.

However, existing approaches mainly rely on post-crash features (e.g., crash type and severity) that are rarely available in real time, limiting their practical applicability. To address this limitation, we propose a hybrid secondary crash likelihood prediction framework that does not depend on post-crash features. A dynamic spatiotemporal window is designed to extract real-time traffic flow and environmental features from primary crash locations and their upstream segments. The framework includes three models: a primary crash model to estimate the likelihood of secondary crash occurrence, and two secondary crash models to evaluate traffic conditions at crash and upstream segments under different comparative scenarios. An ensemble learning strategy integrating six machine learning algorithms is developed to enhance predictive performance, and a voting-based mechanism combines the outputs of the three models.

Classical factorization methods, such as Trial Division and Pollard's Rho, are inefficient for large keys, while Shor's quantum algorithm can break RSA efficiently in polynomial time. This research studies RSA's vulnerabilities under both classical and quantum attacks and designs a hybrid security framework to ensure data protection in the post-quantum era. The conceptual framework combines AES encryption for classical security, BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for secure key exchange with eavesdropping detection, quantum state comparison for lightweight authentication, and a bio-inspired immune system for adaptive threat detection. RSA is vulnerable to Shor's algorithm, BB84 achieves full key agreement in ideal conditions, and it detects eavesdropping with high accuracy. The conceptual model includes both classical and quantum security methods, providing a scalable and adaptive solution for Post-Quantum encryption data protection.

Existing methods typically require labeled data from multiple training environments, limiting their applicability when labeled data are scarce. In this work, we study domain generalization in an anti-causal setting, where the outcome causes the observed covariates. Under this structure, environment perturbations that affect the covariates do not propagate to the outcome, which motivates regularizing the model's sensitivity to these perturbations. Crucially, estimating these perturbation directions does not require labels, enabling us to leverage unlabeled data from multiple environments. We propose two methods that penalize the model's sensitivity to variations in the mean and covariance of the covariates across environments, respectively, and prove that these methods have worst-case optimality guarantees under certain classes of environments.

Prior work shows that adversarial prompt manipulation can degrade large language model (LLM) performance in code generation. We test whether similar comment-based manipulation misleads LLMs during vulnerability detection. We build a 100-sample benchmark across Python, JavaScript, and Java, each paired with eight comment variants ranging from no comments to adversarial strategies such as authority spoofing and technical deception. Eight frontier models, five commercial and three open-source, are evaluated in 9,366 trials. Adversarial comments produce small, statistically non-significant effects on detection accuracy (McNemar exact p > 0.21; all 95 percent confidence intervals include zero). This holds for commercial models with 89 to 96 percent baseline detection and open-source models with 53 to 72 percent, despite large absolute performance gaps. Unlike generation settings where comment manipulation achieves high attack success, detection performance does not meaningfully degrade. More complex adversarial strategies offer no advantage over simple manipulative comments. We test four automated defenses across 4,646 additional trials (14,012 total). Static analysis cross-referencing performs best at 96.9 percent detection and recovers 47 percent of baseline misses.

Recent approaches leverage monocular foundation models with GRU-based iterative refinement for underwater adaptation; however, the sequential gating and local convolutional kernels in GRUs necessitate multiple iterations for long-range disparity propagation, limiting performance in large-disparity and textureless underwater regions. In this paper, we propose StereoAdapter-2, which replaces the conventional ConvGRU updater with a novel ConvSS2D operator based on selective state space models. The proposed operator employs a four-directional scanning strategy that naturally aligns with epipolar geometry while capturing vertical structural consistency, enabling efficient long-range spatial propagation within a single update step at linear computational complexity. Furthermore, we construct UW-StereoDepth-80K, a large-scale synthetic underwater stereo dataset featuring diverse baselines, attenuation coefficients, and scattering parameters through a two-stage generative pipeline combining semantic-aware style transfer and geometry-consistent novel view synthesis.

Classical maximum entropy methods provide principled uncertainty quantification from moment constraints but require sampling via MCMC or Langevin dynamics, which typically exhibit exponential slowdown in high dimensions. In contrast, generative models based on diffusion and flow matching efficiently transport noise to data but offer limited theoretical guarantees and can overfit when data is scarce. We introduce Moment Guided Diffusion (MGD), which combines elements of both approaches. Building on the stochastic interpolant framework, MGD samples maximum entropy distributions by solving a stochastic differential equation that guides moments toward prescribed values in finite time, thereby avoiding slow mixing in equilibrium-based methods. We formally obtain, in the large-volatility limit, convergence of MGD to the maximum entropy distribution and derive a tractable estimator of the resulting entropy computed directly from the dynamics.

Recent research has however showed that simple prompt injections embedded within a candidate document (i.e., jailbreak prompt attacks) can significantly alter an LLM's ranking decisions. While this poses serious security risks to LLM-based ranking pipelines, the extent to which this vulnerability persists across diverse LLM families, architectures, and settings remains largely under-explored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study of jailbreak prompt attacks against LLM rankers. We focus our evaluation on two complementary tasks: (1) Preference Vulnerability Assessment, measuring intrinsic susceptibility via attack success rate (ASR); and (2) Ranking Vulnerability Assessment, quantifying the operational impact on the ranking's quality (nDCG@10). We systematically examine three prevalent ranking paradigms (pairwise, listwise, setwise) under two injection variants: decision objective hijacking and decision criteria hijacking. Beyond reproducing prior findings, we expand the analysis to cover vulnerability scaling across model families, position sensitivity, backbone architectures, and cross-domain robustness. Our results characterize the boundary conditions of these vulnerabilities, revealing critical insights such as that encoder-decoder architectures exhibit strong inherent resilience to jailbreak attacks.

However, existing datasets exhibit Semantic Coverage Imbalance (SCI), a previously overlooked bias arising from the long-tailed semantic representations. Unlike class imbalance, SCI occurs at the semantic level, affecting how models learn and reason about rare yet meaningful semantics. To mitigate SCI, we propose Semantic Coverage-Aware Network (SemCovNet), a novel model that explicitly learns to correct semantic coverage disparities. SemCovNet integrates a Semantic Descriptor Map (SDM) for learning semantic representations, a Descriptor Attention Modulation (DAM) module that dynamically weights visual and concept features, and a Descriptor-Visual Alignment (DVA) loss that aligns visual features with descriptor semantics. We quantify semantic fairness using a Coverage Disparity Index (CDI), which measures the alignment between coverage and error. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SemCovNet enhances model reliability and substantially reduces CDI, achieving fairer and more equitable performance.

However, many benchmarks quickly become saturated, meaning that they can no longer differentiate between the best-performing models, diminishing their long-term value. In this study, we analyze benchmark saturation across 60 Large Language Model (LLM) benchmarks selected from technical reports by major model developers. To identify factors driving saturation, we characterize benchmarks along 14 properties spanning task design, data construction, and evaluation format. We test five hypotheses examining how each property contributes to saturation rates. Our analysis reveals that nearly half of the benchmarks exhibit saturation, with rates increasing as benchmarks age. Notably, hiding test data (i.e., public vs. private) shows no protective effect, while expert-curated benchmarks resist saturation better than crowdsourced ones.

This framework includes covariate balancing, nearest-neighbor matching, calibrated estimation, and density ratio estimation as special cases. A key design principle of the package is automatic regressor balancing (ARB): given a Bregman generator $g$ and a representer model class, genriesz} automatically constructs a compatible link function so that the generalized Riesz regression estimator satisfies balancing (moment-matching) optimality conditions in a user-chosen basis. The package provides a modulr interface for specifying (i) the target linear functional via a black-box evaluation oracle, (ii) the representer model via basis functions (polynomial, RKHS approximations, random forest leaf encodings, neural embeddings, and a nearest-neighbor catchment basis), and (iii) the Bregman generator, with optional user-supplied derivatives. It returns regression adjustment (RA), Riesz weighting (RW), augmented Riesz weighting (ARW), and TMLE-style estimators with cross-fitting, confidence intervals, and $p$-values.

However, achieving sample-efficient test-time self-consistency under a limited budget remains an open challenge. We introduce PETS (Principled and Efficient Test-TimeSelf-Consistency), which initiates a principled study of trajectory allocation through an optimization framework. Central to our approach is the self-consistency rate, a new measure defined as agreement with the infinite-budget majority vote. This formulation makes sample-efficient test-time allocation theoretically grounded and amenable to rigorous analysis. We study both offline and online settings. In the offline regime, where all questions are known in advance, we connect trajectory allocation to crowdsourcing, a classic and well-developed area, by modeling reasoning traces as workers. This perspective allows us to leverage rich existing theory, yielding theoretical guarantees and an efficient majority-voting-based allocation algorithm. In the online streaming regime, where questions arrive sequentially and allocations must be made on the fly, we propose a novel method inspired by the offline framework. Our approach adapts budgets to question difficulty while preserving strong theoretical guarantees and computational efficiency. Experiments show that PETS consistently outperforms uniform allocation. On GPQA, PETS achieves perfect self-consistency in both settings while reducing the sampling budget by up to 75% (offline) and 55% (online) relative to uniform allocation.

These properties make close reading indispensable while limiting reproducible comparison at scale. We present an uncertainty-aware computational framework for poet-level psychological analysis based on large-scale automatic multi-label annotation. Each verse is associated with a set of psychological concepts, per-label confidence scores, and an abstention flag that signals insufficient evidence. We aggregate confidence-weighted evidence into a Poet $\\times$ Concept matrix, interpret each poet as a probability distribution over concepts, and quantify poetic individuality as divergence from a corpus baseline using Jensen--Shannon divergence and Kullback--Leibler divergence. To capture relational structure beyond marginals, we build a confidence-weighted co-occurrence graph over concepts and define an Eigenmood embedding through Laplacian spectral decomposition. On a corpus of 61{,}573 verses across 10 poets, 22.2\\% of verses are abstained, underscoring the analytical importance of uncertainty. We further report sensitivity analysis under confidence thresholding, selection-bias diagnostics that treat abstention as a category, and a distant-to-close workflow that retrieves verse-level exemplars along Eigenmood axes. The resulting framework supports scalable, auditable digital-humanities analysis while preserving interpretive caution by propagating uncertainty from verse-level evidence to poet-level inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A key challenge in cryo-EM is characterizing continuous heterogeneity, where molecules adopt a continuum of conformational states. Covariance-based methods offer a principled approach to modeling structural variability. However, estimating the covariance matrix efficiently remains a challenging computational task. In this paper, we present SOLVAR (Stochastic Optimization for Low-rank Variability Analysis), which leverages a low-rank assumption on the covariance matrix to provide a tractable estimator for its principal components, despite the apparently prohibitive large size of the covariance matrix. Under this low-rank assumption, our estimator can be formulated as an optimization problem that can be solved quickly and accurately. Moreover, our framework enables refinement of the poses of the input particle images, a capability absent from most heterogeneity-analysis methods, and all covariance-based methods. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and experimental datasets demonstrate that the algorithm accurately captures dominant components of variability while maintaining computational efficiency.

HSI captures detailed biochemical features of produce, while 3D geometric data substantially improves morphological analysis. However, integrating these two modalities at scale remains challenging, as conventional approaches involve complex hardware setups incompatible with automated phenotyping systems. Recent advances in neural radiance fields (NeRF) offer computationally efficient 3D reconstruction but typically require moving-camera setups, limiting throughput and reproducibility in standard indoor agricultural environments. To address these challenges, we introduce HSI-SC-NeRF, a stationary-camera multi-channel NeRF framework for high-throughput hyperspectral 3D reconstruction targeting postharvest inspection of agricultural produce. Multi-view hyperspectral data is captured using a stationary camera while the object rotates within a custom-built Teflon imaging chamber providing diffuse, uniform illumination. Object poses are estimated via ArUco calibration markers and transformed to the camera frame of reference through simulated pose transformations, enabling standard NeRF training on stationary-camera data. A multi-channel NeRF formulation optimizes reconstruction across all hyperspectral bands jointly using a composite spectral loss, supported by a two-stage training protocol that decouples geometric initialization from radiometric refinement.

We present a geometric analysis of optimization dynamics in transformers trained on modular arithmetic. PCA of attention weight trajectories reveals that training evolves predominantly within a low-dimensional execution subspace, with a single principal component capturing 68-83% of trajectory variance. To probe loss-landscape geometry, we measure commutator defects -- the non-commutativity of successive gradient steps -- and project them onto this learned subspace. We find that curvature grows sharply in directions orthogonal to the execution subspace while the trajectory remains largely confined to it. Importantly, curvature growth consistently precedes generalization across learning rates and hyperparameter regimes, with the lead time obeying a power law in the grokking timescale. Causal intervention experiments show that motion along the learned subspace is necessary for grokking, while artificially increasing curvature is insufficient. Together, these results support a geometric account in which grokking reflects escape from a metastable regime characterized by low-dimensional confinement and transverse curvature accumulation. All findings replicate across this learning-rate range, a qualitatively different slow regime (lr=5e-5, wd=0.1, 3 layers), and three random seeds, though alignment dynamics differ quantitatively between regimes. Causal intervention experiments establish that orthogonal gradient flow is necessary but not sufficient for grokking: suppressing it prevents generalization with a monotonic dose-response across four operations, while artificially boosting curvature defects has no effect.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9Transformer\u4e2d\u7684Grokking\u73b0\u8c61\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Grokking\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u6709\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ece\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5230\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8f6c\u6362\u2014\u2014Grokking\u2014\u2014\u4ecd\u7136\u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u5728\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7b97\u672f\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Transformer\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e3b\u8981\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6267\u884c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u53ef\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u523068-83%\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5373Grokking\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u4ece\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u6a2a\u5411\u66f2\u7387\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6027\u4e9a\u7a33\u6001\u4e2d\u9003\u9038\u3002"}}

This inefficiency is largely due to the fixed tokenization process, which uses constant-sized patches throughout the entire denoising phase, regardless of the content's complexity. We propose dynamic tokenization, an efficient test-time strategy that varies patch sizes based on content complexity and the denoising timestep. Our key insight is that early timesteps only require coarser patches to model global structure, while later iterations demand finer (smaller-sized) patches to refine local details. During inference, our method dynamically reallocates patch sizes across denoising steps for image and video generation and substantially reduces cost while preserving perceptual generation quality.

Yet, existing approaches often rely on heavyweight fine-tuning that is costly to update, audit, and maintain across model families. Full fine-tuning incurs substantial computational and storage overhead, while parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA trade efficiency for inconsistent safety gains and sensitivity to design choices. Safety intervention mechanisms such as circuit breakers reduce unsafe outputs without modifying model weights, but do not directly shape or preserve the internal representations that govern safety behavior. These limitations hinder rapid and reliable safety updates, particularly in settings where models evolve frequently or must adapt to new policies and domains.\n  We present NeST, a lightweight, structure-aware safety alignment framework that strengthens refusal behavior by selectively adapting a small subset of safety-relevant neurons while freezing the remainder of the model. NeST aligns parameter updates with the internal organization of safety behavior by clustering functionally coherent safety neurons and enforcing shared updates within each cluster, enabling targeted and stable safety adaptation without broad model modification or inference-time overhead. We benchmark NeST against three dominant baselines: full fine-tuning, LoRA-based fine-tuning, and circuit breakers across 10 open-weight LLMs spanning multiple model families and sizes. Across all evaluated models, NeST reduces the attack success rate from an average of 44.5% to 4.36%, corresponding to a 90.2% reduction in unsafe generations, while requiring only 0.44 million trainable parameters on average. This amounts to a 17,310x decrease in updated parameters compared to full fine-tuning and a 9.25x reduction relative to LoRA, while consistently achieving stronger safety performance for alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeST\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLMs\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u91cd\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u5ba1\u8ba1\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aNeST\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u8c03\u6574\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51bb\u7ed3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5176\u4f59\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u6765\u52a0\u5f3a\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\u3002NeST\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u529f\u80fd\u4e0a\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5e76\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7c07\u5185\u6267\u884c\u5171\u4eab\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5c06\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b89\u5168\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0cNeST\u5c06\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece\u5e73\u574744.5%\u964d\u4f4e\u52304.36%\uff0c\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u751f\u6210\u768490.2%\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u800c\u5e73\u5747\u4ec5\u9700\u8981440\u4e07\u4e2a\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u8fd9\u6bd4\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8617,310\u500d\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6bd4LoRA\u51cf\u5c11\u4e869.25\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u59cb\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "NeST\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u751f\u6210\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9700\u6c42\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3aLLMs\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

PRIMO enables the use of all available training examples, whether modalities are complete or partial. Specifically, it models the missing modality through a latent variable that captures its relationship with the observed modality in the context of prediction. During inference, we draw many samples from the learned distribution over the missing modality to both obtain the marginal predictive distribution (for the purpose of prediction) and analyze the impact of the missing modalities on the prediction for each instance. We evaluate PRIMO on a synthetic XOR dataset, Audio-Vision MNIST, and MIMIC-III for mortality and ICD-9 prediction. Across all datasets, PRIMO obtains performance comparable to unimodal baselines when a modality is fully missing and to multimodal baselines when all modalities are available.

Data transmission, latency, energy consumption, and dependence on large data centres create bottlenecks that scale poorly across heterogeneous, mobile, and resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we introduce Node Learning, a decen- tralised learning paradigm in which intelligence resides at individual edge nodes and expands through selective peer interaction. Nodes learn continuously from local data, maintain their own model state, and exchange learned knowledge opportunistically when collaboration is beneficial. Learning propagates through overlap and diffusion rather than global synchro- nisation or central aggregation. It unifies autonomous and cooperative behaviour within a single abstraction and accommodates heterogeneity in data, hardware, objectives, and connectivity. This concept paper develops the conceptual foundations of this paradigm, contrasts it with existing decentralised approaches, and examines implications for communi- cation, hardware, trust, and governance.

However, theoretical work in the field suggests that first-personal interaction is a crucial part of ToM and that such predictive, spectatorial tasks may fail to evaluate it. We address this gap with a novel ToM task that requires an agent to persuade a target to choose one of three policy proposals by strategically revealing information. Success depends on a persuader's sensitivity to a given target's knowledge states (what the target knows about the policies) and motivational states (how much the target values different outcomes). We varied whether these states were Revealed to persuaders or Hidden, in which case persuaders had to inquire about or infer them. In Experiment 1, participants persuaded a bot programmed to make only rational inferences. LLMs excelled in the Revealed condition but performed below chance in the Hidden condition, suggesting difficulty with the multi-step planning required to elicit and use mental state information. Humans performed moderately well in both conditions, indicating an ability to engage such planning. In Experiment 2, where a human target role-played the bot, and in Experiment 3, where we measured whether human targets' real beliefs changed, LLMs outperformed human persuaders across all conditions. These results suggest that effective persuasion can occur without explicit ToM reasoning (e.g., through rhetorical strategies) and that LLMs excel at this form of persuasion. Overall, our results caution against attributing human-like ToM to LLMs while highlighting LLMs' potential to influence people's beliefs and behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This has led to increased use of third-party hosting services. However, in this setting, there is a lack of guarantees on the computation performed by the inference provider. For example, a dishonest provider may replace an expensive large model with a cheaper-to-run weaker model and return the results from the weaker model to the user. Existing tools to verify inference typically rely on methods from cryptography such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), but these add significant computational overhead, and remain infeasible for use for large models. In this work, we develop a new insight -- that given a method for performing private LLM inference, one can obtain forms of verified inference at marginal extra cost. Specifically, we propose two new protocols which leverage privacy-preserving LLM inference in order to provide guarantees over the inference that was carried out. Our approaches are cheap, requiring the addition of a few extra tokens of computation, and have little to no downstream impact. As the fastest privacy-preserving inference methods are typically faster than ZK methods, the proposed protocols also improve verification runtime.

These alternatives require accurate propagation of satellite position and velocity with a realistic quantification of uncertainty. It is commonly assumed that the propagated uncertainty distribution is Gaussian; however, the validity of this assumption can be quickly compromised by the mismodeling of atmospheric drag. We develop a machine learning approach that corrects error growth in the argument of latitude for a diverse set of LEO satellites. The improved orbit propagation accuracy extends the applicability of the Gaussian assumption and modeling of the errors with a corrected mean and covariance. We compare the performance of a time-conditioned neural network and a Gaussian Process on datasets computed with an open source orbit propagator and publicly available Vector Covariance Message (VCM) ephemerides. The learned models predict the argument of latitude error as a Gaussian distribution given parameters from a single VCM epoch and reverse propagation errors. We show that this one-dimensional model captures the effect of mismodeled drag, which can be mapped to the Cartesian state space. The correction method only updates information along the dimensions of dominant error growth, while maintaining the physics-based propagation of VCM covariance in the remaining dimensions. We therefore extend the utility of VCM ephemerides to longer time horizons without modifying the functionality of the existing propagator.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper proposes a unified framework, where each score is explicitly defined with respect to a given order. This order-oriented perspective enables more flexible and coherent scoring mechanisms. We examine several classical orders on hesitant fuzzy elements, that is, nonempty subsets in [0,1], and show that, contrary to prior claims, they do not induce lattice structures. In contrast, we prove that the scores defined with respect to the symmetric order satisfy key normative criteria for scoring functions, including strong monotonicity with respect to unions and the G\u00e4rdenfors condition.\n  Following this analysis, we introduce a class of functions, called dominance functions, for ranking hesitant fuzzy elements. They aim to compare hesitant fuzzy elements relative to control sets incorporating minimum acceptability thresholds. Two concrete examples of dominance functions for finite sets are provided: the discrete dominance function and the relative dominance function. We show that these can be employed to construct fuzzy preference relations on typical hesitant fuzzy sets and support group decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This study investigates how different approaches for cross-lingual text classification can support reliable analysis of global conversations. Using hydrogen energy as a case study, we analyse a decade-long dataset of over nine million tweets in English, Japanese, Hindi, and Korean (2013--2022) for topic discovery. The online keyword-driven data collection results in a significant amount of irrelevant content. We explore four approaches to filter relevant content: (1) translating English annotated data into target languages for building language-specific models for each target language, (2) translating unlabelled data appearing from all languages into English for creating a single model based on English annotations, (3) applying English fine-tuned multilingual transformers directly to each target language data, and (4) a hybrid strategy that combines translated annotations with multilingual training. Each approach is evaluated for its ability to filter hydrogen-related tweets from noisy keyword-based collections. Subsequently, topic modeling is performed to extract dominant themes within the relevant subsets.

We present a categorical and Grothendieck-topological model of \u03a3-protocols, providing a formal structural interpretation of interactive proof systems, knowledge soundness, and attacker models", "summary": "Cryptographic security is traditionally formulated using game-based or simulation-based definitions. In this paper, we propose a structural reformulation of cryptographic security based on Grothendieck topologies and sheaf theory.\n  Our key idea is to model attacker observations as a Grothendieck site, where covering families represent admissible decompositions of partial information determined by efficient simulation. Within this framework, protocol transcripts naturally form sheaves, and security properties arise as geometric conditions.\n  As a first step, we focus on $\u03a3$-protocols.

We present PartRAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that integrates an external part database with a diffusion transformer to couple generation with an editable representation. To overcome the first challenge, we introduce a Hierarchical Contrastive Retrieval module that aligns dense image patches with 3D part latents at both part and object granularity, retrieving from a curated bank of 1,236 part-annotated assets to inject diverse, physically plausible exemplars into denoising. To overcome the second challenge, we add a masked, part-level editor that operates in a shared canonical space, enabling swaps, attribute refinements, and compositional updates without regenerating the whole object while preserving non-target parts and multi-view consistency. PartRAG achieves competitive results on Objaverse, ShapeNet, and ABO-reducing Chamfer Distance from 0.1726 to 0.1528 and raising F-Score from 0.7472 to 0.844 on Objaverse-with inference of 38s and interactive edits in 5-8s.

Importantly, we identify that the resulting omitted variable bias from unobserved variables can compromise both evaluation and optimization in language models. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework that maps the strength of the omitted variables to bounds on the worst-case generalization performance of language models under distribution shift. In empirical experiments, we show that using these bounds directly in language model evaluation and optimization provides more principled measures of out-of-distribution performance, improves true out-of-distribution performance relative to standard distribution shift adjustment methods, and further enables inference about the strength of the omitted variables when target distribution labels are available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u5206\u4e3a\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u754c\u9650\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Building on this, we develop Amber-Image-6B by introducing a hybrid-stream architecture that converts deep-layer dual streams into a single stream initialized from the image branch, further refined via progressive distillation and lightweight fine-tuning. Our approach reduces parameters by 70% and eliminates the need for large-scale data engineering. Notably, the entire compression and training pipeline-from the 10B to the 6B variant-requires fewer than 2,000 GPU hours, demonstrating exceptional cost-efficiency compared to training from scratch.

Without requiring labeled counterfactual data, DCC verifies a model's ability to execute two important elements of causal reasoning: causal intervention and counterfactual prediction. Using DCC, we evaluate the causal reasoning abilities of various leading LLMs across a range of reasoning tasks and interventions. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DCC as a training-free test-time rejection sampling criterion and show that it can directly improve performance on reasoning tasks across multiple model families.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cDCC\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u9762\u5bf9\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53cc\u91cd\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08DCC\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8861\u91cf\u548c\u6307\u5bfcLLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002DCC\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b83\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4e24\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1a\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528DCC\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u9886\u5148LLMs\u5728\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86DCC\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DCC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u63d0\u9ad8LLMs\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, these models still exhibit low accuracy in core banking computations-including total payout estimation, comparison of products with varying interest rates, and interest calculation under early repayment conditions. Such tasks require multi-step numerical reasoning and contextual understanding of banking products, yet existing LLMs often make systematic errors-misinterpreting product types, applying conditions incorrectly, or failing basic calculations involving exponents and geometric progressions. However, such errors have rarely been captured by existing benchmarks. Mathematical datasets focus on fundamental math problems, whereas financial benchmarks primarily target financial documents, leaving everyday banking scenarios underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose BankMathBench, a domain-specific dataset that reflects realistic banking tasks. BankMathBench is organized in three levels of difficulty-basic, intermediate, and advanced-corresponding to single-product reasoning, multi-product comparison, and multi-condition scenarios, respectively. When trained on BankMathBench, open-source LLMs exhibited notable improvements in both formula generation and numerical reasoning accuracy, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in enhancing domain-specific reasoning. With tool-augmented fine-tuning, the models achieved average accuracy increases of 57.6%p (basic), 75.1%p (intermediate), and 62.9%p (advanced), representing significant gains over zero-shot baselines.

We present a theoretical framework for modular generative modeling where a set of pre-trained experts are combined via a gating mechanism. We define the space of normalized gating functions, $G_{1}$, and formulate the problem as a minimax game to find a single robust gate that minimizes divergence to the worst-case data mixture. We prove the existence of such a robust gate using Kakutani's fixed-point theorem and show that modularity acts as a strong regularizer, with generalization bounds scaling with the lightweight gate's complexity. Furthermore, we prove that this modular approach can theoretically outperform models retrained on aggregate data, with the gap characterized by the Jensen-Shannon Divergence.

Unlike disembodied AI, failures in embodied intelligence lead to irreversible physical consequences, raising fundamental questions about security, safety, and reliability. While existing research predominantly analyzes embodied AI through the lenses of Large Language Model (LLM) vulnerabilities or classical Cyber-Physical System (CPS) failures, this survey argues that these perspectives are individually insufficient to explain many observed breakdowns in modern embodied systems. We posit that a significant class of failures arises from embodiment-induced system-level mismatches, rather than from isolated model flaws or traditional CPS attacks. Specifically, we identify four core insights that explain why embodied AI is fundamentally harder to secure: (i) semantic correctness does not imply physical safety, as language-level reasoning abstracts away geometry, dynamics, and contact constraints; (ii) identical actions can lead to drastically different outcomes across physical states due to nonlinear dynamics and state uncertainty; (iii) small errors propagate and amplify across tightly coupled perception-decision-action loops; and (iv) safety is not compositional across time or system layers, enabling locally safe decisions to accumulate into globally unsafe behavior.

Our method relies on insights about grader failure in solver-grader pipelines, which we call the Cognitive Well (iterative refinement converging to a wrong solution that the solver as well as the pipeline's internal grader consider to be basically correct).

However, current ADKs either lack sufficient functional support or rely on humans to manually design these components, limiting agents' generalizability and overall performance. We propose OpenSage, the first ADK that enables LLMs to automatically create agents with self-generated topology and toolsets while providing comprehensive and structured memory support. OpenSage offers effective functionality for agents to create and manage their own sub-agents and toolkits. It also features a hierarchical, graph-based memory system for efficient management and a specialized toolkit tailored to software engineering tasks. Extensive experiments across three state-of-the-art benchmarks with various backbone models demonstrate the advantages of OpenSage over existing ADKs. We also conduct rigorous ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our design for each component. We believe OpenSage can pave the way for the next generation of agent development, shifting the focus from human-centered to AI-centered paradigms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While statistical watermarking has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: the lack of a principled approach for selecting sampling distributions and the reliance on fixed-horizon hypothesis testing, which precludes valid early stopping. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing the first e-value-based watermarking framework, Anchored E-Watermarking, that unifies optimal sampling with anytime-valid inference. Unlike traditional approaches where optional stopping invalidates Type-I error guarantees, our framework enables valid, anytime-inference by constructing a test supermartingale for the detection process. By leveraging an anchor distribution to approximate the target model, we characterize the optimal e-value with respect to the worst-case log-growth rate and derive the optimal expected stopping time. Our theoretical claims are substantiated by simulations and evaluations on established benchmarks, showing that our framework can significantly enhance sample efficiency, reducing the average token budget required for detection by 13-15% relative to state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Anchored E-Watermarking\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6765\u533a\u5206\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6587\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8ee-value\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u6846\u67b6Anchored E-Watermarking\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u6700\u4f18\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u7b97\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8613-15%\u3002", "conclusion": "Anchored E-Watermarking\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u533a\u5206\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

When only parts of a document are sensitive, providers who want to avoid leaking protected information typically must manually redact documents before sharing them, which is costly, coarse-grained, and hard to maintain as policies or partners change. We present DAVE, a usage policy-enforcing LLM spokesperson that answers questions over private documents on behalf of a data provider. Instead of releasing documents, the provider exposes a natural language interface whose responses are constrained by machine-readable usage policies. We formalize policy-violating information disclosure in this setting, drawing on usage control and information flow security, and introduce virtual redaction: suppressing sensitive information at query time without modifying source documents. We describe an architecture for integrating such a spokesperson with Eclipse Dataspace Components and ODRL-style policies, and outline an initial provider-side integration prototype in which QA requests are routed through a spokesperson service instead of triggering raw document transfer.

This makes ports particularly detrimental to geometry-based downstream pipelines such as image stitching, 3D reconstruction, and visual SLAM, where dynamic or non-anatomical outliers degrade alignment and tracking stability. Despite this practical importance, explicit port labels are rare in public surgical datasets, and existing annotations often violate geometric consistency by masking the central lumen (opening), even when anatomical regions are visible through it. We present Cholec80-port, a high-fidelity trocar port segmentation dataset derived from Cholec80, together with a rigorous standard operating procedure (SOP) that defines a port-sleeve mask excluding the central opening.

Existing entropy-regularized methods primarily maximize expected reward, providing no mechanism to shape tail behavior. However, tail control is often essential: the lower tail determines reliability by limiting low-reward failures, while the upper tail enables discovery by prioritizing rare, high-reward outcomes. In this work, we present Tail-aware Flow Fine-Tuning (TFFT), a principled and efficient distributional fine-tuning algorithm based on the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). We address two distinct tail-shaping goals: right-CVaR for seeking novel samples in the high-reward tail and left-CVaR for controlling worst-case samples in the low-reward tail. Unlike prior approaches that rely on non-linear optimization, we leverage the variational dual formulation of CVaR to decompose it into a decoupled two-stage procedure: a lightweight one-dimensional threshold optimization step, and a single entropy-regularized fine-tuning process via a specific pseudo-reward. This decomposition achieves CVaR fine-tuning efficiently with computational cost comparable to standard expected fine-tuning methods.

Traditional benchmarks measure transient task accuracy but fail to capture stable, latent response policies -- the ``prevailing mindsets'' embedded during training and alignment that outlive individual model versions.\n  This paper introduces a novel auditing framework that utilizes psychometric measurement theory -- specifically latent trait estimation under ordinal uncertainty -- to quantify these tendencies without relying on ground-truth labels. Utilizing forced-choice ordinal vignettes masked by semantically orthogonal decoys and governed by cryptographic permutation-invariance, the research audits nine leading models across dimensions including Optimization Bias, Sycophancy, and Status-Quo Legitimization.\n  Using Mixed Linear Models (MixedLM) and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) analysis, the research identifies that while item-level framing drives high variance, a persistent ``lab signal'' accounts for significant behavioral clustering. These findings demonstrate that in ``locked-in'' provider ecosystems, latent biases are not merely static errors but compounding variables that risk creating recursive ideological echo chambers in multi-layered AI architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4ece\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u804a\u5929\u754c\u9762\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u9012\u5f52\u8bc4\u4f30\u5faa\u73af\uff08LLM-as-a-judge\uff09\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u63a8\u7406\u5c42\u65f6\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6301\u4e45\u3001\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\u2014\u2014\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\u662f\u5e8f\u6570\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u8d28\u4f30\u8ba1\u2014\u2014\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5e8f\u6570\u60c5\u666f\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u4ea4\u7684\u8bf1\u9975\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u6392\u5217\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4e86\u5305\u62ec\u4f18\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u8c04\u5a9a\u548c\u73b0\u72b6\u5408\u6cd5\u5316\u5728\u5185\u7684\u4e5d\u4e2a\u9876\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u9879\u76ee\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\u9a71\u52a8\u4e86\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u201c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u4fe1\u53f7\u201d\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u805a\u7c7b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u201c\u9501\u5b9a\u201d\u7684\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u6f5c\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u9759\u6001\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5728\u591a\u5c42AI\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u521b\u5efa\u9012\u5f52\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u56de\u97f3\u5ba4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u9012\u5f52\u8bc4\u4f30\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u6301\u4e45\u3001\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u91cf\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u5728\u591a\u5c42AI\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Internally, systems use cheap checks, such as self-consistency or proxy rewards, which we call weak verification. Externally, users inspect outputs and steer the model through feedback until results are trustworthy, which we call strong verification. These signals differ sharply in cost and reliability: strong verification can establish trust but is resource-intensive, while weak verification is fast and scalable but noisy and imperfect. We formalize this tension through weak--strong verification policies, which decide when to accept or reject based on weak verification and when to defer to strong verification. We introduce metrics capturing incorrect acceptance, incorrect rejection, and strong-verification frequency. Over population, we show that optimal policies admit a two-threshold structure and that calibration and sharpness govern the value of weak verifiers.

Unlike zkVMs (zero-knowledge virtual machines), which emulate CPU instruction execution, Jolt Atlas adapts Jolt's lookup-centric approach and applies it directly to ONNX tensor operations. The ONNX computational model eliminates the need for CPU registers and simplifies memory consistency verification. In addition, ONNX is an open-source, portable format, which makes it easy to share and deploy models across different frameworks, hardware platforms, and runtime environments without requiring framework-specific conversions.\n  Our lookup arguments, which use sumcheck protocol, are well-suited for non-linear functions -- key building blocks in modern ML. We apply optimisations such as neural teleportation to reduce the size of lookup tables while preserving model accuracy, as well as several tensor-level verification optimisations detailed in this paper. We demonstrate that Jolt Atlas can prove model inference in memory-constrained environments -- a prover property commonly referred to as \\textit{streaming}. Furthermore, we discuss how Jolt Atlas achieves zero-knowledge through the BlindFold technique, as introduced in Vega. In contrast to existing zkML frameworks, we show practical proving times for classification, embedding, automated reasoning, and small language models.\n  Jolt Atlas enables cryptographic verification that can be run on-device, without specialised hardware. The resulting proofs are succinctly verifiable. This makes Jolt Atlas well-suited for privacy-centric and adversarial environments. In a companion work, we outline various use cases of Jolt Atlas, including how it serves as guardrails in agentic commerce and for trustless AI context (often referred to as \\textit{AI memory}).", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To explicitly embed physical processes into the learning framework, we identify two critical factors governing pollutant dynamics: topography and wind direction. Complex terrain can channel, block, and trap pollutants, while wind acts as a primary driver of their transport and dispersion. Building on these insights, TopoFlow leverages a vision transformer architecture with two novel mechanisms: topography-aware attention, which explicitly models terrain-induced flow patterns, and wind-guided patch reordering, which aligns spatial representations with prevailing wind directions. Trained on six years of high-resolution reanalysis data assimilating observations from over 1,400 surface monitoring stations across China, TopoFlow achieves a PM2.5 RMSE of 9.71 ug/m3, representing a 71-80% improvement over operational forecasting systems and a 13% improvement over state-of-the-art AI baselines. Forecast errors remain well below China's 24-hour air quality threshold of 75 ug/m3 (GB 3095-2012), enabling reliable discrimination between clean and polluted conditions.

Our analysis shows that world knowledge is a necessary ingredient for success, but only up to a point, beyond this threshold, planning and long-horizon reasoning capabilities become the dominant factors.

Existing verification methods are often impractical: formal tools are too restrictive, while black-box statistical auditing is intractable for complex pipelines and fails to pinpoint the source of the bug. This paper introduces Re:cord-play, a gray-box auditing paradigm that inspects the internal state of DP algorithms. By running an instrumented algorithm on neighboring datasets with identical randomness, Re:cord-play directly checks for data-dependent control flow and provides concrete falsification of sensitivity violations by comparing declared sensitivity against the empirically measured distance between internal inputs.

In particular, faint GRBs originating from a distant universe may provide unique insights into the early stages of star formation. However, detecting and localizing such weak sources remains challenging owing to low photon statistics and substantial background noise. Although recent machine learning models address individual aspects of these challenges, they often struggle to balance the trade-off between statistical robustness and noise suppression. Consequently, we propose ComptonUNet, a hybrid deep learning framework that jointly processes raw data and reconstructs images for robust GRB localization. ComptonUNet was designed to operate effectively under conditions of limited photon statistics and strong background contamination by combining the statistical efficiency of direct reconstruction models with the denoising capabilities of image-based architectures. We perform realistic simulations of GRB-like events embedded in background environments representative of low-Earth orbit missions to evaluate the performance of ComptonUNet.

Yet these instruments presume honest responding; in evaluative contexts, LLMs can instead gravitate toward socially preferred answers-a form of socially desirable responding (SDR)-biasing questionnaire-derived scores and downstream conclusions. We propose a psychometric framework to quantify and mitigate SDR in questionnaire-based evaluation of LLMs. To quantify SDR, the same inventory is administered under HONEST versus FAKE-GOOD instructions, and SDR is computed as a direction-corrected standardized effect size from item response theory (IRT)-estimated latent scores. This enables comparisons across constructs and response formats, as well as against human instructed-faking benchmarks. For mitigation, we construct a graded forced-choice (GFC) Big Five inventory by selecting 30 cross-domain pairs from an item pool via constrained optimization to match desirability. Across nine instruction-tuned LLMs evaluated on synthetic personas with known target profiles, Likert-style questionnaires show consistently large SDR, whereas desirability-matched GFC substantially attenuates SDR while largely preserving the recovery of the intended persona profiles.

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and its variants have achieved impressive rendering fidelity while maintaining high computational and memory efficiency. However, conventional vision-based GS pipelines typically rely on a sufficient number of camera views to initialize the Gaussian primitives and train their parameters, typically incurring additional processing cost during initialization while falling short in conditions where visual cues are unreliable, such as adverse weather, low illumination, or partial occlusions. To cope with these challenges, and motivated by the robustness of radio-frequency (RF) signals to weather, lighting, and occlusions, we introduce a multimodal framework that integrates RF sensing, such as automotive radar, with GS-based rendering as a more efficient and robust alternative to vision-only GS rendering. The proposed approach enables efficient depth prediction from only sparse RF-based depth measurements, yielding a high-quality 3D point cloud for initializing Gaussian functions across diverse GS architectures. Numerical tests demonstrate the merits of judiciously incorporating RF sensing into GS pipelines, achieving high-fidelity 3D scene rendering driven by RF-informed structural accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408RF\u4f20\u611f\u548cGS\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad83D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad83D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u4f4e\u5149\u7167\u6216\u90e8\u5206\u906e\u6321\u3002\u53d7\u5c04\u9891\uff08RF\uff09\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u5149\u7167\u548c\u906e\u6321\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u542f\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06RF\u4f20\u611f\uff08\u5982\u6c7d\u8f66\u96f7\u8fbe\uff09\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eGS\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u7684RF\u6df1\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684GS\u67b6\u6784\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f3D\u70b9\u4e91\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c06RF\u4f20\u611f\u5de7\u5999\u5730\u878d\u5165GS\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u53473D\u573a\u666f\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u9a71\u52a8RF\u4fe1\u606f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a3D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002"}}

X-Value consists of more than 5,000 QA pairs across 18 languages, systematically organized into 7 core domains grounded in Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values and categorized into easy and hard levels for discriminative evaluation. We further propose a unique two-stage annotation framework that first identifies whether an issue falls under global consensus (e.g., human rights) or pluralism (e.g., religion), and subsequently conducts a multi-party evaluation of the latent values embedded within the content. Systematic evaluations on X-Value reveal that current SOTA LLMs exhibit deficiencies in cross-lingual values assessment ($Acc < 77\\%$), with significant performance disparities across different languages ($\u0394Acc > 20\\%$).

The algorithm relies on drawing tokens according to the Boltzmann distribution, serving as an extension and improvement of the Random Draw method. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in bounding the number of selected input tokens as well as reducing dust generation and limiting the token pool size in the wallet. Moreover, the probabilistic algorithm can be implemented efficiently, improves performance and respects privacy requirements - properties of significant relevance for current token-based technologies. We compare the Boltzmann draw to both the standard Random Draw and the Greedy algorithm. We argue that the former is superior to the latter in the sense of the above objectives.

However, existing methods rely on predefined camera viewpoints, ground-truth labels, or costly retraining, making them impractical for low-latency use. We propose B$^3$-Seg (Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian Segmentation for 3DGS), a fast and theoretically grounded method for open-vocabulary 3DGS segmentation under camera-free and training-free conditions. Our approach reformulates segmentation as sequential Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian updates and actively selects the next view via analytic Expected Information Gain (EIG).

We test this prediction across neural networks trained with noisy labels (30 datasets, 2,700 runs), human probabilistic reversal learning (N = 292), and human reward/punishment learning with concurrent EEG (N = 25). In each system, truth is defined operationally: held-out labels, the objectively correct option, or the participant's pre-feedback expectation - the only non-circular reference decodable from post-feedback EEG. The gap appeared universally but was regulated differently: dense networks accumulated it as memorization; sparse-residual scaffolding suppressed it; humans generated transient over-commitment that was actively recovered. Neural over-commitment (~0.04-0.10) was amplified tenfold into behavioral commitment (d = 3.3-3.9).

A standard next-token prediction training strategy, while widely adopted in practice, may lead to overlooked artifacts such as representation collapse. Previous works have shown that this problem is especially pronounced in the representation of the deeper Transformer layers, where it often fails to efficiently utilize the geometric space. Representation collapse is even more evident in end-to-end training of continuous-output neural machine translation, where the trivial solution would be to set all vectors to the same value. In this work, we analyze the dynamics of representation collapse at different levels of discrete and continuous NMT transformers throughout training. We incorporate an existing regularization method based on angular dispersion and demonstrate empirically that it not only mitigates collapse but also improves translation quality.

Existing methods often fail under strong detection or continuous fine-tuning, largely due to (1) cross-modal inconsistency that exposes trigger patterns and (2) gradient dilution at low poisoning rates that accelerates backdoor forgetting. These coupled causes remain insufficiently modeled and addressed. We propose BadCLIP++, a unified framework that tackles both challenges. For stealthiness, we introduce a semantic-fusion QR micro-trigger that embeds imperceptible patterns near task-relevant regions, preserving clean-data statistics while producing compact trigger distributions. We further apply target-aligned subset selection to strengthen signals at low injection rates. For persistence, we stabilize trigger embeddings via radius shrinkage and centroid alignment, and stabilize model parameters through curvature control and elastic weight consolidation, maintaining solutions within a low-curvature wide basin resistant to fine-tuning. We also provide the first theoretical analysis showing that, within a trust region, gradients from clean fine-tuning and backdoor objectives are co-directional, yielding a non-increasing upper bound on attack success degradation.

We propose Verbalized Action Masking (VAM), which verbalizes an action mask in the prompt and enforces that the model outputs an action from the masked set. Building on this interface, we introduce iterative action-space pruning: if the target action is not sampled, we remove valid sampled actions from the mask and resample under the reduced candidate set, repeating until the target is sampled or a fixed budget is exhausted. We study VAM in chess and evaluate it under two training regimes: an engine-play regime that generates states via play against an engine opponent and a fixed-dataset regime that trains from a fixed dataset of positions with verifier scores. Across held-out chess puzzles and full-game play measured by average centipawn loss (ACPL), VAM improves learning efficiency and final performance over strong baselines, highlighting verbalized masking as a practical mechanism for controllable exploration in LLM RL post-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "VAM\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u5316\u63a9\u7801\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLM RL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u5927\u578b\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u65e9\u9677\u5165\u91cd\u590d\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aVAM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u8868\u8fbe\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u63a9\u7801\u96c6\u4e2d\u8f93\u51fa\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u526a\u679d\uff1a\u5982\u679c\u76ee\u6807\u52a8\u4f5c\u6ca1\u6709\u88ab\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5219\u4ece\u63a9\u7801\u4e2d\u5220\u9664\u6709\u6548\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u5019\u9009\u96c6\u4e0b\u91cd\u65b0\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u91cd\u590d\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u88ab\u91c7\u6837\u6216\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u8017\u5c3d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8c61\u68cb\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76\u4e86VAM\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u5f15\u64ce\u5bf9\u624b\u8fdb\u884c\u6e38\u620f\u751f\u6210\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5f15\u64ce\u6e38\u620f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u4ece\u5177\u6709\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5206\u6570\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u8c61\u68cb\u8c1c\u9898\u548c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u5747\u767e\u6b65\u635f\u5931\uff08ACPL\uff09\u8861\u91cf\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6e38\u620f\u73a9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0cVAM\u6bd4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u5316\u63a9\u7801\u4f5c\u4e3aLLM RL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u53ef\u63a7\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "VAM\u5728LLM RL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Yet, their reliability is increasingly questioned due to sensitivity to shallow variations in input prompts. This paper examines how controlled, truth-conditionally equivalent lexical and syntactic perturbations affect the absolute performance and relative ranking of 23 contemporary LLMs across three benchmarks: MMLU, SQuAD, and AMEGA. We employ two linguistically principled pipelines to generate meaning-preserving variations: one performing synonym substitution for lexical changes, and another using dependency parsing to determine applicable syntactic transformations. Results show that lexical perturbations consistently induce substantial, statistically significant performance degradation across nearly all models and tasks, while syntactic perturbations have more heterogeneous effects, occasionally improving results.

However, endoscopic scenes violate the rigidity assumption due to persistent soft-tissue deformations, creating a strong coupling ambiguity between camera ego-motion and intrinsic deformation. Although recent monocular non-rigid SLAM methods have made notable progress, they often lack effective decoupling mechanisms and rely on sparse or low-fidelity scene representations, which leads to tracking drift and limited reconstruction quality. To address these limitations, we propose NRGS-SLAM, a monocular non-rigid SLAM system for endoscopy based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. To resolve the coupling ambiguity, we introduce a deformation-aware 3D Gaussian map that augments each Gaussian primitive with a learnable deformation probability, optimized via a Bayesian self-supervision strategy without requiring external non-rigidity labels. Building on this representation, we design a deformable tracking module that performs robust coarse-to-fine pose estimation by prioritizing low-deformation regions, followed by efficient per-frame deformation updates. A carefully designed deformable mapping module progressively expands and refines the map, balancing representational capacity and computational efficiency. In addition, a unified robust geometric loss incorporates external geometric priors to mitigate the inherent ill-posedness of monocular non-rigid SLAM. Extensive experiments on multiple public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that NRGS-SLAM achieves more accurate camera pose estimation (up to 50\\% reduction in RMSE) and higher-quality photo-realistic reconstructions than state-of-the-art methods. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our key design choices.

Experiments on three models, including Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, on six widely used challenging mathematical benchmarks show consistent gains: our method achieves +19.3% improvement over LoRA-based fine-tuning and +29.9% over LRMs without fine-tuning on average, with up to +23.4 accuracy improvement on AIME2024/2025 under the same tight cache budgets. These results demonstrate that Progressive Thought Encoding not only improves reasoning accuracy but also makes RL training of LRMs substantially more efficient and scalable under real-world memory constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u7f16\u7801\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u52a0\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u969c\u788d\uff1a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u8981\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u56de\u6eda\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u9650\u5236\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u9010\u6b65\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9a\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5b8c\u6574\u7f13\u5b58\u56de\u6eda\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u9700\u8981\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u5185\u5b58\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5305\u62ecQwen2.5-3B-Instruct\u3001Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct\u548cDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B\uff0c\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86+19.3%\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8eLoRA\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86+29.9%\uff0c\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86+29.9%\u3002\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u7d27\u7f29\u7f13\u5b58\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0cAIME2024/2025\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86+23.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u7f16\u7801\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u52a0\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose Phantom, an automated agent hijacking framework built upon Structured Template Injection that targets the fundamental architectural mechanisms of LLM agents. Our key insight is that agents rely on specific chat template tokens to separate system, user, assistant, and tool instructions.

The availability heuristic, proposed by A. Tversky and D. Kahneman in 1973, suggests that the ease with which relevant instances come to mind, typically operationalised by the mere frequency of exposure, can offer a mental shortcut for problems in which the test-taker does not know the exact answer. Is simply choosing the option that comes most readily to mind a good strategy for answering MCQs? We propose a computational method of assessing the cognitive availability of MCQ options operationalised by concepts' prevalence in large corpora. The key finding, across three large question sets, is that correct answers, independently of the question stem, are significantly more available than incorrect MCQ options. Specifically, using Wikipedia as the retrieval corpus, we find that always selecting the most available option leads to scores 13.5% to 32.9% above the random-guess baseline. We further find that LLM-generated MCQ options show similar patterns of availability compared to expert-created options, despite the LLMs' frequentist nature and their training on large collections of textual data.

Although token pruning has proven effective for accelerating inference, determining when and where to prune remains largely heuristic. Existing approaches typically rely on static, empirically selected layers, which limit interpretability and transferability across models. In this work, we introduce a matrix-entropy perspective and identify an \"Entropy Collapse Layer\" (ECL), where the information content of visual representations exhibits a sharp and consistent drop, which provides a principled criterion for selecting the pruning stage. Building on this observation, we propose EntropyPrune, a novel matrix-entropy-guided token pruning framework that quantifies the information value of individual visual tokens and prunes redundant ones without relying on attention maps. Moreover, to enable efficient computation, we exploit the spectral equivalence of dual Gram matrices, reducing the complexity of entropy computation and yielding up to a 64x theoretical speedup. Extensive experiments on diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that EntropyPrune consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in both accuracy and efficiency.

An Exact Analysis for the Data-driven Newsvendor", "comment": null, "summary": "We study the offline data-driven newsvendor problem with censored demand data. In contrast to prior works where demand is fully observed, we consider the setting where demand is censored at the inventory level and only sales are observed; sales match demand when there is sufficient inventory, and equal the available inventory otherwise. We provide a general procedure to compute the exact worst-case regret of classical data-driven inventory policies, evaluated over all demand distributions. Our main technical result shows that this infinite-dimensional, non-convex optimization problem can be reduced to a finite-dimensional one, enabling an exact characterization of the performance of policies for any sample size and censoring levels. We leverage this reduction to derive sharp insights on the achievable performance of standard inventory policies under demand censoring. In particular, our analysis of the Kaplan-Meier policy shows that while demand censoring fundamentally limits what can be learned from passive sales data, just a small amount of targeted exploration at high inventory levels can substantially improve worst-case guarantees, enabling near-optimal performance even under heavy censoring. In contrast, when the point-of-sale system does not record stockout events and only reports realized sales, a natural and commonly used approach is to treat sales as demand. Our results show that policies based on this sales-as-demand heuristic can suffer severe performance degradation as censored data accumulates, highlighting how the quality of point-of-sale information critically shapes what can, and cannot, be learned offline.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In practice, this split can break under real constraints. The prediction model may look good, but the final decision can be unstable when the market shifts, when discrete constraints are added (lot sizes, caps), or when the optimization becomes slow for larger asset sets. Also, regulated settings need a clear audit trail that links each decision to the exact model state and inputs. We present HQFS, a practical hybrid pipeline that connects forecasting, discrete risk optimization, and auditability in one flow. First, HQFS learns next-step return and a volatility proxy using a variational quantum circuit (VQC) with a small classical head. Second, HQFS converts the risk-return objective and constraints into a QUBO and solves it with quantum annealing when available, while keeping a compatible classical QUBO solver as a fallback for deployment. Third, HQFS signs each rebalance output using a post-quantum signature so the allocation can be verified later without trusting the runtime environment. On our market dataset study, HQFS reduces return prediction error by 7.8% and volatility prediction error by 6.1% versus a tuned classical baseline. For the decision layer, HQFS improves out-of-sample Sharpe by 9.4% and lowers maximum drawdown by 11.7%. The QUBO solve stage also cuts average solve time by 28% compared to a mixed-integer baseline under the same constraints, while producing fully traceable, signed allocation records.", "AI": {"tldr": "HQFS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u91d1\u878d\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u98ce\u9669\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4f18\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u76d1\u7ba1\u73af\u5883\u9700\u8981\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHQFS\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u79bb\u6563\u98ce\u9669\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aQUBO\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u7ecf\u5178QUBO\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5907\u7528\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u540e\u91cf\u5b50\u7b7e\u540d\u5bf9\u518d\u5e73\u8861\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u7b7e\u540d\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e02\u573a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cHQFS\u5c06\u56de\u62a5\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u4e867.8%\uff0c\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u4e866.1%\u3002\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u5c42\uff0cHQFS\u5c06\u6837\u672c\u5916\u590f\u666e\u6bd4\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e869.4%\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u56de\u64a4\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8611.7%\u3002\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cQUBO\u6c42\u89e3\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u6c42\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8628%\u3002", "conclusion": "HQFS\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u98ce\u9669\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e86\u76d1\u7ba1\u8981\u6c42\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a revised CDCR annotation scheme of the NewsWCL50 dataset, treating coreference chains as discourse elements (DEs) and conceptual units of analysis. The approach accommodates both identity and near-identity relations, e.g., by linking \"the caravan\" - \"asylum seekers\" - \"those contemplating illegal entry\", allowing models to capture lexical diversity and framing variation in media discourse, while maintaining the fine-grained annotation of DEs. We reannotate the NewsWCL50 and a subset of ECB+ using a unified codebook and evaluate the new datasets through lexical diversity metrics and a same-head-lemma baseline.

While existing approaches encode refusal behaviors across multiple latent features, suppressing a single dominant feature$-$via prompt-based jailbreaks$-$can cause alignment to collapse, leading to unsafe generation. Motivated by this, we propose fail-closed alignment as a design principle for robust LLM safety: refusal mechanisms should remain effective even under partial failures via redundant, independent causal pathways. We present a concrete instantiation of this principle: a progressive alignment framework that iteratively identifies and ablates previously learned refusal directions, forcing the model to reconstruct safety along new, independent subspaces. Across four jailbreak attacks, we achieve the strongest overall robustness while mitigating over-refusal and preserving generation quality, with small computational overhead. Our mechanistic analyses confirm that models trained with our method encode multiple, causally independent refusal directions that prompt-based jailbreaks cannot suppress simultaneously, providing empirical support for fail-closed alignment as a principled foundation for robust LLM safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fafail-closed alignment\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8LLM\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u5373\u73b0\u4ee3\u62d2\u7edd\u673a\u5236\u662f\u5931\u6548\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fafail-closed alignment\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a33\u5065LLM\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff1a\u62d2\u7edd\u673a\u5236\u5e94\u8be5\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u6545\u969c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u56e0\u679c\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8fed\u4ee3\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u5148\u524d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u8feb\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65b0\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u8f7b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62d2\u7edd\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5c0f\u3002\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u56e0\u679c\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u538b\u5236\uff0c\u4e3afail-closed alignment\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a33\u5065LLM\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u652f\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fafail-closed alignment\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a33\u5065LLM\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

With a lot of hype and industrial demand in this field, it is not always clear how much progress there really is. To advance TS forecasting and analysis to the next level, here we argue that the field needs a dynamical systems (DS) perspective. TS of observations from natural or engineered systems almost always originate from some underlying DS, and arguably access to its governing equations would yield theoretically optimal forecasts. This is the promise of DS reconstruction (DSR), a class of ML/AI approaches that aim to infer surrogate models of the underlying DS from data. But models based on DS principles offer other profound advantages: Beyond short-term forecasts, they enable to predict the long-term statistics of an observed system, which in many practical scenarios may be the more relevant quantities. DS theory furthermore provides domain-independent theoretical insight into mechanisms underlying TS generation, and thereby will inform us, e.g., about upper bounds on performance of any TS model, generalization into unseen regimes as in tipping points, or potential control strategies. After reviewing some of the central concepts, methods, measures, and models in DS theory and DSR, we will discuss how insights from this field can advance TS modeling in crucial ways, enabling better forecasting with much lower computational and memory footprints.

Crucially, Conv-FinRe provides multi-view references that distinguish descriptive behavior from normative utility grounded in investor-specific risk preferences, enabling diagnosis of whether an LLM follows rational analysis, mimics user noise, or is driven by market momentum. We build the benchmark from real market data and human decision trajectories, instantiate controlled advisory conversations, and evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs. Results reveal a persistent tension between rational decision quality and behavioral alignment: models that perform well on utility-based ranking often fail to match user choices, whereas behaviorally aligned models can overfit short-term noise.

We formalize several families of consistency-based black-box scorers, providing generalizations and extensions of existing methods. In our experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets, we find 1) claim-response entailment consistently performs better or on par with more complex claim-level scorers, 2) claim-level scoring generally yields better results than sentence-level scoring, and 3) uncertainty-aware decoding is highly effective for improving the factuality of long-form outputs.

We present UniLeak, a mechanistic-interpretability framework that identifies universal activation directions: latent directions in a model's residual stream whose linear addition at inference time consistently increases the likelihood of generating PII across prompts. These model-specific directions generalize across contexts and amplify PII generation probability, with minimal impact on generation quality. UniLeak recovers such directions without access to training data or groundtruth PII, relying only on self-generated text. Across multiple models and datasets, steering along these universal directions substantially increases PII leakage compared to existing prompt-based extraction methods.

We introduce AIDG (Adversarial Information Deduction Game), a game-theoretic framework that probes the asymmetry between information extraction (active deduction) and information containment (state maintenance) in dialogue. We propose two complementary tasks: AIDG-I, measuring pragmatic strategy in social deduction, and AIDG-II, measuring constraint satisfaction in a structured \"20 Questions\" setting. Across 439 games with six frontier LLMs, we observe a clear capability asymmetry: models perform substantially better at containment than deduction, with a 350 ELO advantage on defense;(Cohen's d = 5.47). We identify two bottlenecks driving this gap: (1) Information Dynamics, where confirmation strategies are 7.75x more effective than blind deduction (p < 0.00001), and (2) Constraint Adherence, where instruction-following degrades under conversational load, accounting for 41.3% of deductive failures. These findings suggest that while LLMs excel at local defensive coherence, they struggle with the global state tracking required for strategic inquiry.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Accurate and timely perception of vehicle type, position, and speed is essential for enabling effective priority control strategies. This paper presents the design, deployment, and evaluation of an infrastructure-based multi-modal freight vehicle detection system integrating LiDAR and camera sensors. A hybrid sensing architecture is adopted, consisting of an intersection-mounted subsystem and a midblock subsystem, connected via wireless communication for synchronized data transmission. The perception pipeline incorporates both clustering-based and deep learning-based detection methods with Kalman filter tracking to achieve stable real-time performance. LiDAR measurements are registered into geodetic reference frames to support lane-level localization and consistent vehicle tracking. Field evaluations demonstrate that the system can reliably monitor freight vehicle movements at high spatio-temporal resolution.

Observational study with a predictive modeling approach using a cross-sectional design, aimed at estimating the chances of developing dementia, using data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), involving 9,412 participants. Dementia was determined based on neuropsychological assessment and informant-based cognitive function. Analyses were performed using Random Forest (RF) and multivariable logistic regression to estimate the risk of dementia in the middle-aged and elderly populations of Brazil. The prevalence of dementia was 9.6%. The highest odds of dementia were observed in illiterate individuals (Odds Ratio (OR) = 7.42), individuals aged 90 years or older (OR = 11.00), low weight (OR = 2.11), low handgrip strength (OR = 2.50), self-reported black skin color (OR = 1.47), physical inactivity (OR = 1.61), self-reported hearing loss (OR = 1.65), and presence of depressive symptoms (OR = 1.72). Higher education (OR=0.44), greater life satisfaction (OR=0.72), and being employed (OR=0.78) were protective factors.

However, creating fair matches between lobbies (pre-made teams) of heterogeneous skill levels presents a significant challenge. Matching based simply on average team skill metrics, such as mean or median rating or rank, often results in unbalanced and one-sided games, particularly when skill distributions are wide or skewed. This paper introduces Cinder, a two-stage matchmaking system designed to provide fast and fair matches. Cinder first employs a rapid preliminary filter by comparing the \"non-outlier\" skill range of lobbies using the Ruzicka similarity index. Lobbies that pass this initial check are then evaluated using a more precise fairness metric. This second stage involves mapping player ranks to a non-linear set of skill buckets, generated from an inverted normal distribution, to provide higher granularity at average skill levels. The fairness of a potential match is then quantified using the Kantorovich distance on the lobbies' sorted bucket indices, producing a \"Sanction Score.\" We demonstrate the system's viability by analyzing the distribution of Sanction Scores from 140 million simulated lobby pairings, providing a robust foundation for fair matchmaking thresholds.", "AI": {"tldr": "Cinder\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5339\u914d\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u591a\u4eba\u5728\u7ebf\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u4e14\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u5339\u914d\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u73a9\u5bb6\u7559\u5b58\u548c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6280\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u5339\u914d\u4e2d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCinder\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5339\u914d\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7Ruzicka\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6570\u6bd4\u8f83\u201c\u975e\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u201d\u6280\u80fd\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u6876\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6280\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\u7c92\u5ea6\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u4f7f\u7528Kantorovich\u8ddd\u79bb\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u5339\u914d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u67901.4\u4ebf\u4e2a\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u5339\u914d\u5bf9\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u5339\u914d\u9608\u503c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "Cinder\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u73a9\u5bb6\u7559\u5b58\u548c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

We propose a simple bias-reduced evaluation protocol that replaces the labels of each question with uniform, unordered labels and prompts the LLM to use the whole answer presented. With a simple sentence similarity model, we demonstrate improved robustness and lower standard deviation between different permutations of answers with a minimal drop in LLM's performance, exposing the LLM's capabilities under reduced evaluation artifacts, without any help from the prompt examples or the option labels. Across multiple benchmarks and models, this protocol substantially improves the robustness to answer permutations, reducing mean accuracy variance $3\\times$ with only a minimal decrease in the mean model's performance.

Scaling to textbooks and research papers is largely unaddressed, as it requires managing cross-file dependencies, resolving imports, and ensuring that entire projects compile end-to-end. We present M2F (Math-to-Formal), the first agentic framework for end-to-end, project-scale autoformalization in Lean. The framework operates in two stages. The statement compilation stage splits the document into atomic blocks, orders them via inferred dependencies, and repairs declaration skeletons until the project compiles, allowing placeholders in proofs. The proof repair stage closes these holes under fixed signatures using goal-conditioned local edits. Throughout both stages, M2F keeps the verifier in the loop, committing edits only when toolchain feedback confirms improvement. In approximately three weeks, M2F converts long-form mathematical sources into a project-scale Lean library of 153,853 lines from 479 pages textbooks on real analysis and convex analysis, fully formalized as Lean declarations with accompanying proofs. This represents textbook-scale formalization at a pace that would typically require months or years of expert effort. On FATE-H, we achieve $96\\%$ proof success (vs.\\ $80\\%$ for a strong baseline).

Data selection techniques can effectively reduce the amount of training data required for fine-tuning LMs. However, their effectiveness is closely related to computational resources, which always require a high compute budget. Owing to the resource limitations in practical fine-tuning scenario, we systematically reveal the relationship between data selection and uncertainty estimation of selected data. Although large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation, which provide new ways to alleviate data scarcity, evaluating data usability remains a challenging task. This makes efficient data selection indispensable. To mitigate these issues, we propose Entropy-Based Unsupervised Data Selection (EUDS) framework. Empirical experiments on sentiment analysis (SA), topic classification (Topic-CLS), and question answering (Q&A) tasks validate its effectiveness. EUDS establishes a computationally efficient data-filtering mechanism. Theoretical analysis and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach. EUDS significantly reduces computational costs and improves training time efficiency with less data requirement.

While self-explainable GNNs attempt to bridge this gap, they often rely on standard message-passing backbones that inherit fundamental limitations, including the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) expressivity barrier and a lack of fine-grained interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose SymGraph, a symbolic framework designed to transcend these constraints. By replacing continuous message passing with discrete structural hashing and topological role-based aggregation, our architecture theoretically surpasses the 1-WL barrier, achieving superior expressiveness without the overhead of differentiable optimization. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that SymGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing self-explainable GNNs.

Due to their complexity and prolonged duration, colorectal procedures have been underrepresented in current research. At the same time, they pose a particularly interesting learning environment due to repetitive tissue manipulation, making them a promising entry point for autonomous, machine learning-driven support. Therefore, in this work, we introduce attachment anchors, a structured representation that encodes the local geometric and mechanical relationships between tissue and its anatomical attachments in colorectal surgery. This representation reduces uncertainty in grasping point prediction by normalizing surgical scenes into a consistent local reference frame. We demonstrate that attachment anchors can be predicted from laparoscopic images and incorporated into a grasping framework based on machine learning. Experiments on a dataset of 90 colorectal surgeries demonstrate that attachment anchors improve grasping point prediction compared to image-only baselines. There are particularly strong gains in out-of-distribution settings, including unseen procedures and operating surgeons. These results suggest that attachment anchors are an effective intermediate representation for learning-based tissue manipulation in colorectal surgery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9644\u4ef6\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u764c\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u6293\u53d6\u70b9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5fae\u521b\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u64cd\u4f5c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u50cf\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u764c\u5e72\u9884\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u590d\u6742\u548c\u53ef\u53d8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\uff0c\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u764c\u624b\u672f\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u4f53\u73b0\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u522b\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b83\u4eec\u6210\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u652f\u6301\u7684\u5207\u5165\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u9644\u4ef6\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u764c\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e0e\u5176\u89e3\u5256\u9644\u7740\u7269\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u673a\u68b0\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8868\u793a\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u5230\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u672c\u5730\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u6293\u53d6\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8179\u8154\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u6d4b\u9644\u4ef6\u951a\u70b9\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u7eb3\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u572890\u4f8b\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u764c\u624b\u672f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u9644\u4ef6\u951a\u70b9\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6293\u53d6\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u548c\u624b\u672f\u533b\u751f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u7279\u522b\u5f3a\u52b2\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9644\u4ef6\u951a\u70b9\u662f\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u764c\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9644\u4ef6\u951a\u70b9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u764c\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

However, existing RL methods normally use a \\emph{single} policy network, causing \\emph{simplicity bias} where simple tasks occupy most parameters and dominate gradient updates, leaving insufficient capacity for complex tasks. A plausible remedy could be employing the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in the policy network, as MoE allows different parameters (experts) to specialize in different tasks, preventing simple tasks from dominating all parameters. However, a key limitation of traditional MoE is its token-level routing, where the router assigns each token to specialized experts, which fragments phase-consistent patterns into scattered expert assignments and thus undermines expert specialization. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{Phase-Aware Mixture of Experts (PA-MoE)}. It first features a lightweight \\emph{phase router} that learns latent phase boundaries directly from the RL objective without pre-defining phase categories.

Medical image registration is dominated by intensity-based registration methods that rely on surrogate measures of alignment quality. In contrast, feature-based approaches that operate by identifying explicit anatomical correspondences, while more desirable in theory, have largely fallen out of favor due to the challenges of reliably extracting features. However, such challenges are now significantly overcome thanks to recent advances in deep learning, which provide pre-trained segmentation models capable of instantly delivering reliable, fine-grained anatomical delineations. We aim to demonstrate that these advances can be leveraged to create new anatomically-grounded image registration algorithms. To this end, we propose Polaffini, which obtains, from these segmented regions, anatomically grounded feature points with 1-to-1 correspondence in a particularly simple way: extracting their centroids. These enable efficient global and local affine matching via closed-form solutions. Those are used to produce an overall transformation ranging from affine to polyaffine with tunable smoothness. Polyaffine transformations can have many more degrees of freedom than affine ones allowing for finer alignment, and their embedding in the log-Euclidean framework ensures diffeomorphic properties.

A common solution is to exploit locality, which hinges on an Exponential Decay Property (EDP) of the value function. However, existing conditions that guarantee the EDP are often conservative, as they are based on worst-case, environment-only bounds (e.g., supremums over actions) and fail to capture the regularizing effect of the policy itself. In this work, we establish that locality can also be a \\emph{policy-dependent} phenomenon. Our central contribution is a novel decomposition of the policy-induced interdependence matrix, $H^\u03c0$, which decouples the environment's sensitivity to state ($E^{\\mathrm{s}}$) and action ($E^{\\mathrm{a}}$) from the policy's sensitivity to state ($\u03a0(\u03c0)$). This decomposition reveals that locality can be induced by a smooth policy (small $\u03a0(\u03c0)$) even when the environment is strongly action-coupled, exposing a fundamental locality-optimality tradeoff. We use this framework to derive a general spectral condition $\u03c1(E^{\\mathrm{s}}+E^{\\mathrm{a}}\u03a0(\u03c0)) < 1$ for exponential decay, which is strictly tighter than prior norm-based conditions. Finally, we leverage this theory to analyze a provably-sound localized block-coordinate policy improvement framework with guarantees tied directly to this spectral radius.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce a formal framework for reasoning faithfulness, defined by two testable conditions: stance consistency (a coherent stance linking reasoning to answer) and causal influence (the stated reasoning causally drives the answer under output-level interventions), explicitly decoupled from accuracy. To operationalize this, we present RFEval, a benchmark of 7,186 instances across seven tasks that probes faithfulness via controlled, output-level counterfactual interventions. Evaluating twelve open-source LRMs, we find unfaithfulness in 49.7% of outputs, predominantly from stance inconsistency. Failures are concentrated in brittle, convergent domains such as math and code, and correlate more with post-training regimes than with scale: within-family ablations indicate that adding current RL-style objectives on top of supervised fine-tuning can reduce reasoning faithfulness, even when accuracy is maintained. Crucially, accuracy is neither a sufficient nor a reliable proxy for faithfulness: once controlling for model and task, the accuracy-faithfulness link is weak and statistically insignificant. Our work establishes a rigorous methodology for auditing LRM reliability and shows that trustworthy AI requires optimizing not only for correct outcomes but also for the structural integrity of the reasoning process.

However, KC-level correctness labels are rarely available in real-world datasets, especially for open-ended programming tasks where solutions typically involve multiple KCs simultaneously. Simply propagating problem-level correctness to all associated KCs obscures partial mastery and often leads to poorly fitted learning curves. To address this challenge, we propose an automated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to label KC-level correctness directly from student-written code. Our method assesses whether each KC is correctly applied and further introduces a temporal context-aware Code-KC mapping mechanism to better align KCs with individual student code. We evaluate the resulting KC-level correctness labels in terms of learning curve fit and predictive performance using the power law of practice and the Additive Factors Model. Experimental results show that our framework leads to learning curves that are more consistent with cognitive theory and improves predictive performance, compared to baselines. Human evaluation further demonstrates substantial agreement between LLM and expert annotations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528LLMs\u6807\u8bb0\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u62df\u5408\u5ea6\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b66\u751f\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6280\u80fd\u8868\u793a\uff08\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff09\u662f\u57fa\u672c\u8981\u7d20\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f88\u5c11\u63d0\u4f9b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u7f16\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u6240\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4f1a\u63a9\u76d6\u90e8\u5206\u638c\u63e1\uff0c\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u66f2\u7ebf\u62df\u5408\u4e0d\u826f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u5b66\u751f\u7f16\u5199\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6807\u8bb0\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u662f\u5426\u88ab\u6b63\u786e\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4ee3\u7801-\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6620\u5c04\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4e0e\u4e2a\u522b\u5b66\u751f\u4ee3\u7801\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLM\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6ce8\u91ca\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528LLMs\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u5b66\u751f\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6807\u8bb0\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u62df\u5408\u5ea6\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

We introduce DRetHTR, a decoder-only model built on Retentive Networks (RetNet). Compared to an equally sized decoder-only Transformer baseline, DRetHTR delivers 1.6-1.9x faster inference with 38-42% less memory usage, without loss of accuracy. By replacing softmax attention with softmax-free retention and injecting multi-scale sequential priors, DRetHTR avoids a growing KV cache: decoding is linear in output length in both time and memory. To recover the local-to-global inductive bias of attention, we propose layer-wise gamma scaling, which progressively enlarges the effective retention horizon in deeper layers. This encourages early layers to model short-range dependencies and later layers to capture broader context, mitigating the flexibility gap introduced by removing softmax. Consequently, DRetHTR achieves best reported test character error rates of 2.26% (IAM-A, en), 1.81% (RIMES, fr), and 3.46% (Bentham, en), and is competitive on READ-2016 (de) with 4.21%.

We introduce a training framework that adapts regularization in response to safety risk, enabling models to remain aligned throughout fine-tuning. To estimate safety risk at training time, we explore two distinct approaches: a judge-based Safety Critic that assigns high-level harm scores to training batches, and an activation-based risk predictor built with a lightweight classifier trained on intermediate model activations to estimate harmful intent. Each approach provides a risk signal that is used to constrain updates deemed higher risk to remain close to a safe reference policy, while lower-risk updates proceed with standard training. We empirically verify that harmful intent signals are predictable from pre-generation activations and that judge scores provide effective high-recall safety guidance. Across multiple model families and attack scenarios, adaptive regularization with either risk estimation approach consistently lowers attack success rate compared to standard fine-tuning, preserves downstream performance, and adds no inference-time cost. This work demonstrates a principled mechanism for maintaining safety without sacrificing utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Code available at https://github.com/miccunifi/SpectralGCD", "summary": "Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify novel categories in unlabeled data while leveraging a small labeled subset of known classes. Training a parametric classifier solely on image features often leads to overfitting to old classes, and recent multimodal approaches improve performance by incorporating textual information. However, they treat modalities independently and incur high computational cost. We propose SpectralGCD, an efficient and effective multimodal approach to GCD that uses CLIP cross-modal image-concept similarities as a unified cross-modal representation. Each image is expressed as a mixture over semantic concepts from a large task-agnostic dictionary, which anchors learning to explicit semantics and reduces reliance on spurious visual cues. To maintain the semantic quality of representations learned by an efficient student, we introduce Spectral Filtering which exploits a cross-modal covariance matrix over the softmaxed similarities measured by a strong teacher model to automatically retain only relevant concepts from the dictionary. Forward and reverse knowledge distillation from the same teacher ensures that the cross-modal representations of the student remain both semantically sufficient and well-aligned. Across six benchmarks, SpectralGCD delivers accuracy comparable to or significantly superior to state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the computational cost.

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can potentially generate fine-grained, language-based analyses, yet existing methods often require costly fine-tuning and do not consistently improve anomaly detection accuracy compared to lightweight specialist detectors. We propose expert-augmented attention guidance for industrial anomaly detection in MLLMs (EAGLE), a tuning-free framework that integrates outputs from expert model to guide MLLMs toward both accurate detection and interpretable anomaly descriptions. We further study how EAGLE affects MLLMs internals by examining the attention distribution of MLLMs to the anomalous image regions in the intermediate layers. We observe that successful anomaly detection is associated with increased attention concentration on anomalous regions, and EAGLE tends to encourage this alignment. Experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA show that EAGLE improves anomaly detection performance across multiple MLLMs without any parameter updates, achieving results comparable to fine-tuning based methods.

These findings demonstrate that cultural competence requires more than scaling monolingual data, as current models learn to mimic cultural patterns without internalizing the underlying schemas.", "AI": {"tldr": "DivanBench\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6ce2\u65afLLMs\u5728\u6587\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6ce2\u65afNLP\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u8bed\u7528\u5b66\u548c\u793c\u8c8c\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6240\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5f88\u5c11\u533a\u5206\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u5316\u4e8b\u5b9e\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9690\u542b\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165DivanBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8ff7\u4fe1\u548c\u4e60\u4fd7\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e60\u4fd7\u662f\u4efb\u610f\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7b80\u5355\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u901a\u8fc7315\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e09\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u4e8b\u5b9e\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u6210\u5bf9\u573a\u666f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u63a8\u7406\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e03\u4e2a\u6ce2\u65afLLMs\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u987a\u4ece\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u62d2\u7edd\u660e\u663e\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6ce2\u65af\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u653e\u5927\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8fa8\u522b\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5728\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u8868\u73b0\u51fa21%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u4eff\u6587\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u6ca1\u6709\u5185\u5316\u5e95\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

Recent state-of-the-art methods based on implicit neural representations or 3D Gaussian splatting have made notable progress. However, most are designed for deformable scenes with fixed endoscope viewpoints and rely on stereo depth priors or accurate structure-from-motion for initialization and optimization, limiting their ability to handle monocular sequences with large camera motion in real clinical settings. To address this, we propose Local-EndoGS, a high-quality 4D reconstruction framework for monocular endoscopic sequences with arbitrary camera motion. Local-EndoGS introduces a progressive, window-based global representation that allocates local deformable scene models to each observed window, enabling scalability to long sequences with substantial motion. To overcome unreliable initialization without stereo depth or accurate structure-from-motion, we design a coarse-to-fine strategy integrating multi-view geometry, cross-window information, and monocular depth priors, providing a robust foundation for optimization. We further incorporate long-range 2D pixel trajectory constraints and physical motion priors to improve deformation plausibility. Experiments on three public endoscopic datasets with deformable scenes and varying camera motions show that Local-EndoGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance quality and geometry. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our key designs.

In this paper, we propose Action Graph Policies (AGP), that model dependencies among agents' available action choices. It constructs, what we call, \\textit{coordination contexts}, that enable agents to condition their decisions on global action dependencies. Theoretically, we show that AGPs induce a strictly more expressive joint policy compared to fully independent policies and can realize coordinated joint actions that are provably more optimal than greedy execution even from centralized value-decomposition methods. Empirically, we show that AGP achieves 80-95\\% success on canonical coordination tasks with partial observability and anti-coordination penalties, where other MARL methods reach only 10-25\\%.

Under review", "summary": "Recent work has shown that language models (LMs) trained on synthetic corpora can exhibit typological preferences that resemble cross-linguistic regularities in human languages, particularly for syntactic phenomena such as word order. In this paper, we extend this paradigm to differential argument marking (DAM), a semantic licensing system in which morphological marking depends on semantic prominence. Using a controlled synthetic learning method, we train GPT-2 models on 18 corpora implementing distinct DAM systems and evaluate their generalization using minimal pairs. Our results reveal a dissociation between two typological dimensions of DAM. Models reliably exhibit human-like preferences for natural markedness direction, favoring systems in which overt marking targets semantically atypical arguments. In contrast, models do not reproduce the strong object preference in human languages, in which overt marking in DAM more often targets objects rather than subjects.

To address this, modern SHAP implementations now include the Owen value, a hierarchical generalization of the Shapley value that supports group attributions. While the Owen value preserves the foundations of Shapley values, its effectiveness critically depends on how feature groups are defined. We show that commonly used segmentations (e.g., axis-aligned or SLIC) violate key consistency properties, and propose a new segmentation approach that satisfies the $T$-property to ensure semantic alignment across hierarchy levels.

However, since the objective is defined relative to a group of sampled trajectories, extended deliberation can create more chances to realize relative gains, leading to inefficient reasoning and overthinking, and complicating the trade-off between correctness and rollout efficiency. Controlling this behavior is difficult in practice, considering (i) Length penalties are hard to calibrate because longer rollouts may reflect harder problems that require longer reasoning, penalizing tokens risks truncating useful reasoning along with redundant continuation; and (ii) supervision that directly indicates when to continue or stop is typically unavailable beyond final answer correctness. We propose Weakly Supervised GRPO (WS-GRPO), which improves rollout efficiency by converting terminal rewards into correctness-aware guidance over partial trajectories. Unlike global length penalties that are hard to calibrate, WS-GRPO trains a preference model from outcome-only correctness to produce prefix-level signals that indicate when additional continuation is beneficial.

Capturing these dependencies is critical for identifying students' knowledge gaps and enabling targeted intervention for personalized learning. This is especially challenging in large-scale courses, where instructors cannot feasibly diagnose individual misunderstanding or determine which concepts need reinforcement. While knowledge graphs offer a natural representation for capturing these conceptual relationships at scale, existing approaches are either surface-level (focusing on course-level concepts like \"Algorithms\" or logistical relationships such as course enrollment), or disregard the rich pedagogical signals embedded in instructional materials. We propose InstructKG, a framework for automatically constructing instructor-aligned knowledge graphs that capture a course's intended learning progression. Given a course's lecture materials (slides, notes, etc.), InstructKG extracts significant concepts as nodes and infers learning dependencies as directed edges (e.g., \"part-of\" or \"depends-on\" relationships). The framework synergizes the rich temporal and semantic signals unique to educational materials (e.g., \"recursion\" is taught before \"mergesort\"; \"recursion\" is mentioned in the definition of \"merge sort\") with the generalizability of large language models.

The application at hand is in the domain of behavioral neuroscience, studying fear generalization in mice, an important problem whose progress can advance our understanding of clinically significant and often debilitating conditions such as PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). We identify the emerging paradigm of \"In-Context Learning\" (ICL) as a suitable interface for domain experts to automate parts of their pipeline without the need for or familiarity with AI model training and fine-tuning, and showcase its remarkable efficacy in data preparation and pattern interpretation. Also, we introduce novel AI-enhancements to tensor decomposition model, which allows for more seamless pattern discovery from the heterogeneous data in our application. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed pipeline experimentally, showcasing its superior performance compared to what is standard practice in the domain, as well as against reasonable ML baselines that do not fall under the ICL paradigm, to ensure that we are not compromising performance in our quest for a seamless and easy-to-use interface for domain experts.

This paper argues that the missing account must begin with a paradigmatic break that has not yet received adequate philosophical attention. In the Turing-Shannon-von Neumann tradition, information enters the machine as encoded binary vectors, and semantics remains external to the process. Neural network architectures rupture this regime: symbolic input is instantly projected into a high-dimensional space where coordinates correspond to semantic parameters, transforming binary code into a position in a geometric space of meanings. It is this space that constitutes the active epistemic condition shaping generative production.

It is currently under review at IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)", "summary": "Detecting anomalies in time-series data is critical in domains such as industrial operations, finance, and cybersecurity, where early identification of abnormal patterns is essential for ensuring system reliability and enabling preventive maintenance. However, most existing methods are reactive: they detect anomalies only after they occur and lack the capability to provide proactive early warning signals. In this paper, we propose FATE (Forecasting Anomalies with Time-series Ensembles), a novel unsupervised framework for detecting Precursors-of-Anomaly (PoA) by quantifying predictive uncertainty from a diverse ensemble of time-series forecasting models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on reconstruction errors or require ground-truth labels, FATE anticipates future values and leverages ensemble disagreement to signal early signs of potential anomalies without access to target values at inference time. To rigorously evaluate PoA detection, we introduce Precursor Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (PTaPR), a new metric that extends the traditional Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (TaPR) by jointly assessing segment-level accuracy, within-segment coverage, and temporal promptness of early predictions. This enables a more holistic assessment of early warning capabilities that existing metrics overlook. Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets show that FATE achieves an average improvement of 19.9 percentage points in PTaPR AUC and 20.02 percentage points in early detection F1 score, outperforming baselines while requiring no anomaly labels. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of FATE for real-time unsupervised early warning in complex time-series environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "FATE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5f02\u5e38\u524d\u5146\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u68c0\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u5bf9\u4e8e\u786e\u4fdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u9632\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u662f\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u53d1\u751f\u540e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e3b\u52a8\u9884\u8b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFATE\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u6765\u81ea\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u524d\u5146\uff08PoA\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFATE\u5728PTaPR AUC\u65b9\u9762\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8619.9\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4bF1\u5206\u6570\u65b9\u9762\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8620.02\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5f02\u5e38\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "conclusion": "FATE\u5bf9\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u662f\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u3002"}}

However, such relationships are often implicit and costly to annotate manually. While existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often infer event relations through dense captions or video summaries for video reasoning, such modeling still lacks causal understanding. Without explicit causal structure modeling within and across video events, these models suffer from hallucinations during the video reasoning. In this work, we propose GraphThinker, a reinforcement finetuning-based method that constructs structural event-level scene graphs and enhances visual grounding to jointly reduce hallucinations in video reasoning. Specifically, we first employ an MLLM to construct an event-based video scene graph (EVSG) that explicitly models both intra- and inter-event relations, and incorporate these formed scene graphs into the MLLM as an intermediate thinking process. We also introduce a visual attention reward during reinforcement finetuning, which strengthens video grounding and further mitigates hallucinations.

However, as the volume of unique IDs expands, traditional hash-based indexing methods suffer from collisions that degrade model performance and personalization quality. We present Multi-Probe Zero Collision Hash (MPZCH), a novel indexing mechanism based on linear probing that effectively mitigates embedding collisions. With reasonable table sizing, it often eliminates these collisions entirely while maintaining production-scale efficiency. MPZCH utilizes auxiliary tensors and high-performance CUDA kernels to implement configurable probing and active eviction policies. By retiring obsolete IDs and resetting reassigned slots, MPZCH prevents the stale embedding inheritance typical of hash-based methods, ensuring new features learn effectively from scratch. Despite its collision-mitigation overhead, the system maintains training QPS and inference latency comparable to existing methods. Rigorous online experiments demonstrate that MPZCH achieves zero collisions for user embeddings and significantly improves item embedding freshness and quality.

Across Transformers, CNNs, and MLPs, learned sign matrices resist low-rank approximation and are spectrally indistinguishable from an i.i.d. Rademacher baseline. Despite this apparent randomness, most weights retain their initialization signs; flips primarily occur via rare near-zero boundary crossings, suggesting that sign-pattern randomness is largely inherited from initialization. We formalize this behavior with sign lock-in theory, a stopping-time analysis of sign flips under SGD noise. Under bounded updates and a rare re-entry condition into a small neighborhood around zero, the number of effective sign flips exhibits a geometric tail.

We introduce JEPA-DNA, a novel pre-training framework that integrates the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) with traditional generative objectives. JEPA-DNA introduces latent grounding by coupling token-level recovery with a predictive objective in the latent space by supervising a CLS token. This forces the model to predict the high-level functional embeddings of masked genomic segments rather than focusing solely on individual nucleotides. JEPA-DNA extends both NTP and MLM paradigms and can be deployed either as a standalone from-scratch objective or as a continual pre-training enhancement for existing GFMs. Our evaluations across a diverse suite of genomic benchmarks demonstrate that JEPA-DNA consistently yields superior performance in supervised and zero-shot tasks compared to generative-only baselines.

However, existing image-conditioned systems suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) they are typically trained on natural photographs, limiting their ability to capture the richer semantic, stylistic, and cultural content of artworks; and (ii) most rely on an image-to-text conversion stage, using language as a semantic shortcut that simplifies conditioning but prevents direct visual-to-audio learning. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce ArtSound, a large-scale multimodal dataset of 105,884 artwork-music pairs enriched with dual-modality captions, obtained by extending ArtGraph and the Free Music Archive. We further propose ArtToMus, the first framework explicitly designed for direct artwork-to-music generation, which maps digitized artworks to music without image-to-text translation or language-based semantic supervision. The framework projects visual embeddings into the conditioning space of a latent diffusion model, enabling music synthesis guided solely by visual information. Experimental results show that ArtToMus generates musically coherent and stylistically consistent outputs that reflect salient visual cues of the source artworks.

These methods do not explicitly enforce person-garment alignment and fail to explain how correspondence emerges within Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). In this paper, we first analyze full 3D attention in DiT-based architecture and reveal that the person-garment correspondence critically depends on precise person-garment query-key matching within the full 3D attention. Building on this insight, we then introduce CORrespondence ALignment (CORAL), a DiT-based framework that explicitly aligns query-key matching with robust external correspondences. CORAL integrates two complementary components: a correspondence distillation loss that aligns reliable matches with person-garment attention, and an entropy minimization loss that sharpens the attention distribution.

We propose a new optimizer and a diagonal extension, NAMO and NAMO-D, providing the first principled integration of orthogonalized momentum with norm-based Adam-type noise adaptation. NAMO scales orthogonalized momentum using a single adaptive stepsize, preserving orthogonality while improving upon Muon at negligible additional cost. NAMO-D instead right-multiplies orthogonalized momentum by a diagonal matrix with clamped entries. This design enables neuron-wise noise adaptation and aligns with the common near block-diagonal Hessian structure. Under standard assumptions, we establish optimal convergence rates for both algorithms in the deterministic setting and show that, in the stochastic setting, their convergence guarantees adapt to the noise level of stochastic gradients.

However, existing unlearning approaches commonly suffer from a fundamental trade-off: aggressively erasing the influence of target data often degrades model utility on retained data, while conservative strategies leave residual target information intact. In this work, the intrinsic representation properties learned during model pretraining are analyzed. It is demonstrated that semantic class concepts are entangled at the feature-pattern level, sharing associated features while preserving concept-specific discriminative components. This entanglement fundamentally limits the effectiveness of existing unlearning paradigms. Motivated by this insight, we propose Machine-Guided Unlearning (MeGU), a novel framework that guides unlearning through concept-aware re-alignment. Specifically, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are leveraged to explicitly determine re-alignment directions for target samples by assigning semantically meaningful perturbing labels. To improve efficiency, inter-class conceptual similarities estimated by the MLLM are encoded into a lightweight transition matrix. Furthermore, MeGU introduces a positive-negative feature noise pair to explicitly disentangle target concept influence.

While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning, they often struggle to generate consistent, individual-specific behavior, particularly when accurate prediction depends on complex interactions between psychological traits and situational constraints. Prompting-based approaches can be brittle in this setting, exhibiting identity drift and limited ability to leverage increasingly detailed persona descriptions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Large Behavioral Model (LBM), a behavioral foundation model fine-tuned to predict individual strategic choices with high fidelity. LBM shifts from transient persona prompting to behavioral embedding by conditioning on a structured, high-dimensional trait profile derived from a comprehensive psychometric battery. Trained on a proprietary dataset linking stable dispositions, motivational states, and situational constraints to observed choices, LBM learns to map rich psychological profiles to discrete actions across diverse strategic dilemmas. In a held-out scenario evaluation, LBM fine-tuning improves behavioral prediction relative to the unadapted Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone and performs comparably to frontier baselines when conditioned on Big Five traits. Moreover, we find that while prompting-based baselines exhibit a complexity ceiling, LBM continues to benefit from increasingly dense trait profiles, with performance improving as additional trait dimensions are provided. Together, these results establish LBM as a scalable approach for high-fidelity behavioral simulation, enabling applications in strategic foresight, negotiation analysis, cognitive security, and decision support.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Compared to other types of generative AI models, such as GANs and VAEs, the sampling speed is known as a key disadvantage of diffusion models. By systematically comparing transport-based generative models on a numerical example of 2D Kolmogorov flows, we show that flow matching in a lower-dimensional latent space is suited for fast sampling of stochastic closure models, enabling single-step sampling that is up to two orders of magnitude faster than iterative diffusion-based approaches. To control the latent space distortion and thus ensure the physical fidelity of the sampled closure term, we compare the implicit regularization offered by a joint training scheme against two explicit regularizers: metric-preserving (MP) and geometry-aware (GA) constraints.

When presented with instructions that lack strong scene-specific supervision, VLAs suffer from counterfactual failures: they act based on vision shortcuts induced by dataset biases, repeatedly executing well-learned behaviors and selecting objects frequently seen during training regardless of language intent. To systematically study it, we introduce LIBERO-CF, the first counterfactual benchmark for VLAs that evaluates language following capability by assigning alternative instructions under visually plausible LIBERO layouts. Our evaluation reveals that counterfactual failures are prevalent yet underexplored across state-of-the-art VLAs. We propose Counterfactual Action Guidance (CAG), a simple yet effective dual-branch inference scheme that explicitly regularizes language conditioning in VLAs. CAG combines a standard VLA policy with a language-unconditioned Vision-Action (VA) module, enabling counterfactual comparison during action selection. This design reduces reliance on visual shortcuts, improves robustness on under-observed tasks, and requires neither additional demonstrations nor modifications to existing architectures or pretrained models. Extensive experiments demonstrate its plug-and-play integration across diverse VLAs and consistent improvements. For example, on LIBERO-CF, CAG improves $\u03c0_{0.5}$ by 9.7% in language following accuracy and 3.6% in task success on under-observed tasks using a training-free strategy, with further gains of 15.5% and 8.5%, respectively, when paired with a VA model. In real-world evaluations, CAG reduces counterfactual failures of 9.4% and improves task success by 17.2% on average.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce a claim-level framework for detecting and quantifying this \\emph{temporal knowledge leakage}.

Federated learning (FL) further facilitates this process by enabling collaborative fine-tuning across distributed clients without sharing private data. However, the use of two separate low-rank matrices in LoRA for federated fine-tuning introduces two types of challenges. The first challenge arises from the error induced by separately aggregating those two low-rank matrices. The second challenge occurs even when the product of two low-rank matrices is aggregated. The server needs to recover factors via matrix decomposition, which is non-unique and can introduce decomposition drift. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose FLoRG, a federated fine-tuning framework which employs a single low-rank matrix for fine-tuning and aggregates its Gram matrix (i.e., the matrix of inner products of its column vectors), eliminating the aggregation error while also reducing the communication overhead. FLoRG minimizes the decomposition drift by introducing a Procrustes alignment approach which aligns the decomposed matrix between consecutive fine-tuning rounds for consistent updates. We theoretically analyze the convergence of FLoRG and prove that adopting the Procrustes alignment results in a tighter convergence bound. Experimental results across multiple LLM fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FLoRG outperforms five state-of-the-art baseline schemes in the downstream task accuracy and can reduce the communication overhead by up to 2041$\\times$.", "AI": {"tldr": "FLoRG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e2a\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u548cGram\u77e9\u9635\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684LLM\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u964d\u4f4e", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6548\u7387", "method": "FLoRG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e2a\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u805a\u5408\u5176Gram\u77e9\u9635", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e94\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u9ad8\u8fbe2041\u500d", "conclusion": "FLoRG\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500"}}

The architecture is model-agnostic, supporting diverse inference patterns through standardized interfaces, enabling rapid adaptation without infrastructure overhead. We demonstrate practical applicability through an industrial implementation for Harmonized System (HS) code prediction, a compliance-critical task where short, unstructured product descriptions are mapped to standardized codes used by customs authorities in global trade. Frequent updates and ambiguous descriptions make classification challenging, with errors causing shipment delays and financial losses. Our solution uses a custom text embedding encoder and multiple deep learning architectures, with Text-CNN achieving 98 percent accuracy on ground truth data. Beyond accuracy, the pipeline ensures reproducibility, auditability, and SLA adherence under variable loads via auto-scaling. A key feature is automated A/B testing, enabling dynamic model selection and safe promotion in production. Cost-efficiency drives model choice; while transformers may achieve similar accuracy, their long-term operational costs are significantly higher. Deterministic classification with predictable latency and explainability is prioritized, though the architecture remains extensible to transformer variants and LLM-based inference.

Existing methods attempt to alleviate the dependence by, e.g., removing low-order moments from each individual sample. These solutions fail to capture the underlying time-evolving structure across samples and do not model the complex time structure. In this paper, we aim to address the distribution shift in the frequency space by considering all possible time structures. To this end, we propose a Time-Invariant Frequency Operator (TIFO), which learns stationarity-aware weights over the frequency spectrum across the entire dataset. The weight representation highlights stationary frequency components while suppressing non-stationary ones, thereby mitigating the distribution shift issue in time series. To justify our method, we show that the Fourier transform of time series data implicitly induces eigen-decomposition in the frequency space. TIFO is a plug-and-play approach that can be seamlessly integrated into various forecasting models. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves 18 top-1 and 6 top-2 results out of 28 forecasting settings. Notably, it yields 33.3% and 55.3% improvements in average MSE on the ETTm2 dataset.

While natural language search has seen dramatic progress in recent years largely driven by embedding-based models and large-scale pretraining, the field still faces significant challenges. Specifically, queries that involve complex relationships, object compositions, or precise constraints such as identities, counts and proportions often remain unresolved or unreliable within current frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates formal verification into deep learning-based image retrieval through a synergistic combination of graph-based verification methods and neural code generation. Our approach aims to support open-vocabulary natural language queries while producing results that are both trustworthy and verifiable. By grounding retrieval results in a system of formal reasoning, we move beyond the ambiguity and approximation that often characterize vector representations. Instead of accepting uncertainty as a given, our framework explicitly verifies each atomic truth in the user query against the retrieved content. This allows us to not only return matching results, but also to identify and mark which specific constraints are satisfied and which remain unmet, thereby offering a more transparent and accountable retrieval process while boosting the results of the most popular embedding-based approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u6570\u5b57\u4ea7\u4e1a\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f53\u524d\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027", "method": "\u5c06\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f16\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u95ee\u8d23\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u786e\u4fdd\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027"}}

While prior state-of-the-art transfer-based approaches like M-Attack perform well using local crop-level matching between source and target images, we find this induces high-variance, nearly orthogonal gradients across iterations, violating coherent local alignment and destabilizing optimization. We attribute this to (i) ViT translation sensitivity that yields spike-like gradients and (ii) structural asymmetry between source and target crops. We reformulate local matching as an asymmetric expectation over source transformations and target semantics, and build a gradient-denoising upgrade to M-Attack. On the source side, Multi-Crop Alignment (MCA) averages gradients from multiple independently sampled local views per iteration to reduce variance. On the target side, Auxiliary Target Alignment (ATA) replaces aggressive target augmentation with a small auxiliary set from a semantically correlated distribution, producing a smoother, lower-variance target manifold. We further reinterpret momentum as Patch Momentum, replaying historical crop gradients; combined with a refined patch-size ensemble (PE+), this strengthens transferable directions. Together these modules form M-Attack-V2, a simple, modular enhancement over M-Attack that substantially improves transfer-based black-box attacks on frontier LVLMs: boosting success rates on Claude-4.0 from 8% to 30%, Gemini-2.5-Pro from 83% to 97%, and GPT-5 from 98% to 100%, outperforming prior black-box LVLM attacks.

In this paper, we propose VP-VAE (Vector Perturbation VAE), a novel paradigm that decouples representation learning from discretization by eliminating the need for an explicit codebook during training. Our key insight is that, from the neural network's viewpoint, performing quantization primarily manifests as injecting a structured perturbation in latent space. Accordingly, VP-VAE replaces the non-differentiable quantizer with distribution-consistent and scale-adaptive latent perturbations generated via Metropolis--Hastings sampling. This design enables stable training without a codebook while making the model robust to inference-time quantization error. Moreover, under the assumption of approximately uniform latent variables, we derive FSP (Finite Scalar Perturbation), a lightweight variant of VP-VAE that provides a unified theoretical explanation and a practical improvement for FSQ-style fixed quantizers.

This task can benefit from the integration of whole-slide images, bulk transcriptomics, and DNA methylation, which offer complementary views of the patient's condition at diagnosis. However, real-world clinical datasets are often incomplete, with entire modalities missing for a significant fraction of patients. State-of-the-art models rely on available data to create patient-level representations or use generative models to infer missing modalities, but they lack robustness in cases of severe missingness. We propose a Multimodal Contrastive Variational AutoEncoder (MCVAE) to address this issue: modality-specific variational encoders capture the uncertainty in each data source, and a fusion bottleneck with learned gating mechanisms is introduced to normalize the contributions from present modalities. We propose a multi-task objective that combines survival loss and reconstruction loss to regularize patient representations, along with a cross-modal contrastive loss that enforces cross-modal alignment in the latent space. During training, we apply stochastic modality masking to improve the robustness to arbitrary missingness patterns. Extensive evaluations on the TCGA-LUAD (n=475) and TCGA-LUSC (n=446) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in predicting disease-specific survival (DSS) and its robustness to severe missingness scenarios compared to two state-of-the-art models.

However, there are growing concerns about privacy risks, particularly for children. Although existing privacy regulations require companies and organizations to implement protections, doing so can be challenging in practice. To address this challenge, this article proposes a framework based on Privacy-by-Design (PbD), which guides designers and developers to take on a proactive and risk-averse approach to technology design. Our framework includes principles from several privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from the European Union, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) from Canada, and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) from the United States. We map these principles to various stages of applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs), including data collection, model training, operational monitoring, and ongoing validation. For each stage, we discuss the operational controls found in the recent academic literature to help AI service providers and developers reduce privacy risks while meeting legal standards. In addition, the framework includes design guidelines for children, drawing from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), the UK's Age-Appropriate Design Code (AADC), and recent academic research. To demonstrate how this framework can be applied in practice, we present a case study of an LLM-based educational tutor for children under 13. Through our analysis and the case study, we show that by using data protection strategies such as technical and organizational controls and making age-appropriate design decisions throughout the LLM life cycle, we can support the development of AI applications for children that provide privacy protections and comply with legal requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4fdd\u62a4\u513f\u7ae5\u4f7f\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u7684\u9690\u79c1", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u513f\u7ae5\u4f7f\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08PbD\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u8ba8\u8bba", "result": "\u964d\u4f4e\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u513f\u7ae5AI\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53d1\u5c55", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u91c7\u53d6\u4e3b\u52a8\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u89c4\u907f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6280\u672f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u786e\u4fdd\u513f\u7ae5\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4"}}

We propose TimeOmni-VL, the first vision-centric framework that unifies time series understanding and generation through two key innovations: (1) Fidelity-preserving bidirectional mapping between time series and images (Bi-TSI), which advances Time Series-to-Image (TS2I) and Image-to-Time Series (I2TS) conversions to ensure near-lossless transformations. (2) Understanding-guided generation. We introduce TSUMM-Suite, a novel dataset consists of six understanding tasks rooted in time series analytics that are coupled with two generation tasks.

To bridge this gap, we present WarpRec, a high-performance framework that eliminates this trade-off through a novel, backend-agnostic architecture. It includes 50+ state-of-the-art algorithms, 40 metrics, and 19 filtering and splitting strategies that seamlessly transition from local execution to distributed training and optimization. The framework enforces ecological responsibility by integrating CodeCarbon for real-time energy tracking, showing that scalability need not come at the cost of scientific integrity or sustainability. Furthermore, WarpRec anticipates the shift toward Agentic AI, leading Recommender Systems to evolve from static ranking engines into interactive tools within the Generative AI ecosystem. In summary, WarpRec not only bridges the gap between academia and industry but also can serve as the architectural backbone for the next generation of sustainable, agent-ready Recommender Systems.

However, ZO optimization has a fundamental tension between accuracy and query efficiency. In this work, we show that ZO optimization can be substantially improved by unifying two complementary principles: (i) a projection-based subspace view that reduces gradient estimation variance by exploiting the intrinsic low-rank structure of model updates, and (ii) Muon-style spectral optimization that applies gradient orthogonalization to extract informative spectral structure from noisy ZO gradients. These findings form a unified framework of subspace gradient orthogonalization, which we instantiate in a new method, ZO-Muon, admitting a natural interpretation as a low-rank Muon optimizer in the ZO setting. Extensive experiments on large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers (ViTs) demonstrate that ZO-Muon significantly accelerates convergence and achieves a win-win improvement in accuracy and query/runtime efficiency. Notably, compared to the popular MeZO baseline, ZO-Muon requires only 24.7% of the queries to reach the same SST-2 performance for LLM fine-tuning, and improves accuracy by 25.1% on ViT-B fine-tuning on CIFAR-100.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5ZO-Muon\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316(ZO)\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6295\u5f71\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c6\u56fe\u548cMuon-style\u5149\u8c31\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4MeZO\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u67e5\u8be2\u6b21\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8675.3%\uff0c\u5728ViT-B\u5fae\u8c03CIFAR-100\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8625.1%", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5ZO-Muon\uff0c\u4e3a\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6"}}

Two heads (L0H1 and L0H5 in GPT-2 small) function as high-precision membership filters with false positive rates of 0-4\\% even at 180 unique context tokens -- well above the $d_\\text{head} = 64$ bit capacity of a classical Bloom filter. A third head (L1H11) shows the classic Bloom filter capacity curve: its false positive rate follows the theoretical formula $p \\approx (1 - e^{-kn/m})^k$ with $R^2 = 1.0$ and fitted capacity $m \\approx 5$ bits, saturating by $n \\approx 20$ unique tokens. A fourth head initially identified as a Bloom filter (L3H0) was reclassified as a general prefix-attention head after confound controls revealed its apparent capacity curve was a sequence-length artifact. Together, the three genuine membership-testing heads form a multi-resolution system concentrated in early layers (0-1), taxonomically distinct from induction and previous-token heads, with false positive rates that decay monotonically with embedding distance -- consistent with distance-sensitive Bloom filters. These heads generalize broadly: they respond to any repeated token type, not just repeated names, with 43\\% higher generalization than duplicate-token-only heads. Ablation reveals these heads contribute to both repeated and novel token processing, indicating that membership testing coexists with broader computational roles. The reclassification of L3H0 through confound controls strengthens rather than weakens the case: the surviving heads withstand the scrutiny that eliminated a false positive in our own analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9bTransformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5145\u5f53\u6210\u5458\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e4b\u524d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e0e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u89d2\u8272\u5171\u5b58\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Transformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u4e4b\u524d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u56db\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPT-2 small, medium, and large; Pythia-160M\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u6dc6\u63a7\u5236\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u7c7b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u4e2a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff08L0H1, L0H5, L1H11\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5e03\u9686\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u7b2c\u56db\u4e2a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff08L3H0\uff09\u5219\u88ab\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u524d\u7f00\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\uff0c\u4e0e\u5f52\u7eb3\u548c\u524d\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u5934\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5728\u91cd\u590d\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u6807\u8bb0\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u90fd\u6709\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6210\u5458\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u89d2\u8272\u5171\u5b58\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we introduce two novel measures: reusability and verifiability. We decouple CoT generation from execution using a Thinker-Executor framework. Reusability measures how easily an Executor can reuse the Thinker's CoT. Verifiability measures how frequently an Executor can match the Thinker's answer using the CoT. We evaluated four Thinker models against a committee of ten Executor models across five benchmarks. Our results reveal that reusability and verifiability do not correlate with standard accuracy, exposing a blind spot in current accuracy-based leaderboards for reasoning capability.

While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined with domain randomization has shown promise in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, simultaneously handling all sources of uncertainty often leads to sub-optimal policies and poor learning efficiency. This study formulates a new curriculum-based continual learning framework for robust control problems involving nonlinear dynamical systems in which multiple sources of uncertainty are simultaneously superimposed. The key idea is to decompose a complex control problem with multiple uncertainties into a sequence of continual learning tasks, in which strategies for handling each uncertainty are acquired sequentially. The original system is extended into a finite set of plants whose dynamic uncertainties are gradually expanded and diversified as learning progresses. The policy is stably updated across the entire plant sets associated with tasks defined by different uncertainty configurations without catastrophic forgetting. To ensure learning efficiency, we jointly incorporate a model-based controller (MBC), which guarantees a shared baseline performance across the plant sets, into the learning process to accelerate the convergence. This residual learning scheme facilitates task-specific optimization of the DRL agent for each uncertainty, thereby enhancing sample efficiency. As a practical industrial application, this study applies the proposed method to designing an active vibration controller for automotive powertrains. We verified that the resulting controller is robust against structural nonlinearities and dynamic variations, realizing successful sim-to-real transfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5177\u6709\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u63a7\u5236\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5316\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u7ec7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6c7d\u8f66\u52a8\u529b\u603b\u6210\u4e2d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3b\u52a8\u632f\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6210\u529f\u4ece\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

The principle is to first cold-start the model via trajectory-splitting SFT, then scale it via progressive RL training. Specifically, we first activate basic agentic abilities of a base model with a comprehensive SFT recipe. Then, we introduce Research-Factory, an automated pipeline that generates high-quality training data by collecting research papers and constructing evaluation rubrics. Using this pipeline, we build thousands of long-horizon trajectories distilled from Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking). To train with these extremely long trajectories, we propose a new trajectory-splitting SFT, which preserves early context, progressively truncates later context, and maintains overlap between sub-trajectories. In addition, to further improve long-horizon task-solving capability, we propose a novel progressive RL, which schedules training into multiple stages with progressively extended timeouts. Experiments demonstrate the superiority and generalization of KLong, as shown in Figure 1.

However, current methods suffer from two key limitations: \\textit{(i)} the lack of a unified theoretical framework for guiding the design of steering directions, and \\textit{(ii)} an over-reliance on \\textit{one-step steering} that fail to capture complex patterns of activation distributions. In this work, we propose a unified ordinary differential equations (ODEs)-based \\textit{theoretical} framework for activation steering in LLM alignment. We show that conventional activation addition can be interpreted as a first-order approximation to the solution of an ODE. Based on this ODE perspective, identifying a steering direction becomes equivalent to designing a \\textit{barrier function} from control theory. Derived from this framework, we introduce ODESteer, a kind of ODE-based steering guided by barrier functions, which shows \\textit{empirical} advancement in LLM alignment. ODESteer identifies steering directions by defining the barrier function as the log-density ratio between positive and negative activations, and employs it to construct an ODE for \\textit{multi-step and adaptive} steering. Compared to state-of-the-art activation steering methods, ODESteer achieves consistent empirical improvements on diverse LLM alignment benchmarks, a notable $5.7\\%$ improvement over TruthfulQA, $2.5\\%$ over UltraFeedback, and $2.4\\%$ over RealToxicityPrompts.

We show that this failure stems not merely from limited supervision, but from a structural mismatch between noisy, limited supervision and the highly plastic parameter space of EFMs. To address this challenge, we propose SCOPE, a Structured COnfidence-aware Prototype-guided adaptation framework for EFM fine-tuning. SCOPE follows a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we construct reliable external supervision by learning geometry-regularized task priors, constructing balanced class-level prototypes over the resulting embeddings, and producing confidence-aware pseudo-labels from their agreement to filter unreliable signals on unlabeled data. In the second stage, we introduce ProAdapter, which adapts frozen EEG foundation models via a lightweight adapter conditioned on the structured prototypes.

We present a generative modeling framework based on Wasserstein Autoencoders to learn a differentiable latent interface between pulse shaping and downstream beam dynamics. Our empirical findings show that the learned latent space is continuous and interpretable while maintaining high-fidelity reconstructions. Pulse families such as higher-order Gaussians trace coherent trajectories, while standardizing the temporal pulse lengths shows a latent organization correlated with pulse energy. Analysis via principal components and Gaussian Mixture Models reveals a well behaved latent geometry, enabling smooth transitions between distinct pulse types via linear interpolation. The model generalizes from simulated data to real experimental pulse measurements, accurately reconstructing pulses and embedding them consistently into the learned manifold. Overall, the approach reduces reliance on expensive pulse-propagation simulations and facilitates downstream beam dynamics simulation and analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Conventional AI benchmarks typically assess only narrow capabilities in a limited range of human activity. Most are also static, quickly saturating as developers explicitly or implicitly optimize for them. We propose that a more promising way to evaluate human-like general intelligence in AI systems is through a particularly strong form of general game playing: studying how and how well they play and learn to play \\textbf{all conceivable human games}, in comparison to human players with the same level of experience, time, or other resources. We define a \"human game\" to be a game designed by humans for humans, and argue for the evaluative suitability of this space of all such games people can imagine and enjoy -- the \"Multiverse of Human Games\". Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms. As a proof of concept, we generated 100 such games based on the top charts of Apple App Store and Steam, and evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short episodes of play. The best models achieved less than 10\\% of the human average score on the majority of the games, and especially struggled with games that challenge world-model learning, memory and planning. We conclude with a set of next steps for building out the AI GameStore as a practical way to measure and drive progress toward human-like general intelligence in machines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u901a\u8fc7\u6e38\u620f\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86AI\u6e38\u620f\u5546\u5e97\u8fd9\u4e00\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u548c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684AI\u57fa\u51c6\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e2d\u6709\u9650\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u72ed\u7a84\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5927\u591a\u6570\u57fa\u51c6\u4e5f\u662f\u9759\u6001\u7684\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u9488\u5bf9\u5b83\u4eec\u8fdb\u884c\u663e\u5f0f\u6216\u9690\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u5f88\u5feb\u5c31\u4f1a\u9971\u548c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982\u4f55\u548c\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5730\u73a9\u548c\u5b66\u4f1a\u73a9\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u3002\u5b9a\u4e49\u201c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\u201d\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bba\u8bc1\u6240\u6709\u6b64\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u2014\u2014\u5373\u201c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\u591a\u5143\u5b87\u5b99\u201d\u2014\u2014\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002\u5f15\u5165AI\u6e38\u620f\u5546\u5e97\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u56de\u8def\u4e2d\u7684LLM\u6765\u5408\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4eba\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u6765\u81ea\u6d41\u884c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u5b57\u6e38\u620f\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548c\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u6e38\u620f\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u82f9\u679c\u5e94\u7528\u5546\u5e97\u548cSteam\u7684\u9876\u7ea7\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u4e86100\u79cd\u6b64\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u77ed\u6e38\u620f\u7247\u6bb5\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e03\u79cd\u524d\u6cbf\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u3002\u6700\u597d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u5747\u5f97\u5206\u4f4e\u4e8e10%\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6311\u6218\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u540e\u7eed\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4ee5\u6784\u5efaAI\u6e38\u620f\u5546\u5e97\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8861\u91cf\u548c\u63a8\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4e2d\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u8fdb\u6b65\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While graph diffusion models have been widely adopted due to the discrete nature of 2D molecular graphs, existing models suffer from low chemical validity and struggle to meet the desired properties compared to 1D modeling. In this work, we introduce MolHIT, a powerful molecular graph generation framework that overcomes long-standing performance limitations in existing methods. MolHIT is based on the Hierarchical Discrete Diffusion Model, which generalizes discrete diffusion to additional categories that encode chemical priors, and decoupled atom encoding that splits the atom types according to their chemical roles.

Subsequently, many researchers became interested in refining and extending the framework introduced by Wagner, thereby creating various RL environments specialized for graph theory. Moreover, a number of problems from extremal graph theory were solved through the use of RL. In particular, several inequalities concerning the Laplacian spectral radius of graphs were refuted, new lower bounds were obtained for certain Ramsey numbers, and contributions were made to the Tur\u00e1n-type extremal problem in which the forbidden structures are cycles of length three and four.

Theoretical analyses of this sampling scheme (Feldman & Shenfeld, 2025; Dong et al., 2025) lead to bounds that are close to those of Poisson sampling, yet still have two significant shortcomings. First, in many practical settings, the resulting privacy parameters are not tight due to the approximation steps in the analysis. Second, the computed parameters are either the hockey stick or Renyi divergence, both of which introduce overheads when used in privacy loss accounting.\n  In this work, we demonstrate that the privacy loss distribution (PLD) of random allocation applied to any differentially private algorithm can be computed efficiently. When applied to the Gaussian mechanism, our results demonstrate that the privacy-utility trade-off for random allocation is at least as good as that of Poisson subsampling. In particular, random allocation is better suited for training via DP-SGD. To support these computations, our work develops new tools for general privacy loss accounting based on a notion of PLD realization.

Recent advances in graph OOD detection have focused on test-time training techniques that facilitate OOD detection without accessing potential supervisory information (e.g., training data). However, most of these methods employ a one-pass inference paradigm, which prevents them from progressively correcting erroneous predictions to amplify OOD signals.

Specifically, SIGOOD generates a prompt to construct a prompt-enhanced graph that amplifies potential OOD signals. To optimize prompts, SIGOOD introduces an Energy Preference Optimization (EPO) loss, which leverages energy variations between the original test graph and the prompt-enhanced graph. By iteratively optimizing the prompt by involving it into the detection model in a self-improving loop, the resulting optimal prompt-enhanced graph is ultimately used for OOD detection.

In particular, models that achieve high predictive performance may still fail to inspire trust if their key features fluctuate when data completeness changes, undermining reproducibility and downstream decision-making. Here, we present CACTUS (Comprehensive Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures), an explainable machine learning framework explicitly designed to address these challenges in small, heterogeneous, and incomplete clinical datasets. CACTUS integrates feature abstraction, interpretable classification, and systematic feature stability analysis to quantify how consistently informative features are preserved as data quality degrades. Using a real-world haematuria cohort comprising 568 patients evaluated for bladder cancer, we benchmark CACTUS against widely used machine learning approaches, including random forests and gradient boosting methods, under controlled levels of randomly introduced missing data. We demonstrate that CACTUS achieves competitive or superior predictive performance while maintaining markedly higher stability of top-ranked features as missingness increases, including in sex-stratified analyses. Our results show that feature stability provides information complementary to conventional performance metrics and is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of machine learning models applied to biomedical data.

In contrast, physics-based simulation models described by ODEs/PDEs remain interpretable, but may have missing or unknown terms, unable to fully describe real-world observations. We bridge this gap with a novel grey-box method that integrates incomplete physics models directly into generative models. Our approach learns dynamics from observational trajectories alone, without ground-truth physics parameters, in a simulation-free manner that avoids scalability and stability issues of Neural ODEs. The core of our method lies in modelling a structured variational distribution within the flow matching framework, by using two latent encodings: one to model the missing stochasticity and multi-modal velocity, and a second to encode physics parameters as a latent variable with a physics-informed prior. Furthermore, we present an adaptation of the framework to handle second-order dynamics. Our experiments on representative ODE/PDE problems show that our method performs on par with or superior to fully data-driven approaches and previous grey-box baselines, while preserving the interpretability of the physics model.

They are known to severely degrade performance, and the convergence rate under delayed feedback is still unclear, even for bilinear games. This paper derives the rate of linear convergence of Weighted Optimistic Gradient Descent-Ascent (WOGDA), which predicts future rewards with extra optimism, in unconstrained bilinear games. To analyze the algorithm, we interpret it as an approximation of the Extra Proximal Point (EPP), which is updated based on farther future rewards than the classical Proximal Point (PP). Our theorems show that standard optimism (predicting the next-step reward) achieves linear convergence to the equilibrium at a rate $\\exp(-\u0398(t/m^{5}))$ after $t$ iterations for delay $m$. Moreover, employing extra optimism (predicting farther future reward) tolerates a larger step size and significantly accelerates the rate to $\\exp(-\u0398(t/(m^{2}\\log m)))$. Our experiments also show accelerated convergence driven by the extra optimism and are qualitatively consistent with our theorems. In summary, this paper validates that extra optimism is a promising countermeasure against performance degradation caused by feedback delays.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In practice, however, they exhibit a sharp degradation of sample quality in the few-step regime, failing to realize this promise. Here we show that language models leveraging flow-based continuous denoising can outperform discrete diffusion in both quality and speed. By revisiting the fundamentals of flows over discrete modalities, we build a flow-based language model (FLM) that performs Euclidean denoising over one-hot token encodings. We show that the model can be trained by predicting the clean data via a cross entropy objective, where we introduce a simple time reparameterization that greatly improves training stability and generation quality. By distilling FLM into its associated flow map, we obtain a distilled flow map language model (FMLM) capable of few-step generation. On the LM1B and OWT language datasets, FLM attains generation quality matching state-of-the-art discrete diffusion models. With FMLM, our approach outperforms recent few-step language models across the board, with one-step generation exceeding their 8-step quality. Our work calls into question the widely held hypothesis that discrete diffusion processes are necessary for generative modeling over discrete modalities, and paves the way toward accelerated flow-based language modeling at scale.

CRAFT bridges these two lines of work: it performs full Tucker decomposition via Higher-Order SVD (HOSVD) directly on pre-trained weights organized as cross-layer 3D tensors, freezes all resulting factors, and adapts the model through lightweight trainable transformations applied to each factor matrix.

The field has largely converged on three public multi-label benchmarks (PTB-XL, CPSC2018, CSN) dominated by arrhythmia and waveform-morphology labels, even though the ECG is known to encode substantially broader clinical information. We argue that downstream evaluation should expand to include an assessment of structural heart disease and patient-level forecasting, in addition to other evolving ECG-related endpoints, as relevant clinical targets. Next, we outline evaluation best practices for multi-label, imbalanced settings, and show that when they are applied, the literature's current conclusion about which representations perform best is altered. Furthermore, we demonstrate the surprising result that a randomly initialized encoder with linear evaluation matches state-of-the-art pre-training on many tasks.

To bridge these gaps, we propose Mass-Adaptive Soft Policy Optimization (MASPO), a unified framework designed to harmonize these three dimensions.

But, matching similarities is weaker than establishing an explicit correspondence between the representation spaces, especially for multimodal models, where consistency must hold not only within each modality, but also for the learned image-text coupling. We therefore ask: given two independently trained multimodal contrastive models (with encoders $(f, g)$ and $(\\widetilde{f},\\widetilde{g})$) -- trained on different distributions and with different architectures -- does a systematic geometric relationship exist between their embedding spaces? If so, what form does it take, and does it hold uniformly across modalities? In this work, we show that across model families such as CLIP, SigLIP, and FLAVA, this geometric relationship is well approximated by an orthogonal map (up to a global mean shift), i.e., there exists an orthogonal map $Q$ where $Q^\\top Q = I$ such that $\\widetilde{f}(x)\\approx Q f(x)$ for paired images $x$. Strikingly, the same $Q$ simultaneously aligns the text encoders i.e., $\\widetilde{g}(y)\\approx Q g(y)$ for texts $y$. Theoretically, we prove that if the multimodal kernel agrees across models on a small anchor set i.e. $\\langle f(x), g(y)\\rangle \\approx \\langle \\widetilde{f}(x), \\widetilde{g}(y)\\rangle$, then the two models must be related by a single orthogonal map $Q$ and the same $Q$ maps images and text across models.

Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training of machine learning (ML) models across clients without data centralization. Decentralized training, however, introduces a computational burden on client devices. U-shaped federated split learning (UFSL) offloads a fraction of the client computation to the server while keeping both data and labels on the clients' side. However, the intermediate representations (i.e., smashed data) shared by clients with the server are prone to exposing clients' private data. To reduce exposure of client data through intermediate data representations, this work proposes k-anonymous differentially private UFSL (KD-UFSL), which leverages privacy-enhancing techniques such as microaggregation and differential privacy to minimize data leakage from the smashed data transferred to the server. We first demonstrate that an adversary can access private client data from intermediate representations via a data-reconstruction attack, and then present a privacy-enhancing solution, KD-UFSL, to mitigate this risk. Our experiments indicate that, alongside increasing the mean squared error between the actual and reconstructed images by up to 50% in some cases, KD-UFSL also decreases the structural similarity between them by up to 40% on four benchmarking datasets.

While federated learning (FL) provides a privacy-enhancing training mechanism, it assumes a static data flow and learns a collaborative model over multiple rounds, making learning with \\textit{incremental} data challenging in limited-communication scenarios. This paper presents One-Shot Incremental Federated Learning (OSI-FL), the first FL framework that addresses the dual challenges of communication overhead and catastrophic forgetting. OSI-FL communicates category-specific embeddings, devised by a frozen vision-language model (VLM) from each client in a single communication round, which a pre-trained diffusion model at the server uses to synthesize new data similar to the client's data distribution. The synthesized samples are used on the server for training. However, two challenges still persist: i) tasks arriving incrementally need to retrain the global model, and ii) as future tasks arrive, retraining the model introduces catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we augment training with Selective Sample Retention (SSR), which identifies and retains the top-p most informative samples per category and task pair based on sample loss. SSR bounds forgetting by ensuring that representative retained samples are incorporated into training in further iterations.

We adopt a human centric view governed by two principles: counterfactual harm, ensuring the AI does not undermine human strengths, and complementarity, ensuring it adds value where the human is prone to err. We formalize these concepts via user defined rules, allowing users to specify exactly what harm and complementarity mean for their specific task. We then introduce an online, distribution free algorithm with finite sample guarantees that enforces the user-specified constraints over the collaboration dynamics. We evaluate our framework across two interactive settings: LLM simulated collaboration on a medical diagnostic task and a human crowdsourcing study on a pictorial reasoning task. We show that our online procedure maintains prescribed counterfactual harm and complementarity violation rates even under nonstationary interaction dynamics. Moreover, tightening or loosening these constraints produces predictable shifts in downstream human accuracy, confirming that the two principles serve as practical levers for steering multi-round collaboration toward better decision quality without the need to model or constrain human behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u786e\u4fdd\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0fAI\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u786e\u4fdd\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0fAI\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u6b64\u7c7b\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u8fdb\u884c\u6cbb\u7406\uff1a\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4f24\u5bb3\u548c\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u4e3a\u5176\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u6307\u5b9a\u4f24\u5bb3\u548c\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u7684\u786e\u5207\u542b\u4e49\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u7ebf\u3001\u65e0\u5206\u5e03\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff1aLLM\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7247\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684 crowdsourcing\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u6001\u4e0b\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u89c4\u5b9a\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4f24\u5bb3\u548c\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u8fdd\u89c4\u7387\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6536\u7d27\u6216\u653e\u5bbd\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u5730\u6539\u53d8\u4e0b\u6e38\u4eba\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u662f\u5f15\u5bfc\u591a\u8f6e\u534f\u4f5c\u8d70\u5411\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6760\u6746\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9\u6216\u7ea6\u675f\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u5219\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u786e\u4fdd\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0fAI\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, training reliable reward models relies heavily on human-labeled preference data, which is costly and limited, motivating the use of data augmentation. Existing augmentation approaches typically operate at the representation or semantic level and remain agnostic to the reward model's estimation difficulty. In this paper, we propose MARS, an adaptive, margin-aware augmentation and sampling strategy that explicitly targets ambiguous and failure modes of the reward model. Our proposed framework, MARS, concentrates augmentation on low-margin (ambiguous) preference pairs where the reward model is most uncertain, and iteratively refines the training distribution via hard-sample augmentation.

Moving beyond CP as a standalone operation (procedural fairness), we analyze the holistic decision-making pipeline to evaluate substantive fairness-the equity of downstream outcomes. Theoretically, we derive an upper bound that decomposes prediction-set size disparity into interpretable components, clarifying how label-clustered CP helps control method-driven contributions to unfairness. To facilitate scalable empirical analysis, we introduce an LLM-in-the-loop evaluator that approximates human assessment of substantive fairness across diverse modalities. Our experiments reveal that label-clustered CP variants consistently deliver superior substantive fairness. Finally, we empirically show that equalized set sizes, rather than coverage, strongly correlate with improved substantive fairness, enabling practitioners to design more fair CP systems.
