TL;DR: 开发了一种名为COMPASS的系统，用于AI驱动的自适应放射治疗，以更精确地预测和治疗毒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更精确的放射治疗，开发了COMPASS系统，以利用AI对正常组织生物学进行时间序列建模。

Method: 利用GRU自动编码器学习器官特异性潜在轨迹，并通过逻辑回归进行分类以预测毒性等级。

Result: 在BGRT治疗的NSCLC患者中，发现了一个可行的AI驱动早期预警窗口，以及与传统剂量学相比，生物相关空间剂量纹理特征在毒性发生前出现。

Conclusion: COMPASS系统为AI驱动的自适应放射治疗提供了一个概念验证，其中治疗由不断更新的数字孪生指导，以跟踪每个患者的生物反应演变。

Abstract: Radiotherapy continues to become more precise and data dense, with current treatment regimens generating high frequency imaging and dosimetry streams ideally suited for AI driven temporal modeling to characterize how normal tissues evolve with time. Each fraction in biologically guided radiotherapy(BGRT) treated non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients records new metabolic, anatomical, and dose information. However, clinical decision making is largely informed by static, population based NTCP models which overlook the dynamic, unique biological trajectories encoded in sequential data. We developed COMPASS (Comprehensive Personalized Assessment System) for safe radiotherapy, functioning as a temporal digital twin architecture utilizing per fraction PET, CT, dosiomics, radiomics, and cumulative biologically equivalent dose (BED) kinetics to model normal tissue biology as a dynamic time series process. A GRU autoencoder was employed to learn organ specific latent trajectories, which were classified via logistic regression to predict eventual CTCAE grade 1 or higher toxicity. Eight NSCLC patients undergoing BGRT contributed to the 99 organ fraction observations covering 24 organ trajectories (spinal cord, heart, and esophagus). Despite the small cohort, intensive temporal phenotyping allowed for comprehensive analysis of individual dose response dynamics. Our findings revealed a viable AI driven early warning window, as increasing risk ratings occurred from several fractions before clinical toxicity. The dense BED driven representation revealed biologically relevant spatial dose texture characteristics that occur before toxicity and are averaged out with traditional volume based dosimetry. COMPASS establishes a proof of concept for AI enabled adaptive radiotherapy, where treatment is guided by a continually updated digital twin that tracks each patients evolving biological response.

TL;DR: 通过增强现实技术，MARVUS显著提高了超声体积测量的准确性和可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确体积描述对于肿瘤诊断、风险分层和治疗规划至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种名为MARVUS的资源高效系统，该系统使用增强现实(AR)技术提高超声体积测量的准确性和可重复性。

Result: 在用户研究中，与现有3D-US解决方案相比，MARVUS在体积估计精度和用户间变异性方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: MARVUS有望提高基于超声的癌症筛查、诊断流程和治疗规划的质量，同时具有可扩展性、成本效益和资源效率。

Abstract: Accurate volumetric characterization of lesions is essential for oncologic diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment planning. While imaging modalities such as Computed Tomography provide high-quality 3D data, 2D ultrasound (2D-US) remains the preferred first-line modality for breast and thyroid imaging due to cost, portability, and safety factors. However, volume estimates derived from 2D-US suffer from high inter-user variability even among experienced clinicians. Existing 3D ultrasound (3D-US) solutions use specialized probes or external tracking hardware, but such configurations increase costs and diminish portability, constraining widespread clinical use. To address these limitations, we present Mobile Augmented Reality Volumetric Ultrasound (MARVUS), a resource-efficient system designed to increase accessibility to accurate and reproducible volumetric assessment. MARVUS is interoperable with conventional ultrasound (US) systems, using a foundation model to enhance cross-specialty generalization while minimizing hardware requirements relative to current 3D-US solutions. In a user study involving experienced clinicians performing measurements on breast phantoms, MARVUS yielded a substantial improvement in volume estimation accuracy (mean difference: 0.469 cm3) with reduced inter-user variability (mean difference: 0.417 cm3). Additionally, we prove that augmented reality (AR) visualizations enhance objective performance metrics and clinician-reported usability. Collectively, our findings suggests that MARVUS can enhance US-based cancer screening, diagnostic workflows, and treatment planning in a scalable, cost-conscious, and resource-efficient manner.

### [3] [Mitigating Shortcut Learning via Feature Disentanglement in Medical Imaging: A Benchmark Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18502)

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少医学图像中深度学习模型的捷径学习，降低临床应用风险。

Method: 系统评估特征解耦方法，包括对抗学习和基于依赖最小化的潜在空间分割。

Result: 捷径缓解方法在训练过程中降低虚假相关性下的分类性能，最佳模型结合数据平衡和模型解耦，提高性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 特征解耦方法有效减轻了医学图像中深度学习模型的捷径学习，提高了模型性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Although deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve excellent classification performance, they can rely on shortcut learning, exploiting spurious correlations or confounding factors that are not causally related to the target task. This poses risks in clinical settings, where models must generalize across institutions, populations, and acquisition conditions. Feature disentanglement is a promising approach to mitigate shortcut learning by separating task-relevant information from confounder-related features in latent representations. In this study, we systematically evaluated feature disentanglement methods for mitigating shortcuts in medical imaging, including adversarial learning and latent space splitting based on dependence minimization. We assessed classification performance and disentanglement quality using latent space analyses across one artificial and two medical datasets with natural and synthetic confounders. We also examined robustness under varying levels of confounding and compared computational efficiency across methods. We found that shortcut mitigation methods improved classification performance under strong spurious correlations during training. Latent space analyses revealed differences in representation quality not captured by classification metrics, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each method. Model reliance on shortcuts depended on the degree of confounding in the training data. The best-performing models combine data-centric rebalancing with model-centric disentanglement, achieving stronger and more robust shortcut mitigation than rebalancing alone while maintaining similar computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Clubs with access to expensive multi-camera setups or GPS tracking systems gain a competitive advantage through detailed data, whereas lower-budget teams are often unable to collect similar information. This paper examines whether such data can instead be extracted directly from standard broadcast footage using a single-camera computer vision pipeline. This project develops an end-to-end system that combines a YOLO object detector with the ByteTrack tracking algorithm to identify and track players, referees, goalkeepers, and the ball throughout a match. Experimental results show that the pipeline achieves high performance in detecting and tracking players and officials, with strong precision, recall, and mAP50 scores, while ball detection remains the primary challenge. Despite this limitation, our findings demonstrate that AI can extract meaningful player-level spatial information from a single broadcast camera. By reducing reliance on specialized hardware, the proposed approach enables colleges, academies, and amateur clubs to adopt scalable, data-driven analysis methods previously accessible only to professional teams, highlighting the potential for affordable computer vision-based soccer analytics.

*Holly Jackson,Caleb Adams,Ignacio Lopez-Francos,Benjamin Recht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从模糊图像中恢复深度的全局优化方法，该方法在基准数据集上取得了比现有深度学习方法更好的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恢复从模糊图像集中获取深度仍然是一个计算上具有挑战性的优化问题。

Method: 交替最小化方法，结合凸优化和平行网格搜索。

Result: 在比当前深度学习方法更高的分辨率上有效地解决了深度从模糊的问题，并在基准数据集上展示了有希望的结果。

Conclusion: 证明了使用当代优化方法和合理的计算资源，从模糊图像中恢复深度是可行的。

Abstract: Though there exists a reasonable forward model for blur based on optical physics, recovering depth from a collection of defocused images remains a computationally challenging optimization problem. In this paper, we show that with contemporary optimization methods and reasonable computing resources, a global optimization approach to depth from defocus is feasible. Our approach rests on alternating minimization. When holding the depth map fixed, the forward model is linear with respect to the all-in-focus image. When holding the all-in-focus image fixed, the depth at each pixel can be computed independently, enabling embarrassingly parallel computation. We show that alternating between convex optimization and parallel grid search can effectively solve the depth-from-defocus problem at higher resolutions than current deep learning methods. We demonstrate our approach on benchmark datasets with synthetic and real defocus blur and show promising results compared to prior approaches. Our code is available at github.com/hollyjackson/dfd.

### [6] [Sketch2Feedback: Grammar-in-the-Loop Framework for Rubric-Aligned Feedback on Student STEM Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18520)
*Aayam Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的框架，用于提供图表反馈，并在基准测试中取得了良好的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在STEM教育中，及时提供与评分标准一致的反馈对学生绘制的图表是一个持续的挑战。

Method: 提出Sketch2Feedback，一个语法在循环框架，将问题分解为四个阶段：混合感知、符号图构建、约束检查和约束VLM反馈。

Result: 在两个合成微基准测试FBD-10和Circuit-10上评估，结果显示Qwen2-VL-7B在FBD和电路方面均取得了最高的micro-F1，但幻觉率极高。集成预言机在FBD上达到F1=0.556，幻觉率为0.320。

Conclusion: 语法管道比端到端LMM产生更多可操作的电路反馈。

Abstract: Providing timely, rubric-aligned feedback on student-drawn diagrams is a persistent challenge in STEM education. While large multimodal models (LMMs) can jointly parse images and generate explanations, their tendency to hallucinate undermines trust in classroom deployments. We present Sketch2Feedback, a grammar-in-the-loop framework that decomposes the problem into four stages -- hybrid perception, symbolic graph construction, constraint checking, and constrained VLM feedback -- so that the language model verbalizes only violations verified by an upstream rule engine. We evaluate on two synthetic micro-benchmarks, FBD-10 (free-body diagrams) and Circuit-10 (circuit schematics), each with 500 images spanning standard and hard noise augmentation tiers, comparing our pipeline against end-to-end LMMs (LLaVA-1.5-7B, Qwen2-VL-7B), a vision-only detector, a YOLOv8-nano learned detector, and an ensemble oracle. On n=100 test samples per benchmark with 95% bootstrap CIs, results are mixed and instructive: Qwen2-VL-7B achieves the highest micro-F1 on both FBDs (0.570) and circuits (0.528), but with extreme hallucination rates (0.78, 0.98). An ensemble oracle that selects the best prediction per sample reaches F1=0.556 with hallucination 0.320 on FBDs, demonstrating exploitable complementarity between grammar and end-to-end approaches. Confidence thresholding at tau=0.7 reduces circuit hallucination from 0.970 to 0.880 with no F1 loss. Hard noise augmentation reveals domain-dependent robustness: FBD detection is resilient while circuit detection degrades sharply. An LLM-as-judge evaluation confirms that the grammar pipeline produces more actionable circuit feedback (4.85/5) than the end-to-end LMM (3.11/5). We release all code, datasets, and evaluation scripts.

### [7] [Do Generative Metrics Predict YOLO Performance? An Evaluation Across Models, Augmentation Ratios, and Dataset Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18525)
*Vasile Marian,Yong-Bin Kang,Alexander Buddery*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 合成增强提高了YOLOv11在特定检测环境中的性能，但效果受到检测环境和增强水平的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了可靠地评估合成数据集在训练之前的性能，提出了一种针对YOLOv11的合成增强方法。

Method: 通过在三种不同的检测环境中对六种生成器进行基准测试，包括GAN、扩散和混合型生成器，并评估YOLOv11在真实测试集上的性能。

Result: 在更具挑战性的检测环境中，合成增强带来了显著的性能提升，但在交通标志检测中效果有限。

Conclusion: 合成增强可以显著提高YOLOv11在特定检测环境中的性能，但其效果受到检测环境和增强水平的影响。

Abstract: Synthetic images are increasingly used to augment object-detection training sets, but reliably evaluating a synthetic dataset before training remains difficult: standard global generative metrics (e.g., FID) often do not predict downstream detection mAP. We present a controlled evaluation of synthetic augmentation for YOLOv11 across three single-class detection regimes -- Traffic Signs (sparse/near-saturated), Cityscapes Pedestrian (dense/occlusion-heavy), and COCO PottedPlant (multi-instance/high-variability). We benchmark six GAN-, diffusion-, and hybrid-based generators over augmentation ratios from 10% to 150% of the real training split, and train YOLOv11 both from scratch and with COCO-pretrained initialization, evaluating on held-out real test splits (mAP@0.50:0.95). For each dataset-generator-augmentation configuration, we compute pre-training dataset metrics under a matched-size bootstrap protocol, including (i) global feature-space metrics in both Inception-v3 and DINOv2 embeddings and (ii) object-centric distribution distances over bounding-box statistics. Synthetic augmentation yields substantial gains in the more challenging regimes (up to +7.6% and +30.6% relative mAP in Pedestrian and PottedPlant, respectively) but is marginal in Traffic Signs and under pretrained fine-tuning. To separate metric signal from augmentation quantity, we report both raw and augmentation-controlled (residualized) correlations with multiple-testing correction, showing that metric-performance alignment is strongly regime-dependent and that many apparent raw associations weaken after controlling for augmentation level.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较多种深度学习架构在土耳其五种本地黑橄榄品种的图像分类中的性能。

Method: 使用2500张图像的数据集，通过迁移学习训练了十种架构，并使用多个指标评估模型性能。

Result: EfficientNetV2-S在分类精度方面表现最佳，而EfficientNetB0在精度和计算复杂度之间提供了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 在数据有限的情况下，参数效率比模型深度本身更重要。

Abstract: This study compares multiple deep learning architectures for the automated, image-based classification of five locally cultivated black table olive varieties in Turkey: Gemlik, Ayvalik, Uslu, Erkence, and Celebi. Using a dataset of 2500 images, ten architectures - MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetV2-S, ResNet50, ResNet101, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, ConvNeXt-Tiny, ViT-B16, and Swin-T - were trained using transfer learning. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Cohen's Kappa, ROC-AUC, number of parameters, FLOPs, inference time, and generalization gap. EfficientNetV2-S achieved the highest classification accuracy (95.8%), while EfficientNetB0 provided the best trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. Overall, the results indicate that under limited data conditions, parametric efficiency plays a more critical role than model depth alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了对Vision-Language-Action模型（VLA）的设计空间进行结构化分析，并识别真正重要的设计选择。

Method: 通过一个统一的框架和评估设置，对VLA设计空间进行系统分析，从基础组件、感知要素和动作建模三个方面 dissect 设计选择。

Result: 提炼出12个关键发现，形成构建强大VLA模型的实用方案。VLANeXt模型在LIBERO和LIBERO-plus基准测试中优于现有方法，并在实际实验中展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: VLANeXt模型是简单而有效的，为VLA模型构建提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Following the rise of large foundation models, Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) emerged, leveraging strong visual and language understanding for general-purpose policy learning. Yet, the current VLA landscape remains fragmented and exploratory. Although many groups have proposed their own VLA models, inconsistencies in training protocols and evaluation settings make it difficult to identify which design choices truly matter. To bring structure to this evolving space, we reexamine the VLA design space under a unified framework and evaluation setup. Starting from a simple VLA baseline similar to RT-2 and OpenVLA, we systematically dissect design choices along three dimensions: foundational components, perception essentials, and action modelling perspectives. From this study, we distill 12 key findings that together form a practical recipe for building strong VLA models. The outcome of this exploration is a simple yet effective model, VLANeXt. VLANeXt outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on the LIBERO and LIBERO-plus benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalization in real-world experiments. We will release a unified, easy-to-use codebase that serves as a common platform for the community to reproduce our findings, explore the design space, and build new VLA variants on top of a shared foundation.

### [10] [Morphological Addressing of Identity Basins in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18533)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We demonstrate that morphological pressure creates navigable gradients at multiple levels of the text-to-image generative pipeline. In Study~1, identity basins in Stable Diffusion 1.5 can be navigated using morphological descriptors -- constituent features like platinum blonde,'' beauty mark,'' and 1950s glamour'' -- without the target's name or photographs. A self-distillation loop (generating synthetic images from descriptor prompts, then training a LoRA on those outputs) achieves consistent convergence toward a specific identity as measured by ArcFace similarity. The trained LoRA creates a local coordinate system shaping not only the target identity but also its inverse: maximal away-conditioning produces eldritch'' structural breakdown in base SD1.5, while the LoRA-equipped model produces ``uncanny valley'' outputs -- coherent but precisely wrong. In Study~2, we extend this to prompt-level morphology. Drawing on phonestheme theory, we generate 200 novel nonsense words from English sound-symbolic clusters (e.g., \emph{cr-}, \emph{sn-}, \emph{-oid}, \emph{-ax}) and find that phonestheme-bearing candidates produce significantly more visually coherent outputs than random controls (mean Purity@1 = 0.371 vs.\ 0.209, p<0.00001p < 0.00001 p<0.00001, Cohen's d=0.55d = 0.55 d=0.55). Three candidates -- \emph{snudgeoid}, \emph{crashax}, and \emph{broomix} -- achieve perfect visual consistency (Purity@1 = 1.0) with zero training data contamination, each generating a distinct, coherent visual identity from phonesthetic structure alone. Together, these studies establish that morphological structure -- whether in feature descriptors or prompt-level phonological form -- creates systematic navigational gradients through diffusion model latent spaces. We document phase transitions in identity basins, CFG-invariant identity stability, and novel visual concepts emerging from sub-lexical sound patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）在标注啮齿动物行为视频方面的能力。

Method: 创建一个名为Rodent-Bench的新基准，包括使用不同的行为数据集，提供两个基准版本以适应不同的模型能力，并建立标准化评估指标。

Result: 没有模型在所有数据集上表现出足够的性能，识别出当前MLLMs在科学视频标注中的关键局限性。

Conclusion: Rodent-Bench为追踪可靠自动行为标注在神经科学研究中的进展奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present Rodent-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to annotate rodent behaviour footage. We evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs, including Gemini-2.5-Pro, Gemini-2.5-Flash and Qwen-VL-Max, using this benchmark and find that none of these models perform strongly enough to be used as an assistant for this task. Our benchmark encompasses diverse datasets spanning multiple behavioral paradigms including social interactions, grooming, scratching, and freezing behaviors, with videos ranging from 10 minutes to 35 minutes in length. We provide two benchmark versions to accommodate varying model capabilities and establish standardized evaluation metrics including second-wise accuracy, macro F1, mean average precision, mutual information, and Matthew's correlation coefficient. While some models show modest performance on certain datasets (notably grooming detection), overall results reveal significant challenges in temporal segmentation, handling extended video sequences, and distinguishing subtle behavioral states. Our analysis identifies key limitations in current MLLMs for scientific video annotation and provides insights for future model development. Rodent-Bench serves as a foundation for tracking progress toward reliable automated behavioral annotation in neuroscience research.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Precise localization and recognition of flowers are crucial for advancing automated agriculture, particularly in plant phenotyping, crop estimation, and yield monitoring. This paper benchmarks several YOLO architectures such as YOLOv5s, YOLOv8n/s/m, and YOLOv12n for flower object detection under two annotation regimes: single-image single-bounding box (SISBB) and single-image multiple-bounding box (SIMBB). The FloralSix dataset, comprising 2,816 high-resolution photos of six different flower species, is also introduced. It is annotated for both dense (clustered) and sparse (isolated) scenarios. The models were evaluated using Precision, Recall, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) at IoU thresholds of 0.5 (mAP@0.5) and 0.5-0.95 (mAP@0.5:0.95). In SISBB, YOLOv8m (SGD) achieved the best results with Precision 0.956, Recall 0.951, mAP@0.5 0.978, and mAP@0.5:0.95 0.865, illustrating strong accuracy in detecting isolated flowers. With mAP@0.5 0.934 and mAP@0.5:0.95 0.752, YOLOv12n (SGD) outperformed the more complicated SIMBB scenario, proving robustness in dense, multi-object detection. Results show how annotation density, IoU thresholds, and model size interact: recall-optimized models perform better in crowded environments, whereas precision-oriented models perform best in sparse scenarios. In both cases, the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer consistently performed better than alternatives. These density-sensitive sensors are helpful for non-destructive crop analysis, growth tracking, robotic pollination, and stress evaluation.

TL;DR: 较小的ViT片大小在医学图像分类中提高了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学领域，ViT的片大小对其分类性能的影响尚不明确，特别是在存在二维和三维成像模态的情况下。

Method: 使用12个医学成像数据集，对不同的片大小（1、2、4、7、14、28）进行ViT模型的微调，并评估分类性能。

Result: 较小的片大小（1、2和4）在几乎所有数据集上均实现了最佳结果。2D数据集的平衡准确率提高了12.78%（片大小2 vs. 28），3D数据集提高了23.78%（片大小1 vs. 14）。通过融合不同片大小的模型预测，2D数据集的性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: 在医学图像分析中，ViT的片大小对分类性能有显著影响，较小的片大小可以显著提高性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) and their variants have become state-of-the-art in many computer vision tasks and are widely used as backbones in large-scale vision and vision-language foundation models. While substantial research has focused on architectural improvements, the impact of patch size, a crucial initial design choice in ViTs, remains underexplored, particularly in medical domains where both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) imaging modalities exist.
  In this study, using 12 medical imaging datasets from various imaging modalities (including seven 2D and five 3D datasets), we conduct a thorough evaluation of how different patch sizes affect ViT classification performance. Using a single graphical processing unit (GPU) and a range of patch sizes (1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28), we fine-tune ViT models and observe consistent improvements in classification performance with smaller patch sizes (1, 2, and 4), which achieve the best results across nearly all datasets. More specifically, our results indicate improvements in balanced accuracy of up to 12.78% for 2D datasets (patch size 2 vs. 28) and up to 23.78% for 3D datasets (patch size 1 vs. 14), at the cost of increased computational expense. Moreover, by applying a straightforward ensemble strategy that fuses the predictions of the models trained with patch sizes 1, 2, and 4, we demonstrate a further boost in performance in most cases, especially for the 2D datasets. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/HealMaDe/MedViT

Abstract: We present a novel approach for generating realistic speaking and talking faces by synthesizing a person's voice and facial movements from a static image, a voice profile, and a target text. The model encodes the prompt/driving text, the driving image, and the voice profile of an individual and then combines them to pass them to the multi-entangled latent space to foster key-value pairs and queries for the audio and video modality generation pipeline. The multi-entangled latent space is responsible for establishing the spatiotemporal person-specific features between the modalities. Further, entangled features are passed to the respective decoder of each modality for output audio and video generation.

TL;DR: Video-TwG通过Think-with-Grounding和课程强化策略提升长视频理解，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解由于长时域内丰富的多模态线索而具有挑战性。现有方法通过文本推理来提高模型分析长视频中复杂视频线索的能力。然而，由于长视频的时间冗余，在有限的视频上下文长度下，纯文本推理可能会加剧幻觉，因为详细的关键线索通常会被忽略。

Method: 提出了Video-TwG，这是一种课程强化框架，采用了一种新颖的“Think-with-Grounding”范式，使视频LLM能够主动决定在交错文本-视频推理期间何时进行按需 grounding，仅在必要时对问题相关的片段进行选择性放大。

Result: Video-TwG可以以简单的方式进行端到端训练，无需依赖复杂的辅助模块或大量的注释推理轨迹。实验表明，Video-TwG在Video-MME、LongVideoBench和MLVU上的表现优于强大的LVU基线。消融实验验证了我们的双阶段强化课程策略的必要性，并表明我们的TwG-GRPO更好地利用了多样化的未标记数据来提高grounding质量，同时不牺牲QA性能。

Conclusion: Video-TwG通过Think-with-Grounding范式和课程强化策略，有效地提高了长视频理解的能力，并在多个数据集上取得了优于基线的性能。

Abstract: Long video understanding is challenging due to rich and complicated multimodal clues in long temporal range.Current methods adopt reasoning to improve the model's ability to analyze complex video clues in long videos via text-form reasoning.However,the existing literature suffers from the fact that the text-only reasoning under fixed video context may exacerbate hallucinations since detailed crucial clues are often ignored under limited video context length due to the temporal redundancy of long videos.To address this gap,we propose Video-TwG,a curriculum reinforced framework that employs a novel Think-with-Grounding paradigm,enabling video LLMs to actively decide when to perform on-demand grounding during interleaved text-video reasoning, selectively zooming into question-relevant clips only when necessary.Video-TwG can be trained end-to-end in a straightforward manner, without relying on complex auxiliary modules or heavily annotated reasoning tracesIn detail,we design a Two-stage Reinforced Curriculum Strategy, where the model first learns think-with-grounding behavior on a small short-video GQA dataset with grounding labels,and then scales to diverse general QA data with videos of diverse domains to encourage generalization. Further, to handle complex think-with-grounding reasoning for various kinds of data,we propose TwG-GRPO algorithm which features the fine-grained grounding reward, self-confirmed pseudo reward and accuracy-gated mechanism.Finally,we propose to construct a new TwG-51K dataset that facilitates training. Experiments on Video-MME, LongVideoBench, and MLVU show that Video-TwG consistently outperforms strong LVU baselines.Further ablation validates the necessity of our Two-stage Reinforced Curriculum Strategy and shows our TwG-GRPO better leverages diverse unlabeled data to improve grounding quality and reduce redundant groundings without sacrificing QA performance.

Conclusion: IRIS-SLAM is an effective RGB semantic SLAM system with superior performance in map consistency and loop closure reliability.

Abstract: Geometry foundation models have significantly advanced dense geometric SLAM, yet existing systems often lack deep semantic understanding and robust loop closure capabilities. Meanwhile, contemporary semantic mapping approaches are frequently hindered by decoupled architectures and fragile data association. We propose IRIS-SLAM, a novel RGB semantic SLAM system that leverages unified geometric-instance representations derived from an instance-extended foundation model. By extending a geometry foundation model to concurrently predict dense geometry and cross-view consistent instance embeddings, we enable a semantic-synergized association mechanism and instance-guided loop closure detection. Our approach effectively utilizes viewpoint-agnostic semantic anchors to bridge the gap between geometric reconstruction and open-vocabulary mapping. Experimental results demonstrate that IRIS-SLAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in map consistency and wide-baseline loop closure reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在现实世界部署中的可靠性问题，特别是对象幻觉问题，提出了一种新的模型编辑方法。

Method: 对基于三个大型语言模型背骨（Qwen、LLaMA和Vicuna）的LVLM解码器进行了系统分析，引入了幻觉不敏感性得分（HIS）作为量化指标，并提出了幻觉不敏感性模型编辑（HIME）方法。

Result: HIME方法在多个开放式生成基准测试中平均减少了61.8%的幻觉，同时没有引入额外的参数、推理时间延迟或计算开销。

Conclusion: HIME方法可以有效地抑制LVLMs中的幻觉，同时保留预训练知识，为LVLMs的可靠部署提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal understanding capabilities, yet they remain prone to object hallucination, where models describe non-existent objects or attribute incorrect factual information, raising serious concerns for reliable real-world deployment. While fine-tuning is a commonly adopted mitigation strategy, its high computational cost and practical difficulty motivate the need for training-free alternatives, among which model editing has recently emerged as a promising direction. However, indiscriminate editing risks disrupting the rich implicit knowledge encoded in pre-trained LVLMs, leading to a fundamental question: how much intervention is necessary at each layer to suppress hallucinations while preserving pre-trained knowledge? To address this question, we present a systematic analysis of LVLM decoders built on three widely used large language model backbones-Qwen, LLaMA, and Vicuna-revealing clear layer-wise differences in susceptibility to object hallucination. Building on these insights, we introduce the Hallucination Insensitivity Score (HIS), a principled metric that quantifies each layer's sensitivity to hallucination and provides guidance for targeted intervention. Leveraging HIS, we propose Hallucination Insensitivity Model Editing (HIME), a simple yet effective layer-adaptive weight editing approach that selectively modifies latent features to suppress hallucinations while preserving pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIME reduces hallucinations by an average of 61.8% across open-ended generation benchmarks, including CHAIR, MME, and GPT-4V-aided evaluation, without introducing additional parameters, inference-time latency, or computational overhead.

Motivation: Millimeter-wave Human Pose Estimation (mmWave HPE) promises privacy but suffers from poor generalization under distribution shifts.

Method: Introduce WiCompass, a coverage-aware data-collection framework. WiCompass leverages large-scale motion-capture corpora to build a universal pose space ``oracle''.

Result: WiCompass consistently improves OOD accuracy at matched budgets and exhibits superior scaling behavior compared to conventional collection strategies.

Conclusion: By shifting focus from brute-force scaling to coverage-aware data acquisition, this work offers a practical path toward robust mmWave sensing.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave Human Pose Estimation (mmWave HPE) promises privacy but suffers from poor generalization under distribution shifts. We demonstrate that brute-force data scaling is ineffective for out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness; efficiency and coverage are the true bottlenecks. To address this, we introduce WiCompass, a coverage-aware data-collection framework. WiCompass leverages large-scale motion-capture corpora to build a universal pose space ``oracle'' that quantifies dataset redundancy and identifies underrepresented motions. Guided by this oracle, WiCompass employs a closed-loop policy to prioritize collecting informative missing samples. Experiments show that WiCompass consistently improves OOD accuracy at matched budgets and exhibits superior scaling behavior compared to conventional collection strategies. By shifting focus from brute-force scaling to coverage-aware data acquisition, this work offers a practical path toward robust mmWave sensing.

TL;DR: MiSCHiEF benchmarks reveal persistent modality misalignment in VLMs, emphasizing the challenges in fine-grained image-caption alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained image-caption alignment is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs), especially in socially critical contexts.

Method: We present MiSCHiEF, a set of two benchmarking datasets based on a contrastive pair design in the domains of safety (MiS) and culture (MiC), and evaluate four VLMs on tasks requiring fine-grained differentiation of paired images and captions.

Result: Models generally perform better at confirming the correct image-caption pair than rejecting incorrect ones. Models achieve higher accuracy when selecting the correct caption from two highly similar captions for a given image. Persistent modality misalignment challenges in current VLMs are highlighted.

Conclusion: The results highlight persistent modality misalignment challenges in current VLMs, underscoring the difficulty of precise cross-modal grounding required for applications with subtle semantic and visual distinctions.

Abstract: Fine-grained image-caption alignment is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs), especially in socially critical contexts such as identifying real-world risk scenarios or distinguishing cultural proxies, where correct interpretation hinges on subtle visual or linguistic clues and where minor misinterpretations can lead to significant real-world consequences. We present MiSCHiEF, a set of two benchmarking datasets based on a contrastive pair design in the domains of safety (MiS) and culture (MiC), and evaluate four VLMs on tasks requiring fine-grained differentiation of paired images and captions. In both datasets, each sample contains two minimally differing captions and corresponding minimally differing images. In MiS, the image-caption pairs depict a safe and an unsafe scenario, while in MiC, they depict cultural proxies in two distinct cultural contexts. We find that models generally perform better at confirming the correct image-caption pair than rejecting incorrect ones. Additionally, models achieve higher accuracy when selecting the correct caption from two highly similar captions for a given image, compared to the converse task. The results, overall, highlight persistent modality misalignment challenges in current VLMs, underscoring the difficulty of precise cross-modal grounding required for applications with subtle semantic and visual distinctions.

Abstract: This paper introduces LaS-Comp, a zero-shot and category-agnostic approach that leverages the rich geometric priors of 3D foundation models to enable 3D shape completion across diverse types of partial observations. Our contributions are threefold: First, \ourname{} harnesses these powerful generative priors for completion through a complementary two-stage design: (i) an explicit replacement stage that preserves the partial observation geometry to ensure faithful completion; and (ii) an implicit refinement stage ensures seamless boundaries between the observed and synthesized regions. Second, our framework is training-free and compatible with different 3D foundation models. Third, we introduce Omni-Comp, a comprehensive benchmark combining real-world and synthetic data with diverse and challenging partial patterns, enabling a more thorough and realistic evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态几何推理需要模型同时理解视觉图和执行结构化符号推理，但当前视觉-语言模型由于训练数据有限和视觉-符号对齐较弱，在复杂几何构造上存在困难。

Method: 提出了一种从零开始合成复杂多模态几何问题的管道，并构建了一个名为GeoCode的数据集。该数据集将问题生成分解为符号种子构建、基于验证的实例化以及基于代码的图渲染，确保在结构、文本、推理和图像之间的一致性。利用GeoCode中提供的绘图代码，进一步引入代码预测作为显式的对齐目标，将视觉理解转化为监督结构化预测任务。

Result: GeoCode在结构复杂性和推理难度方面显著高于现有基准，并通过多阶段验证保持数学正确性。大量实验表明，在GeoCode上训练的模型在多个几何基准测试上实现了持续改进，证明了数据集和所提出对齐策略的有效性。

Conclusion: GeoCode数据集和所提出的方法在多模态几何推理方面取得了显著成果。

Abstract: Multimodal geometry reasoning requires models to jointly understand visual diagrams and perform structured symbolic inference, yet current vision--language models struggle with complex geometric constructions due to limited training data and weak visual--symbolic alignment. We propose a pipeline for synthesizing complex multimodal geometry problems from scratch and construct a dataset named \textbf{GeoCode}, which decouples problem generation into symbolic seed construction, grounded instantiation with verification, and code-based diagram rendering, ensuring consistency across structure, text, reasoning, and images. Leveraging the plotting code provided in GeoCode, we further introduce code prediction as an explicit alignment objective, transforming visual understanding into a supervised structured prediction task. GeoCode exhibits substantially higher structural complexity and reasoning difficulty than existing benchmarks, while maintaining mathematical correctness through multi-stage validation. Extensive experiments show that models trained on GeoCode achieve consistent improvements on multiple geometry benchmarks, demonstrating both the effectiveness of the dataset and the proposed alignment strategy.

TL;DR: MIRROR框架通过视觉反思和多模态迭代推理提高了视觉-语言模型的正确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视觉-语言模型（VLMs）时代，增强多模态推理能力仍然是一个关键挑战，特别是在处理模糊或复杂的视觉输入时，初始推理往往导致幻觉或逻辑错误。

Method: 提出MIRROR框架，通过在视觉区域进行反思来执行多模态迭代推理。该框架包括草案、批评、基于区域的验证和修订等步骤，直到输出在视觉上得到证实。构建ReflectV数据集以促进模型的训练，该数据集包含反思触发器、基于区域的验证操作和基于视觉证据的答案修订。

Result: 在通用视觉-语言基准和代表性的视觉-语言推理基准上的实验表明，MIRROR提高了正确性并减少了视觉幻觉，证明了将反思作为寻求证据、区域感知验证过程的价值，而不是纯粹的文本修订步骤。

Conclusion: MIRROR框架通过视觉反思增强了多模态推理能力，有效减少了幻觉和错误，提高了推理的正确性。

Abstract: In the era of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), enhancing multimodal reasoning capabilities remains a critical challenge, particularly in handling ambiguous or complex visual inputs, where initial inferences often lead to hallucinations or logic errors. Existing VLMs often produce plausible yet ungrounded answers, and even when prompted to "reflect", their corrections may remain detached from the image evidence. To address this, we propose the MIRROR framework for Multimodal Iterative Reasoning via Reflection On visual Regions. By embedding visual reflection as a core mechanism, MIRROR is formulated as a closed-loop process comprising draft, critique, region-based verification, and revision, which are repeated until the output is visually grounded. To facilitate training of this model, we construct **ReflectV**, a visual reflective dataset for multi-turn supervision that explicitly contains reflection triggers, region-based verification actions, and answer revision grounded in visual evidence. Experiments on both general vision-language benchmarks and representative vision-language reasoning benchmarks show that MIRROR improves correctness and reduces visual hallucinations, demonstrating the value of training reflection as an evidence-seeking, region-aware verification process rather than a purely textual revision step.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于基础模型的组织病理学像素级语义分割评估方法，集成模型表现优于单个模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，基础模型如CLIP、DINO和CONCH在图像任务中表现出显著的领域泛化和无监督特征提取能力。然而，对于组织病理学中像素级语义分割的系统性独立评估却很少。

Method: 提出了一种稳健的基准评估方法，评估了10个基础模型在四个组织病理学数据集上的表现，这些数据集涵盖了组织形态学区域分割和细胞/核分割任务。利用基础模型的关注图作为像素级特征，然后使用机器学习算法XGBoost进行分类，实现快速、可解释且无需微调的模型无关评估。

Result: CONCH在所有数据集中优于仅视觉基础模型，PathDino紧随其后。进一步分析表明，在独特的组织病理学队列上训练的模型捕获了互补的形态学表示，它们的特征拼接产生了更好的分割性能。CONCH、PathDino和CellViT的特征拼接在所有数据集中优于单个模型，平均提高了7.95%，表明基础模型的集成可以更好地泛化到各种组织病理学分割任务中。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种基于基础模型的组织病理学像素级语义分割评估方法，表明模型集成可以显著提高分割性能。

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models such as CLIP, DINO,and CONCH have demonstrated remarkable domain generalization and unsupervised feature extraction capabilities across diverse imaging tasks. However, systematic and independent evaluations of these models for pixel-level semantic segmentation in histopathology remain scarce. In this study, we propose a robust benchmarking approach to asses 10 foundational models on four histopathological datasets covering both morphological tissue-region and cellular/nuclear segmentation tasks. Our method leverages attention maps of foundation models as pixel-wise features, which are then classified using a machine learning algorithm, XGBoost, enabling fast, interpretable, and model-agnostic evaluation without finetuning. We show that the vision language foundation model, CONCH performed the best across datasets when compared to vision-only foundation models, with PathDino as close second. Further analysis shows that models trained on distinct histopathology cohorts capture complementary morphological representations, and concatenating their features yields superior segmentation performance. Concatenating features from CONCH, PathDino and CellViT outperformed individual models across all the datasets by 7.95% (averaged across the datasets), suggesting that ensembles of foundation models can better generalize to diverse histopathological segmentation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了EditedID框架，解决了面部身份编辑中的一致性问题，为实际应用提供了可靠的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实肖像编辑中，多模态编辑大型模型在编辑能力方面表现出强大的能力，但长期存在的一个问题是面部身份（ID）一致性下降。由于人眼对面部特征的高度敏感性，这种不一致性显著阻碍了这些模型的实际部署。现有的面部ID保留方法由于跨源分布偏差和跨源特征污染，难以实现面部身份和编辑元素IP的一致性恢复。

Method: 提出了一种名为EditedID的Alignment-Disentanglement-Entanglement框架，该框架通过系统地分析扩散轨迹、采样器行为和注意力属性，引入了三个关键组件：1）自适应混合策略，在整个扩散过程中对齐跨源潜在表示；2）混合求解器，解耦源特定的身份属性和细节；3）注意力门控机制，选择性地纠缠视觉元素。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，EditedID在保留原始面部ID和编辑元素IP一致性方面取得了最先进的性能。作为一种无需训练和即插即用的解决方案，它为开放世界中单/多个人脸身份恢复设定了新的基准，为多模态编辑大型模型在真实人物编辑场景中的部署铺平了道路。

Conclusion: EditedID框架在面部身份编辑方面取得了显著的成果，为实际应用提供了可靠的方法。

Abstract: Multimodal editing large models have demonstrated powerful editing capabilities across diverse tasks. However, a persistent and long-standing limitation is the decline in facial identity (ID) consistency during realistic portrait editing. Due to the human eye's high sensitivity to facial features, such inconsistency significantly hinders the practical deployment of these models. Current facial ID preservation methods struggle to achieve consistent restoration of both facial identity and edited element IP due to Cross-source Distribution Bias and Cross-source Feature Contamination. To address these issues, we propose EditedID, an Alignment-Disentanglement-Entanglement framework for robust identity-specific facial restoration. By systematically analyzing diffusion trajectories, sampler behaviors, and attention properties, we introduce three key components: 1) Adaptive mixing strategy that aligns cross-source latent representations throughout the diffusion process. 2) Hybrid solver that disentangles source-specific identity attributes and details. 3) Attentional gating mechanism that selectively entangles visual elements. Extensive experiments show that EditedID achieves state-of-the-art performance in preserving original facial ID and edited element IP consistency. As a training-free and plug-and-play solution, it establishes a new benchmark for practical and reliable single/multi-person facial identity restoration in open-world settings, paving the way for the deployment of multimodal editing large models in real-person editing scenarios.

Abstract: Human driving behavior is inherently diverse, yet most end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) systems learn a single average driving style, neglecting individual differences. Achieving personalized E2E-AD faces challenges across three levels: limited real-world datasets with individual-level annotations, a lack of quantitative metrics for evaluating personal driving styles, and the absence of algorithms that can learn stylized representations from users' trajectories. To address these gaps, we propose Person2Drive, a comprehensive personalized E2E-AD platform and benchmark. It includes an open-source, flexible data collection system that simulates realistic scenarios to generate scalable and diverse personalized driving datasets; style vector-based evaluation metrics with Maximum Mean Discrepancy and KL divergence to comprehensively quantify individual driving behaviors; and a personalized E2E-AD framework with a style reward model that efficiently adapts E2E models for safe and individualized driving. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Person2Drive enables fine-grained analysis, reproducible evaluation, and effective personalization in end-to-end autonomous driving. Our dataset and code will be released after acceptance.

Conclusion: TAG模型通过结构化的有依据的中间表示，提高了面部表情识别中的多模态推理的可靠性。

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is a fine-grained visual understanding task where reliable predictions require reasoning over localized and meaningful facial cues. Recent vision--language models (VLMs) enable natural language explanations for FER, but their reasoning is often ungrounded, producing fluent yet unverifiable rationales that are weakly tied to visual evidence and prone to hallucination, leading to poor robustness across different datasets. We propose TAG (Thinking with Action Unit Grounding), a vision--language framework that explicitly constrains multimodal reasoning to be supported by facial Action Units (AUs). TAG requires intermediate reasoning steps to be grounded in AU-related facial regions, yielding predictions accompanied by verifiable visual evidence. The model is trained via supervised fine-tuning on AU-grounded reasoning traces followed by reinforcement learning with an AU-aware reward that aligns predicted regions with external AU detectors. Evaluated on RAF-DB, FERPlus, and AffectNet, TAG consistently outperforms strong open-source and closed-source VLM baselines while simultaneously improving visual faithfulness. Ablation and preference studies further show that AU-grounded rewards stabilize reasoning and mitigate hallucination, demonstrating the importance of structured grounded intermediate representations for trustworthy multimodal reasoning in FER.

Abstract: Urban Villages (UVs) represent a distinctive form of high-density informal settlement embedded within China's rapidly urbanizing cities. Accurate identification of UVs is critical for urban governance, renewal, and sustainable development. But due to the pronounced heterogeneity and diversity of UVs across China's vast territory, a consistent and reliable nationwide dataset has been lacking. In this work, we present GeoLink-UV, a high-resolution nationwide UV mapping product that clearly delineates the locations and boundaries of UVs in 342 Chinese cities. The dataset is derived from multisource geospatial data, including optical remote sensing images and geo-vector data, and is generated through a foundation model-driven mapping framework designed to address the generalization issues and improve the product quality. A geographically stratified accuracy assessment based on independent samples from 28 cities confirms the reliability and scientific credibility of the nationwide dataset across heterogeneous urban contexts. Based on this nationwide product, we reveal substantial interregional disparities in UV prevalence and spatial configuration. On average, UV areas account for 8 % of built-up land, with marked clustering in central and south China. Building-level analysis further confirms a consistent low-rise, high-density development pattern of UVs nationwide, while highlighting regionally differentiated morphological characteristics. The GeoLink-UV dataset provides an open and systematically validated geospatial foundation for urban studies, informal settlement monitoring, and evidence-based urban renewal planning, and contributes directly to large-scale assessments aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 11. The GeoLink-UV dataset introduced in this article is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18688062.

Abstract: Age estimation systems are increasingly deployed as gatekeepers for age-restricted online content, yet their robustness to cosmetic modifications has not been systematically evaluated. We investigate whether simple, household-accessible cosmetic changes, including beards, grey hair, makeup, and simulated wrinkles, can cause AI age estimators to classify minors as adults. To study this threat at scale without ethical concerns, we simulate these physical attacks on 329 facial images of individuals aged 10 to 21 using a VLM image editor (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image). We then evaluate eight models from our prior benchmark: five specialized architectures (MiVOLO, Custom-Best, Herosan, MiViaLab, DEX) and three vision-language models (Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Flash, GPT-5-Nano). We introduce the Attack Conversion Rate (ACR), defined as the fraction of images predicted as minor at baseline that flip to adult after attack, a population-agnostic metric that does not depend on the ratio of minors to adults in the test set. Our results reveal that a synthetic beard alone achieves 28 to 69 percent ACR across all eight models; combining all four attacks shifts predicted age by +7.7 years on average across all 329 subjects and reaches up to 83 percent ACR; and vision-language models exhibit lower ACR (59 to 71 percent) than specialized models (63 to 83 percent) under the full attack, although the ACR ranges overlap and the difference is not statistically tested. These findings highlight a critical vulnerability in deployed age-verification pipelines and call for adversarial robustness evaluation as a mandatory criterion for model selection.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLM) pre-trained on datasets of histopathological image-caption pairs enabled zero-shot slide-level classification. The ability of VLM image encoders to extract discriminative features also opens the door for supervised fine-tuning for whole-slide image (WSI) classification, ideally using few labeled samples. Slide-level prediction frameworks require the incorporation of multiple instance learning (MIL) due to the gigapixel size of the WSI. Following patch-level feature extraction and aggregation, MIL frameworks rely on linear classifiers trained on top of the slide-level aggregated features. Classifier weight initialization has a large influence on Linear Probing performance in efficient transfer learning (ETL) approaches based on few-shot learning. In this work, we propose Zero-Shot Multiple-Instance Learning (ZS-MIL) to address the limitations of random classifier initialization that underperform zero-shot prediction in MIL problems. ZS-MIL uses the class-level embeddings of the VLM text encoder as the classification layer's starting point to compute each sample's bag-level probabilities. Through multiple experiments, we demonstrate the robustness of ZS-MIL compared to well-known weight initialization techniques both in terms of performance and variability in an ETL few-shot scenario for subtyping prediction.

Motivation: 为了解决现有基于扩散的逆事实生成方法的计算成本高、采样慢和局部定位不精确等问题。

Method: 提出MaskDiME，一个简单、快速、有效的扩散框架，通过局部采样统一语义一致性和空间精度。

Result: MaskDiME在五个基准数据集上实现了超过30倍的推理速度提升，并在多个视觉领域取得了可比或最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MaskDiME为高效的逆事实解释提供了一个实用且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual counterfactual explanations aim to reveal the minimal semantic modifications that can alter a model's prediction, providing causal and interpretable insights into deep neural networks. However, existing diffusion-based counterfactual generation methods are often computationally expensive, slow to sample, and imprecise in localizing the modified regions. To address these limitations, we propose MaskDiME, a simple, fast, and effective diffusion framework that unifies semantic consistency and spatial precision through localized sampling. Our approach adaptively focuses on decision-relevant regions to achieve localized and semantically consistent counterfactual generation while preserving high image fidelity. Our training-free framework, MaskDiME, achieves over 30x faster inference than the baseline method and achieves comparable or state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets spanning diverse visual domains, establishing a practical and generalizable solution for efficient counterfactual explanation.

Motivation: 对齐大规模文本到图像扩散模型与细微的人类偏好具有挑战性。直接偏好优化虽然简单有效，但大规模微调通常存在泛化差距。

Method: 将偏好对齐作为无分类器指导（CFG）来处理：微调的偏好模型在采样过程中作为外部控制信号。将偏好学习分为两个模块分别训练在正负数据上，形成对比指导向量，并在推理时通过减去它们的预测（正减负）来实现。

Conclusion: 提出了一种简单的方法，在不重新训练基模型的情况下提高对齐度，并通过对比指导实现了更精确和可控的信号。

Abstract: Aligning large-scale text-to-image diffusion models with nuanced human preferences remains challenging. While direct preference optimization (DPO) is simple and effective, large-scale finetuning often shows a generalization gap. We take inspiration from test-time guidance and cast preference alignment as classifier-free guidance (CFG): a finetuned preference model acts as an external control signal during sampling. Building on this view, we propose a simple method that improves alignment without retraining the base model. To further enhance generalization, we decouple preference learning into two modules trained on positive and negative data, respectively, and form a \emph{contrastive guidance} vector at inference by subtracting their predictions (positive minus negative), scaled by a user-chosen strength and added to the base prediction at each step. This yields a sharper and controllable alignment signal. We evaluate on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and Stable Diffusion XL with Pick-a-Pic v2 and HPDv3, showing consistent quantitative and qualitative gains.

Motivation: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD) aims to detect novel classes in unseen target domains given only a few labeled examples.

Method: Proposes a dual-branch detector that Learns Multi-modal Prototypes (LMP) by coupling textual guidance with visual exemplars.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive mAP on six cross-domain benchmark datasets and standard 1/5/10-shot settings.

Conclusion: The proposed LMP method effectively improves few-shot object detection performance in cross-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD) aims to detect novel classes in unseen target domains given only a few labeled examples. While open-vocabulary detectors built on vision-language models (VLMs) transfer well, they depend almost entirely on text prompts, which encode domain-invariant semantics but miss domain-specific visual information needed for precise localization under few-shot supervision. We propose a dual-branch detector that Learns Multi-modal Prototypes, dubbed LMP, by coupling textual guidance with visual exemplars drawn from the target domain. A Visual Prototype Construction module aggregates class-level prototypes from support RoIs and dynamically generates hard-negative prototypes in query images via jittered boxes, capturing distractors and visually similar backgrounds. In the visual-guided branch, we inject these prototypes into the detection pipeline with components mirrored from the text branch as the starting point for training, while a parallel text-guided branch preserves open-vocabulary semantics. The branches are trained jointly and ensembled at inference by combining semantic abstraction with domain-adaptive details. On six cross-domain benchmark datasets and standard 1/5/10-shot settings, our method achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive mAP.

Motivation: 针对现实世界中的跨模态超分辨率问题，数据存在空间错位，且只有少量低分辨率源图像和高分辨率引导图像对可用。

Method: 提出RobSelf模型，该模型是一种完全自监督的模型，在线优化，无需训练数据、真实标签监督或预对齐。模型包括两个关键技术：一个错位感知特征转换器和一个内容感知参考滤波器。

Result: 在多个任务中，RobSelf实现了最先进的性能和更高的效率。同时，引入了RealMisSR真实世界数据集，以推进该领域的研究。

Conclusion: RobSelf在跨模态超分辨率任务中表现出色，为解决现实世界中的数据错位问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: We study cross-modal super-resolution (SR) on real-world misaligned data, where only a limited number of low-resolution (LR) source and high-resolution (HR) guide image pairs with complex spatial misalignments are available. To address this challenge, we propose RobSelf--a fully self-supervised model that is optimized online, requiring no training data, ground-truth supervision, or pre-alignment. RobSelf features two key techniques: a misalignment-aware feature translator and a content-aware reference filter. The translator reformulates unsupervised cross-modal and cross-resolution alignment as a weakly-supervised, misalignment-aware translation subtask, producing an aligned guide feature with inherent redundancy. Guided by this feature, the filter performs reference-based discriminative self-enhancement on the source, enabling SR predictions with high resolution and high fidelity. Across a variety of tasks, we demonstrate that RobSelf achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior efficiency. Additionally, we introduce a real-world dataset, RealMisSR, to advance research on this topic. Dataset and code: https://github.com/palmdong/RobSelf.

TL;DR: 4DSTAR is a novel model for generating spatial-temporal consistent 4D objects with competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods often struggle with spatial-temporal inconsistency, as they fail to leverage outputs from all previous timesteps to guide the generation at the current timestep.

Method: Proposes a Spatial-Temporal State Propagation AutoRegressive Model (4DSTAR) to generate 4D objects maintaining temporal-spatial consistency. The model consists of two key components: a dynamic spatial-temporal state propagation autoregressive model (STAR) and a 4D VQ-VAE.

Result: 4DSTAR generates spatial-temporal consistent 4D objects and achieves performance competitive with diffusion models.

Conclusion: The proposed 4DSTAR model effectively addresses the spatial-temporal inconsistency problem in 4D object generation, demonstrating competitive performance compared to existing diffusion-based methods.

Abstract: Generating high-quality 4D objects with spatial-temporal consistency is still formidable. Existing diffusion-based methods often struggle with spatial-temporal inconsistency, as they fail to leverage outputs from all previous timesteps to guide the generation at the current timestep. Therefore, we propose a Spatial-Temporal State Propagation AutoRegressive Model (4DSTAR), which generates 4D objects maintaining temporal-spatial consistency. 4DSTAR formulates the generation problem as the prediction of tokens that represent the 4D object. It consists of two key components: (1) The dynamic spatial-temporal state propagation autoregressive model (STAR) is proposed, which achieves spatial-temporal consistent generation. Unlike standard autoregressive models, STAR divides prediction tokens into groups based on timesteps. It models long-term dependencies by propagating spatial-temporal states from previous groups and utilizes these dependencies to guide generation at the next timestep. To this end, a spatial-temporal container is proposed, which dynamically updating the effective spatial-temporal state features from all historical groups, then updated features serve as conditional features to guide the prediction of the next token group. (2) The 4D VQ-VAE is proposed, which implicitly encodes the 4D structure into discrete space and decodes the discrete tokens predicted by STAR into temporally coherent dynamic 3D Gaussians. Experiments demonstrate that 4DSTAR generates spatial-temporal consistent 4D objects, and achieves performance competitive with diffusion models.

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a practical alternative to authentic face datasets for training face recognition (FR) systems, especially as privacy and legal concerns increasingly restrict the use of real biometric data. Recent advances in identity-conditional diffusion models have enabled the generation of photorealistic and identity-consistent face images. However, many of these models suffer from limited intra-class variation, an essential property for training robust and generalizable FR models. In this work, we propose IDPERTURB, a simple yet effective geometric-driven sampling strategy to enhance diversity in synthetic face generation. IDPERTURB perturbs identity embeddings within a constrained angular region of the unit hyper-sphere, producing a diverse set of embeddings without modifying the underlying generative model. Each perturbed embedding serves as a conditioning vector for a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling the synthesis of visually varied yet identity-coherent face images suitable for training generalizable FR systems. Empirical results demonstrate that training FR on datasets generated using IDPERTURB yields improved performance across multiple FR benchmarks, compared to existing synthetic data generation approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于叶子的细微变化，传统的机器学习模型可能无法捕捉和解释植物健康、生长和疾病中的判别特征，导致在现实场景下识别植物疾病、严重程度分级和营养缺乏预测变得更具挑战性。

Method: 提出了一种轻量级的自动编码器，使用可分离卷积层在编码器-解码器块中，并应用sigmoid门控来提高编码器的特征判别能力，解码器进一步改进。最后，将编码器-解码器的特征图组合以获得丰富的特征表示，在分类前进行结合。

Conclusion: CLAP（植物疾病分类的卷积轻量级自动编码器）在现实场景下对植物疾病的识别和分类方面表现出色，具有较高的准确率和较低的计算成本。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks have remarkably progressed the performance of distinguishing plant diseases, severity grading, and nutrition deficiency prediction using leaf images. However, these tasks become more challenging in a realistic in-situ field condition. Often, a traditional machine learning model may fail to capture and interpret discriminative characteristics of plant health, growth and diseases due to subtle variations within leaf subcategories. A few deep learning methods have used additional preprocessing stages or network modules to address the problem, whereas several other methods have utilized pre-trained backbone CNNs, most of which are computationally intensive. Therefore, to address the challenge, we propose a lightweight autoencoder using separable convolutional layers in its encoder decoder blocks. A sigmoid gating is applied for refining the prowess of the encoders feature discriminability, which is improved further by the decoder. Finally, the feature maps of the encoder decoder are combined for rich feature representation before classification. The proposed Convolutional Lightweight Autoencoder for Plant disease classification, called CLAP, has been experimented on three public plant datasets consisting of cassava, tomato, maize, groundnut, grapes, etc. for determining plant health conditions. The CLAP has attained improved or competitive accuracies on the Integrated Plant Disease, Groundnut, and CCMT datasets balancing a tradeoff between the performance, and little computational cost requiring 5 million parameters. The training time is 20 milliseconds and inference time is 1 ms per image.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）的快速部署和广泛应用，引发了对模型版本归属和所有权的争议，对知识产权保护提出了重大挑战。

Method: 提出一个框架来生成MLLMs的版权触发器，允许模型发布者将可验证的所有权信息嵌入到模型中。通过构建触发图像，只在高精调的原始模型衍生品中激发所有权相关的文本响应，而在其他非衍生模型中保持惰性。使用对抗性优化，双重注入所有权相关的语义信息。第一个注入是通过强制辅助MLLM的输出与预定义的所有权相关目标文本之间的文本一致性实现的；一致性损失被反向传播以将所有权相关信息注入图像。第二个注入在语义级别通过最小化图像的CLIP特征与目标文本的特征之间的距离来完成。此外，还引入了一个涉及原始模型本身的辅助模型的对抗性训练阶段。这个辅助模型专门训练以抵抗生成所有权相关的目标文本，从而增强在高度精调的衍生模型中的鲁棒性。

Result: 大量实验证明了我们的双重注入方法在各种微调和领域迁移场景下跟踪模型血统的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法可以有效地跟踪MLLMs的所有权信息，有助于保护知识产权。

Abstract: With the rapid deployment and widespread adoption of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), disputes regarding model version attribution and ownership have become increasingly frequent, raising significant concerns about intellectual property protection. In this paper, we propose a framework for generating copyright triggers for MLLMs, enabling model publishers to embed verifiable ownership information into the model. The goal is to construct trigger images that elicit ownership-related textual responses exclusively in fine-tuned derivatives of the original model, while remaining inert in other non-derivative models. Our method constructs a tracking trigger image by treating the image as a learnable tensor, performing adversarial optimization with dual-injection of ownership-relevant semantic information. The first injection is achieved by enforcing textual consistency between the output of an auxiliary MLLM and a predefined ownership-relevant target text; the consistency loss is backpropagated to inject this ownership-related information into the image. The second injection is performed at the semantic-level by minimizing the distance between the CLIP features of the image and those of the target text. Furthermore, we introduce an additional adversarial training stage involving the auxiliary model derived from the original model itself. This auxiliary model is specifically trained to resist generating ownership-relevant target text, thereby enhancing robustness in heavily fine-tuned derivative models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dual-injection approach in tracking model lineage under various fine-tuning and domain-shift scenarios.

Conclusion: DUET-VLM在多个基准测试中超越了之前的最先进视觉标记减少方法，能够在减少视觉输入的情况下保持精度，生成紧凑且语义丰富的表示。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities, yet remain computationally expensive due to dense visual tokenization. Existing efficiency approaches either merge redundant visual tokens or drop them progressively in language backbone, often trading accuracy for speed. In this work, we propose DUET-VLM, a versatile plug-and-play dual compression framework that consists of (a) vision-only redundancy aware compression of vision encoder's output into information-preserving tokens, followed by (b) layer-wise, salient text-guided dropping of visual tokens within the language backbone to progressively prune less informative tokens. This coordinated token management enables aggressive compression while retaining critical semantics. On LLaVA-1.5-7B, our approach maintains over 99% of baseline accuracy with 67% fewer tokens, and still retains >97% even at 89% reduction. With this dual-stage compression during training, it achieves 99.7% accuracy at 67% and 97.6% at 89%, surpassing prior SoTA visual token reduction methods across multiple benchmarks. When integrated into Video-LLaVA-7B, it even surpasses the baseline -- achieving >100% accuracy with a substantial 53.1% token reduction and retaining 97.6% accuracy under an extreme 93.4% setting. These results highlight end-to-end training with DUET-VLM, enabling robust adaptation to reduced visual (image/video) input without sacrificing accuracy, producing compact yet semantically rich representations within the same computational budget.

Conclusion: OVDG-SS and S2-Corr improve the robustness of OV-SS models in unseen environments, particularly in urban-driving scenarios.

Abstract: Domain Generalization in Semantic Segmentation (DG-SS) aims to enable segmentation models to perform robustly in unseen environments. However, conventional DG-SS methods are restricted to a fixed set of known categories, limiting their applicability in open-world scenarios. Recent progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has advanced Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OV-SS) by enabling models to recognize a broader range of concepts. Yet, these models remain sensitive to domain shifts and struggle to maintain robustness when deployed in unseen environments, a challenge that is particularly severe in urban-driving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Open-Vocabulary Domain Generalization in Semantic Segmentation (OVDG-SS), a new setting that jointly addresses unseen domains and unseen categories. We introduce the first benchmark for OVDG-SS in autonomous driving, addressing a previously unexplored problem and covering both synthetic-to-real and real-to-real generalization across diverse unseen domains and unseen categories. In OVDG-SS, we observe that domain shifts often distort text-image correlations in pre-trained VLMs, which hinders the performance of OV-SS models. To tackle this challenge, we propose S2-Corr, a state-space-driven text-image correlation refinement mechanism that mitigates domain-induced distortions and produces more consistent text-image correlations under distribution changes. Extensive experiments on our constructed benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior cross-domain performance and efficiency compared to existing OV-SS approaches.

Abstract: We present a framework for end-to-end joint quantization of Vision Transformers trained on ImageNet for the purpose of image classification. Unlike prior post-training or block-wise reconstruction methods, we jointly optimize over the entire set of all layers and inter-block dependencies without any labeled data, scaling effectively with the number of samples and completing in just one hour on a single GPU for ViT-small. We achieve state-of-the-art W4A4 and W3A3 accuracies on ImageNet and, to the best of our knowledge, the first PTQ results that maintain strong accuracy on ViT, DeiT, and Swin-T models under extremely low-bit settings (W1.58A8), demonstrating the potential for efficient edge deployment. Furthermore, we introduce a data-free calibration strategy that synthesizes diverse, label-free samples using Stable Diffusion Turbo guided by learned multi-mode prompts. By encouraging diversity in both the learned prompt embeddings and the generated image features, our data-free approach achieves performance on par with real-data ImageNet calibration and surpasses simple text-prompt baselines such as "a <adjective> photo of <adjective> <cls>".

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR point clouds is important in urban remote sensing for understanding real-world street environments. This task, by projecting LiDAR point clouds and 3D semantic labels as sparse maps, can be reformulated as a 2D problem. However, the intrinsic sparsity of the projected LiDAR and label maps can result in sparse and inaccurate intermediate 2D semantic predictions, which in return limits the final 3D accuracy. To address this issue, we enhance this task by shaping dense and accurate 2D predictions. Specifically, we develop a multi-modal segmentation model, MM2D3D. By leveraging camera images as auxiliary data, we introduce cross-modal guided filtering to overcome label map sparsity by constraining intermediate 2D semantic predictions with dense semantic relations derived from the camera images; and we introduce dynamic cross pseudo supervision to overcome LiDAR map sparsity by encouraging the 2D predictions to emulate the dense distribution of the semantic predictions from the camera images. Experiments show that our techniques enable our model to achieve intermediate 2D semantic predictions with dense distribution and higher accuracy, which effectively enhances the final 3D accuracy. Comparisons with previous methods demonstrate our superior performance in both 2D and 3D spaces.

Abstract: Text-guided dynamic 3D character generation has advanced rapidly, yet producing high-quality motion that faithfully reflects rich textual descriptions remains challenging. Existing methods tend to generate limited sub-actions or incoherent motion due to fixed-length temporal inputs and discrete frame-wise representations that fail to capture rich motion semantics. We address these limitations by representing motion with continuous differentiable B-spline curves, enabling more effective motion generation without modifying the capabilities of the underlying generative model. Specifically, our closed-form, Laplacian-regularized B-spline solver efficiently compresses variable-length motion sequences into compact representations with a fixed number of control points. Further, we introduce a normal-fusion strategy for input shape adherence along with correspondence-aware and local-rigidity losses for motion-restoration quality. To train our model, we collate BIMO, a new dataset containing diverse variable-length 3D motion sequences with rich, high-quality text annotations. Extensive evaluations show that our feed-forward framework BiMotion generates more expressive, higher-quality, and better prompt-aligned motions than existing state-of-the-art methods, while also achieving faster generation.

Motivation: 为了解决现有方法在内容渲染和风格迁移方面的不足，提出了一种新的字体生成模型。

Method: 提出了一种结构级解耦扩散模型（SLD-Font），通过两个独立的通道接收内容和风格信息，并结合交叉注意力机制和背景噪声消除模块。

Result: 实验结果表明，SLD-Font在保持内容准确性的同时，实现了更高的风格保真度。

Conclusion: SLD-Font是一种有效的字体生成模型，在内容渲染和风格迁移方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Few-shot Chinese font generation aims to synthesize new characters in a target style using only a handful of reference images. Achieving accurate content rendering and faithful style transfer requires effective disentanglement between content and style. However, existing approaches achieve only feature-level disentanglement, allowing the generator to re-entangle these features, leading to content distortion and degraded style fidelity. We propose the Structure-Level Disentangled Diffusion Model (SLD-Font), which receives content and style information from two separate channels. SimSun-style images are used as content templates and concatenated with noisy latent features as the input. Style features extracted by a CLIP model from target-style images are integrated via cross-attention. Additionally, we train a Background Noise Removal module in the pixel space to remove background noise in complex stroke regions. Based on theoretical validation of disentanglement effectiveness, we introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that updates only the style-related modules. This allows the model to better adapt to new styles while avoiding overfitting to the reference images' content. We further introduce the Grey and OCR metrics to evaluate the content quality of generated characters. Experimental results show that SLD-Font achieves significantly higher style fidelity while maintaining comparable content accuracy to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Advances in image tampering techniques, particularly generative models, pose significant challenges to media verification, digital forensics, and public trust. Existing image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) methods suffer from two key limitations: over-reliance on semantic content while neglecting textural cues, and limited interpretability of subtle low-level tampering traces. To address these issues, we propose FOCA, a multimodal large language model-based framework that integrates discriminative features from both the RGB spatial and frequency domains via a cross-attention fusion module. This design enables accurate forgery detection and localization while providing explicit, human-interpretable cross-domain explanations. We further introduce FSE-Set, a large-scale dataset with diverse authentic and tampered images, pixel-level masks, and dual-domain annotations. Extensive experiments show that FOCA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection performance and interpretability across both spatial and frequency domains.

TL;DR: SceneTok：一种高效场景编码与生成方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有3D场景表示和生成方法使用3D数据结构或视对齐字段的问题，提出了一种新的方法。

Method: 使用多视角标记器将场景信息编码为小集排列不变标记，并通过轻量级校正流解码器渲染到新视图中。

Result: 压缩比达到1-3个数量级，同时达到最先进的重建质量。可以渲染出新颖的轨迹，包括偏离输入轨迹的轨迹。5秒内即可生成场景，实现了比以前范式更好的质量-速度权衡。

Conclusion: SceneTok是一种新的场景编码方法，能够以高压缩比和良好的重建质量生成场景。

Abstract: We present SceneTok, a novel tokenizer for encoding view sets of scenes into a compressed and diffusable set of unstructured tokens. Existing approaches for 3D scene representation and generation commonly use 3D data structures or view-aligned fields. In contrast, we introduce the first method that encodes scene information into a small set of permutation-invariant tokens that is disentangled from the spatial grid. The scene tokens are predicted by a multi-view tokenizer given many context views and rendered into novel views by employing a light-weight rectified flow decoder. We show that the compression is 1-3 orders of magnitude stronger than for other representations while still reaching state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. Further, our representation can be rendered from novel trajectories, including ones deviating from the input trajectory, and we show that the decoder gracefully handles uncertainty. Finally, the highly-compressed set of unstructured latent scene tokens enables simple and efficient scene generation in 5 seconds, achieving a much better quality-speed trade-off than previous paradigms.

Abstract: This paper presents SCHEMA (Structured Components for Harmonized Engineered Modular Architecture), a structured prompt engineering methodology specifically developed for Google Gemini 3 Pro Image. Unlike generic prompt guidelines or model-agnostic tips, SCHEMA is an engineered framework built on systematic professional practice encompassing 850 verified API predictions within an estimated corpus of approximately 4,800 generated images, spanning six professional domains: real estate photography, commercial product photography, editorial content, storyboards, commercial campaigns, and information design. The methodology introduces a three-tier progressive system (BASE, MEDIO, AVANZATO) that scales practitioner control from exploratory (approximately 5%) to directive (approximately 95%), a modular label architecture with 7 core and 5 optional structured components, a decision tree with explicit routing rules to alternative tools, and systematically documented model limitations with corresponding workarounds. Key findings include an observed 91% Mandatory compliance rate and 94% Prohibitions compliance rate across 621 structured prompts, a comparative batch consistency test demonstrating substantially higher inter-generation coherence for structured prompts, independent practitioner validation (n=40), and a dedicated Information Design validation demonstrating >95% first-generation compliance for spatial and typographical control across approximately 300 publicly verifiable infographics.

Result: MDE深度图在SfM和相机重定位任务中表现出色，在不同规模的系统中表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MDE在多视图3D视觉中具有巨大的潜力。

Abstract: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) is a fundamental 3D vision task for recovering camera parameters and scene geometry from multi-view images. While recent deep learning advances enable accurate Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) from single images without depending on camera motion, integrating MDE into SfM remains a challenge. Unlike conventional triangulated sparse point clouds, MDE produces dense depth maps with significantly higher error variance. Inspired by modern RANSAC estimators, we propose Marginalized Bundle Adjustment (MBA) to mitigate MDE error variance leveraging its density. With MBA, we show that MDE depth maps are sufficiently accurate to yield SoTA or competitive results in SfM and camera relocalization tasks. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate consistently robust performance across varying scales, ranging from few-frame setups to large multi-view systems with thousands of images. Our method highlights the significant potential of MDE in multi-view 3D vision.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Personalized image generation requires effectively balancing content fidelity with stylistic consistency when synthesizing images based on text and reference examples. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers an efficient personalization approach, with potential for precise control through combining LoRA weights on different concepts. However, existing combination techniques face persistent challenges: entanglement between content and style representations, insufficient guidance for controlling elements' influence, and unstable weight fusion that often require additional training. We address these limitations through CRAFT-LoRA, with complementary components: (1) rank-constrained backbone fine-tuning that injects low-rank projection residuals to encourage learning decoupled content and style subspaces; (2) a prompt-guided approach featuring an expert encoder with specialized branches that enables semantic extension and precise control through selective adapter aggregation; and (3) a training-free, timestep-dependent classifier-free guidance scheme that enhances generation stability by strategically adjusting noise predictions across diffusion steps. Our method significantly improves content-style disentanglement, enables flexible semantic control over LoRA module combinations, and achieves high-fidelity generation without additional retraining overhead.

Motivation: 为了解决现有方法中多智能体协调成本高和单智能体负载过重的问题，提出了DACo架构。

Method: DACo采用全局指挥官进行高级战略规划和局部操作员进行自我中心观察和精细执行，解耦全局推理和局部行动。

Result: 在R2R、REVERIE和R4R数据集上，DACo在零样本设置下相对于最佳基线实现了4.9%、6.5%、5.4%的绝对改进。

Conclusion: DACo提供了一种稳健的长程导航原理和可扩展的范式。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Scene navigation is a fundamental capability for embodied human-AI collaboration, requiring agents to follow natural language instructions to execute coherent action sequences in complex environments. Existing approaches either rely on multiple agents, incurring high coordination and resource costs, or adopt a single-agent paradigm, which overloads the agent with both global planning and local perception, often leading to degraded reasoning and instruction drift in long-horizon settings. To address these issues, we introduce DACo, a planning-grounding decoupled architecture that disentangles global deliberation from local grounding. Concretely, it employs a Global Commander for high-level strategic planning and a Local Operative for egocentric observing and fine-grained execution. By disentangling global reasoning from local action, DACo alleviates cognitive overload and improves long-horizon stability. The framework further integrates dynamic subgoal planning and adaptive replanning to enable structured and resilient navigation. Extensive evaluations on R2R, REVERIE, and R4R demonstrate that DACo achieves 4.9%, 6.5%, 5.4% absolute improvements over the best-performing baselines in zero-shot settings, and generalizes effectively across both closed-source (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source (e.g., Qwen-VL Series) backbones. DACo provides a principled and extensible paradigm for robust long-horizon navigation. Project page: https://github.com/ChocoWu/DACo

Abstract: Real-time hand tracking in trauma surgery is essential for supporting rapid and precise intraoperative decisions. We propose a YOLOv10-based framework that simultaneously localizes hands and classifies their laterality (left or right) in complex surgical scenes. The model is trained on the Trauma THOMPSON Challenge 2025 Task 2 dataset, consisting of first-person surgical videos with annotated hand bounding boxes. Extensive data augmentation and a multi-task detection design improve robustness against motion blur, lighting variations, and diverse hand appearances. Evaluation demonstrates accurate left-hand (67\%) and right-hand (71\%) classification, while distinguishing hands from the background remains challenging. The model achieves an $mAP_{[0.5:0.95]}$ of 0.33 and maintains real-time inference, highlighting its potential for intraoperative deployment. This work establishes a foundation for advanced hand-instrument interaction analysis in emergency surgical procedures.

Conclusion: 深度增强YOLO-SAM2框架在铁路道砟不足检测中表现出更高的可靠性和准确性

Abstract: This paper presents a depth-enhanced YOLO-SAM2 framework for detecting ballast insufficiency in railway tracks using RGB-D data. Although YOLOv8 provides reliable localization, the RGB-only model shows limited safety performance, achieving high precision (0.99) but low recall (0.49) due to insufficient ballast, as it tends to over-predict the sufficient class. To improve reliability, we incorporate depth-based geometric analysis enabled by a sleeper-aligned depth-correction pipeline that compensates for RealSense spatial distortion using polynomial modeling, RANSAC, and temporal smoothing. SAM2 segmentation further refines region-of-interest masks, enabling accurate extraction of sleeper and ballast profiles for geometric classification.
  Experiments on field-collected top-down RGB-D data show that depth-enhanced configurations substantially improve the detection of insufficient ballast. Depending on bounding-box sampling (AABB or RBB) and geometric criteria, recall increases from 0.49 to as high as 0.80, and F1-score improves from 0.66 to over 0.80. These results demonstrate that integrating depth correction with YOLO-SAM2 yields a more robust and reliable approach for automated railway ballast inspection, particularly in visually ambiguous or safety-critical scenarios.

Motivation: 针对时间域适配器在处理中速运动时存在的不足，以及多尺度动态捕捉在细粒度时间分析中的重要性。

Method: 提出Frame2Freq，一种频率感知的适配器，在预训练视觉基础模型（VFMs）的图像到视频转换中进行频谱编码，并学习频率带特定的嵌入，以突出最具判别性的频率范围。

Result: 在五个细粒度活动识别数据集上，Frame2Freq优于先前的PEFT方法，并在四个数据集上甚至超越了全微调模型。

Conclusion: 频率分析方法在图像到视频转换中对时间动态建模是一种强有力的工具。

Abstract: Adapting image-pretrained backbones to video typically relies on time-domain adapters tuned to a single temporal scale. Our experiments show that these modules pick up static image cues and very fast flicker changes, while overlooking medium-speed motion. Capturing dynamics across multiple time-scales is, however, crucial for fine-grained temporal analysis (i.e., opening vs. closing bottle).
  To address this, we introduce Frame2Freq -- a family of frequency-aware adapters that perform spectral encoding during image-to-video adaptation of pretrained Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), improving fine-grained action recognition. Frame2Freq uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) along time and learns frequency-band specific embeddings that adaptively highlight the most discriminative frequency ranges. Across five fine-grained activity recognition datasets, Frame2Freq outperforms prior PEFT methods and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models on four of them. These results provide encouraging evidence that frequency analysis methods are a powerful tool for modeling temporal dynamics in image-to-video transfer.

Method: 提出IDSelect，一种基于强化学习的成本感知选择器，为每个模态和序列选择一个预训练模型以优化准确性-效率权衡

Result: 在CCVID上达到95.9%的Rank-1准确率，计算量比基线低92.4%，在MEVID上计算量降低41.3%，同时保持竞争力

Conclusion: IDSelect在保持高准确率的同时显著提高了效率

Abstract: Video-based person recognition achieves robust identification by integrating face, body, and gait. However, current systems waste computational resources by processing all modalities with fixed heavyweight ensembles regardless of input complexity. To address these limitations, we propose IDSelect, a reinforcement learning-based cost-aware selector that chooses one pre-trained model per modality per-sequence to optimize the accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Our key insight is that an input-conditioned selector can discover complementary model choices that surpass fixed ensembles while using substantially fewer resources. IDSelect trains a lightweight agent end-to-end using actor-critic reinforcement learning with budget-aware optimization. The reward balances recognition accuracy with computational cost, while entropy regularization prevents premature convergence. At inference, the policy selects the most probable model per modality and fuses modality-specific similarities for the final score. Extensive experiments on challenging video-based datasets demonstrate IDSelect's superior efficiency: on CCVID, it achieves 95.9% Rank-1 accuracy with 92.4% less computation than strong baselines while improving accuracy by 1.8%; on MEVID, it reduces computation by 41.3% while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: SeaCache通过考虑光谱演化，在保持内容相关组件的同时抑制噪声，从而显著提高了采样速度和质量

Abstract: Diffusion models are a strong backbone for visual generation, but their inherently sequential denoising process leads to slow inference. Previous methods accelerate sampling by caching and reusing intermediate outputs based on feature distances between adjacent timesteps. However, existing caching strategies typically rely on raw feature differences that entangle content and noise. This design overlooks spectral evolution, where low-frequency structure appears early and high-frequency detail is refined later. We introduce Spectral-Evolution-Aware Cache (SeaCache), a training-free cache schedule that bases reuse decisions on a spectrally aligned representation. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we derive a Spectral-Evolution-Aware (SEA) filter that preserves content-relevant components while suppressing noise. Employing SEA-filtered input features to estimate redundancy leads to dynamic schedules that adapt to content while respecting the spectral priors underlying the diffusion model. Extensive experiments on diverse visual generative models and the baselines show that SeaCache achieves state-of-the-art latency-quality trade-offs.

Conclusion: Proposed framework effectively localizes corresponding objects across different viewpoints in videos.

Abstract: We study the task of establishing object-level visual correspondence across different viewpoints in videos, focusing on the challenging egocentric-to-exocentric and exocentric-to-egocentric scenarios. We propose a simple yet effective framework based on conditional binary segmentation, where an object query mask is encoded into a latent representation to guide the localization of the corresponding object in a target video. To encourage robust, view-invariant representations, we introduce a cycle-consistency training objective: the predicted mask in the target view is projected back to the source view to reconstruct the original query mask. This bidirectional constraint provides a strong self-supervisory signal without requiring ground-truth annotations and enables test-time training (TTT) at inference. Experiments on the Ego-Exo4D and HANDAL-X benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimization objective and TTT strategy, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The powerful reasoning of modern Vision Language Models open a new frontier for advanced personalization study.

To address this gap, we introduce Life-Bench, a comprehensive, synthetically generated multimodal benchmark built on simulated user digital footprints. Life-Bench features over questions evaluating a wide spectrum of capabilities, from persona understanding to complex reasoning over historical data. These capabilities expand far beyond prior benchmarks, reflecting the critical demands essential for real-world applications.

Our experiments on Life-Bench reveal that existing methods falter significantly on complex personalized tasks, exposing a large performance headroom, especially in relational, temporal and aggregative reasoning.

Method: 引入MoBind，一个旨在解决三个挑战的层次对比学习框架：（1）过滤无关视觉背景，（2）建模结构化的多传感器IMU配置，（3）实现细粒度、亚秒级的时间对齐。

Result: 在mRi、TotalCapture和EgoHumans数据集上，MoBind在所有四个任务上均优于强基线，表现出鲁棒的细粒度时间对齐，同时在模态之间保持粗粒度语义一致性。

Conclusion: MoBind在跨模态检索、时间同步、主体和身体部位定位以及动作识别等方面表现出色。

Abstract: We aim to learn a joint representation between inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals and 2D pose sequences extracted from video, enabling accurate cross-modal retrieval, temporal synchronization, subject and body-part localization, and action recognition. To this end, we introduce MoBind, a hierarchical contrastive learning framework designed to address three challenges: (1) filtering out irrelevant visual background, (2) modeling structured multi-sensor IMU configurations, and (3) achieving fine-grained, sub-second temporal alignment. To isolate motion-relevant cues, MoBind aligns IMU signals with skeletal motion sequences rather than raw pixels. We further decompose full-body motion into local body-part trajectories, pairing each with its corresponding IMU to enable semantically grounded multi-sensor alignment. To capture detailed temporal correspondence, MoBind employs a hierarchical contrastive strategy that first aligns token-level temporal segments, then fuses local (body-part) alignment with global (body-wide) motion aggregation. Evaluated on mRi, TotalCapture, and EgoHumans, MoBind consistently outperforms strong baselines across all four tasks, demonstrating robust fine-grained temporal alignment while preserving coarse semantic consistency across modalities.

Training requires no patient-level pairing or image registration, and histopathology inputs are not used at inference.
  Results: Compared to the current state of the art, our approach increases sensitivity to clinically significant PCa (csPCa) at 60% specificity by 3.5% and improves overall sensitivity at 60% specificity by 1.2%.

Motivation: 生成式AI模型对知识产权（IP）构成了重大挑战，因为它们可以在不进行归属的情况下复制独特的艺术风格和概念。

Method: 提出TokenTrace，一种新的主动水印框架，通过同时扰动文本提示嵌入和引导扩散模型生成过程的初始潜在噪声，将秘密签名嵌入语义域。

Result: 在单概念（对象和风格）和多概念归属任务上实现了最先进的性能，显著优于现有基线，同时保持高视觉质量和对常见变换的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TokenTrace在知识产权归属方面具有显著优势，为生成式AI模型的知识产权保护提供了一种有效的方法。

Abstract: Generative AI models pose a significant challenge to intellectual property (IP), as they can replicate unique artistic styles and concepts without attribution. While watermarking offers a potential solution, existing methods often fail in complex scenarios where multiple concepts (e.g., an object and an artistic style) are composed within a single image. These methods struggle to disentangle and attribute each concept individually. In this work, we introduce TokenTrace, a novel proactive watermarking framework for robust, multi-concept attribution. Our method embeds secret signatures into the semantic domain by simultaneously perturbing the text prompt embedding and the initial latent noise that guide the diffusion model's generation process. For retrieval, we propose a query-based TokenTrace module that takes the generated image and a textual query specifying which concepts need to be retrieved (e.g., a specific object or style) as inputs. This query-based mechanism allows the module to disentangle and independently verify the presence of multiple concepts from a single generated image. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-concept (object and style) and multi-concept attribution tasks, significantly outperforming existing baselines while maintaining high visual quality and robustness to common transformations.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种新的方法，通过构建3D服装视频和采用Nano Banana进行图像编辑，实现了高质量的非等距图像-几何对之间的纹理生成，为行业级3D服装设计提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing industrial 3D garment meshes already cover most real-world clothing geometries, yet their texture diversity remains limited. To acquire more realistic textures, generative methods are often used to extract Physically-based Rendering (PBR) textures and materials from large collections of wild images and project them back onto garment meshes. However, most image-conditioned texture generation approaches require strict topological consistency between the input image and the input 3D mesh, or rely on accurate mesh deformation to match to the image poses, which significantly constrains the texture generation quality and flexibility. To address the challenging problem of non-isometric image-based garment texture generation, we construct 3D Garment Videos, a physically simulated, garment-centric dataset that provides consistent geometry and material supervision across diverse deformations, enabling robust cross-pose texture learning. We further employ Nano Banana for high-quality non-isometric image editing, achieving reliable cross-topology texture generation between non-isometric image-geometry pairs. Finally, we propose an iterative baking method via uncertainty-guided view selection and reweighting that fuses multi-view predictions into seamless, production-ready PBR textures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our feedforward dual-branch architecture generates versatile and spatially aligned PBR materials suitable for industry-level 3D garment design.

TL;DR: FishProtoNet是一种基于计算机视觉的非侵入性工具，用于濒危鱼类的性别识别，在产卵和产卵后阶段表现出高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确识别鱼类性别对于优化水产养殖和管理工作至关重要，特别是对于濒危物种。然而，大多数现有方法具有侵入性或压力性，可能会造成额外的死亡率，对受威胁或濒危的鱼类种群构成严重风险。

Method: 提出FishProtoNet，一种基于计算机视觉的非侵入性框架，用于识别加州原生濒危物种Delta smelt（Hypomesus transpacificus）在其整个生命周期中的性别。

Result: FishProtoNet在Delta smelt的产卵和产卵后阶段表现出强大的性能，准确率达到74.40%和81.16%，相应的F1分数为74.27%和79.43%。

Conclusion: FishProtoNet是一种有效的非侵入性工具，可以用于濒危鱼类的性别识别，有助于优化水产养殖和管理工作。

Abstract: Accurate sex identification in fish is vital for optimizing breeding and management strategies in aquaculture, particularly for species at the risk of extinction. However, most existing methods are invasive or stressful and may cause additional mortality, posing severe risks to threatened or endangered fish populations. To address these challenges, we propose FishProtoNet, a robust, non-invasive computer vision-based framework for sex identification of delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), an endangered fish species native to California, across its full life cycle. Unlike the traditional deep learning methods, FishProtoNet provides interpretability through learned prototype representations while improving robustness by leveraging foundation models to reduce the influence of background noise. Specifically, the FishProtoNet framework consists of three key components: fish regions of interest (ROIs) extraction using visual foundation model, feature extraction from fish ROIs and fish sex identification based on an interpretable prototype network. FishProtoNet demonstrates strong performance in delta smelt sex identification during early spawning and post-spawning stages, achieving the accuracies of 74.40% and 81.16% and corresponding F1 scores of 74.27% and 79.43% respectively. In contrast, delta smelt sex identification at the subadult stage remains challenging for current computer vision methods, likely due to less pronounced morphological differences in immature fish.

Abstract: Prompt tuning of large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP enables efficient task adaptation without updating model weights. However, it often leads to poor confidence calibration and unreliable predictive uncertainty. We address this problem by proposing a calibration framework that enhances predictive reliability while preserving the geometry of the pretrained CLIP embedding space, which is required for robust generalization. Our approach extends the standard cross-entropy loss with two complementary regularizers: (1) a mean-variance margin penalty that stabilizes inter-class logit margins by maximizing their average while minimizing dispersion, mitigating underconfidence and overconfidence spikes; and (2) a text moment-matching loss that aligns the first and second moments of tuned text embeddings with their frozen CLIP counterparts, preserving semantic dispersion crucial for generalization. Through extensive experiments across 7 prompt-tuning methods and 11 diverse datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) compared to competitive calibration techniques on both base and novel classes

TL;DR: OpenVO是一种新的Open-world视觉里程计框架，在有限输入条件下有效估计自我运动，提高了轨迹数据集构建的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有视觉里程计（VO）方法在有限输入条件下的不足，如固定观测频率和需要相机标定，我们提出了OpenVO框架。

Method: OpenVO通过在两帧姿态回归框架中显式编码时间动态信息，并利用来自基础模型的三维几何先验来估计真实世界尺度的自我运动。

Result: 在KITTI、nuScenes和Argoverse 2三个自动驾驶基准数据集上，OpenVO的性能比最先进的方法提高了20%以上，且在变化观测频率下表现更稳健。

Conclusion: OpenVO在真实世界3D重建和多样化的下游应用中展现出其优越性。

Abstract: We introduce OpenVO, a novel framework for Open-world Visual Odometry (VO) with temporal awareness under limited input conditions. OpenVO effectively estimates real-world-scale ego-motion from monocular dashcam footage with varying observation rates and uncalibrated cameras, enabling robust trajectory dataset construction from rare driving events recorded in dashcam. Existing VO methods are trained on fixed observation frequency (e.g., 10Hz or 12Hz), completely overlooking temporal dynamics information. Many prior methods also require calibrated cameras with known intrinsic parameters. Consequently, their performance degrades when (1) deployed under unseen observation frequencies or (2) applied to uncalibrated cameras. These significantly limit their generalizability to many downstream tasks, such as extracting trajectories from dashcam footage. To address these challenges, OpenVO (1) explicitly encodes temporal dynamics information within a two-frame pose regression framework and (2) leverages 3D geometric priors derived from foundation models. We validate our method on three major autonomous-driving benchmarks - KITTI, nuScenes, and Argoverse 2 - achieving more than 20 performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches. Under varying observation rate settings, our method is significantly more robust, achieving 46%-92% lower errors across all metrics. These results demonstrate the versatility of OpenVO for real-world 3D reconstruction and diverse downstream applications.

TL;DR: TeFlow通过时间集成策略实现多帧监督，显著提升了自监督前馈方法的性能，同时保持了高效实时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督前馈方法在场景流估计中提供实时效率，但两帧点对应关系的监督不可靠且在遮挡下经常失效。多帧监督通过结合来自过去帧的运动线索具有提供更稳定指导的潜力，但简单的两帧目标扩展无效，因为点对应关系在帧之间急剧变化，产生不一致的信号。

Method: 提出TeFlow，通过挖掘时间一致性的监督来为前馈模型提供多帧监督。TeFlow引入了一种时间集成策略，通过聚合从多个帧构建的候选池中最具时间一致性的运动线索来形成可靠的监督信号。

Result: 在Argoverse 2和nuScenes数据集上，TeFlow实现了性能提升，最高可达33%。该方法与领先的基于优化的方法表现相当，但速度提高了150倍。

Conclusion: TeFlow为自监督前馈方法建立了新的最先进水平，实现了显著的性能提升，同时保持了高效的实时性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised feed-forward methods for scene flow estimation offer real-time efficiency, but their supervision from two-frame point correspondences is unreliable and often breaks down under occlusions. Multi-frame supervision has the potential to provide more stable guidance by incorporating motion cues from past frames, yet naive extensions of two-frame objectives are ineffective because point correspondences vary abruptly across frames, producing inconsistent signals. In the paper, we present TeFlow, enabling multi-frame supervision for feed-forward models by mining temporally consistent supervision. TeFlow introduces a temporal ensembling strategy that forms reliable supervisory signals by aggregating the most temporally consistent motion cues from a candidate pool built across multiple frames. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TeFlow establishes a new state-of-the-art for self-supervised feed-forward methods, achieving performance gains of up to 33\% on the challenging Argoverse 2 and nuScenes datasets. Our method performs on par with leading optimization-based methods, yet speeds up 150 times. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/KTH-RPL/OpenSceneFlow along with trained model weights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I模型在文本引导的图像编辑应用中受到严重阻碍，导致图像失真和编辑区域与非编辑区域不一致。

Method: 提出了一种名为ChordEdit的模型无关、无训练、无反演的方法，将编辑重新定义为源文本提示和目标文本提示定义的源和目标分布之间的传输问题。利用动态最优传输理论，推导出一种基于低能量控制的策略。

Result: ChordEdit实现了快速、轻量级的精确编辑，在挑战性模型上实现了真正的实时编辑。

Conclusion: ChordEdit有效解决了现有T2I模型在文本引导图像编辑中的问题，提高了编辑质量和效率。

Abstract: The advent of one-step text-to-image (T2I) models offers unprecedented synthesis speed. However, their application to text-guided image editing remains severely hampered, as forcing existing training-free editors into a single inference step fails. This failure manifests as severe object distortion and a critical loss of consistency in non-edited regions, resulting from the high-energy, erratic trajectories produced by naive vector arithmetic on the models' structured fields. To address this problem, we introduce ChordEdit, a model agnostic, training-free, and inversion-free method that facilitates high-fidelity one-step editing. We recast editing as a transport problem between the source and target distributions defined by the source and target text prompts. Leveraging dynamic optimal transport theory, we derive a principled, low-energy control strategy. This strategy yields a smoothed, variance-reduced editing field that is inherently stable, facilitating the field to be traversed in a single, large integration step. A theoretically grounded and experimentally validated approach allows ChordEdit to deliver fast, lightweight and precise edits, finally achieving true real-time editing on these challenging models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于古代日本文书中的印章干扰，现有的Kuzushiji字符识别方法在印章干扰下难以保持识别精度。

Method: 提出了一种三阶段恢复引导的Kuzushiji字符识别（RG-KCR）框架，包括印章检测（阶段1）、字符分类（阶段3）和字符恢复（阶段2）。

Result: 实验结果表明，YOLOv12-medium模型在测试集上实现了98.0%的准确率和93.3%的召回率。阶段2提高了基于Vision Transformer（ViT）的Metom分类器的Top-1准确率，从93.45%提升到95.33%。

Conclusion: 所提出的RG-KCR框架有效地减轻了印章干扰，提高了Kuzushiji字符识别的准确性。

Abstract: Kuzushiji was one of the most popular writing styles in pre-modern Japan and was widely used in both personal letters and official documents. However, due to its highly cursive forms and extensive glyph variations, most modern Japanese readers cannot directly interpret Kuzushiji characters. Therefore, recent research has focused on developing automated Kuzushiji character recognition methods, which have achieved satisfactory performance on relatively clean Kuzushiji document images. However, existing methods struggle to maintain recognition accuracy under seal interference (e.g., when seals overlap characters), despite the frequent occurrence of seals in pre-modern Japanese documents. To address this challenge, we propose a three-stage restoration-guided Kuzushiji character recognition (RG-KCR) framework specifically designed to mitigate seal interference. We construct datasets for evaluating Kuzushiji character detection (Stage 1) and classification (Stage 3). Experimental results show that the YOLOv12-medium model achieves a precision of 98.0% and a recall of 93.3% on the constructed test set. We quantitatively evaluate the restoration performance of Stage 2 using PSNR and SSIM. In addition, we conduct an ablation study to demonstrate that Stage 2 improves the Top-1 accuracy of Metom, a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based Kuzushiji classifier employed in Stage 3, from 93.45% to 95.33%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ani3DHuman：结合运动学方法和视频扩散先验，实现高质量3D人动画


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D人动画方法在实现逼真度方面存在困难：基于运动学的方法缺乏非刚性动力学（例如，服装动力学），而利用视频扩散先验的方法可以合成非刚性运动，但遭受质量伪影和身份丢失的问题。

Method: 提出Ani3DHuman框架，结合基于运动学的动画和视频扩散先验。首先引入分层运动表示，将刚性运动与残余非刚性运动分离。刚性运动由运动学方法生成，然后生成粗略渲染以引导视频扩散模型生成视频序列，以恢复残余非刚性运动。针对基于扩散采样的恢复任务高度挑战性，提出一种新颖的自引导随机采样方法，通过结合随机采样（用于逼真度）和自引导（用于身份保真度）有效解决分布外问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法可以生成逼真的3D人动画，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Ani3DHuman框架有效地结合了运动学方法和视频扩散先验，实现了高质量的3D人动画生成。

Abstract: Current 3D human animation methods struggle to achieve photorealism: kinematics-based approaches lack non-rigid dynamics (e.g., clothing dynamics), while methods that leverage video diffusion priors can synthesize non-rigid motion but suffer from quality artifacts and identity loss. To overcome these limitations, we present Ani3DHuman, a framework that marries kinematics-based animation with video diffusion priors. We first introduce a layered motion representation that disentangles rigid motion from residual non-rigid motion. Rigid motion is generated by a kinematic method, which then produces a coarse rendering to guide the video diffusion model in generating video sequences that restore the residual non-rigid motion. However, this restoration task, based on diffusion sampling, is highly challenging, as the initial renderings are out-of-distribution, causing standard deterministic ODE samplers to fail. Therefore, we propose a novel self-guided stochastic sampling method, which effectively addresses the out-of-distribution problem by combining stochastic sampling (for photorealistic quality) with self-guidance (for identity fidelity). These restored videos provide high-quality supervision, enabling the optimization of the residual non-rigid motion field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \MethodName can generate photorealistic 3D human animation, outperforming existing methods. Code is available in https://github.com/qiisun/ani3dhuman.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在理解任务如视觉描述和视觉问答中表现出色，但在嵌入任务如检索中的应用具有挑战性。

Method: 提出CREM模型，该模型具有统一的框架，通过压缩感知注意力整合对比和生成目标，同时保留生成能力。

Result: CREM在MMEB上实现了最先进的检索性能，同时在多个理解基准上保持了强大的生成性能。

Conclusion: 生成监督可以进一步提高MLLMs在压缩驱动范式下的表示质量。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable success in comprehension tasks such as visual description and visual question answering. However, their direct application to embedding-based tasks like retrieval remains challenging due to the discrepancy between output formats and optimization objectives. Previous approaches often employ contrastive fine-tuning to adapt MLLMs for retrieval, but at the cost of losing their generative capabilities. We argue that both generative and embedding tasks fundamentally rely on shared cognitive mechanisms, specifically cross-modal representation alignment and contextual comprehension. To this end, we propose CREM (Compression-driven Representation Enhanced Model), with a unified framework that enhances multimodal representations for retrieval while preserving generative ability. Specifically, we introduce a compression-based prompt design with learnable chorus tokens to aggregate multimodal semantics and a compression-driven training strategy that integrates contrastive and generative objectives through compression-aware attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CREM achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance on MMEB while maintaining strong generative performance on multiple comprehension benchmarks. Our findings highlight that generative supervision can further improve the representational quality of MLLMs under the proposed compression-driven paradigm.

Result: 在新的数据集上，VIGiA在所有任务上都优于现有模型，在计划感知VQA任务上达到90%以上的准确率

Conclusion: VIGiA是一种有效的多模态对话模型，可以有效地理解并推理复杂的指导视频动作计划

Abstract: We introduce VIGiA, a novel multimodal dialogue model designed to understand and reason over complex, multi-step instructional video action plans. Unlike prior work which focuses mainly on text-only guidance, or treats vision and language in isolation, VIGiA supports grounded, plan-aware dialogue that requires reasoning over visual inputs, instructional plans, and interleaved user interactions. To this end, VIGiA incorporates two key capabilities: (1) multimodal plan reasoning, enabling the model to align uni- and multimodal queries with the current task plan and respond accurately; and (2) plan-based retrieval, allowing it to retrieve relevant plan steps in either textual or visual representations. Experiments were done on a novel dataset with rich Instructional Video Dialogues aligned with Cooking and DIY plans. Our evaluation shows that VIGiA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on all tasks in a conversational plan guidance setting, reaching over 90\% accuracy on plan-aware VQA.

TL;DR: UniMatch是一种新的框架，用于在强非等距形状之间构建密集语义对应关系，具有通用性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立形状之间的密集对应关系是计算机视觉和图形学中的关键任务，但现有方法依赖于近等距假设和同质主题类型（即仅适用于人类形状）。然而，为跨类别对象构建语义对应关系仍然具有挑战性，且相对较少受到关注。

Method: 提出UniMatch，一个语义感知的粗到细框架，用于在强非等距形状之间构建密集语义对应关系，而不限制对象类别。关键思想是将“粗”语义线索提升到“细”对应关系，这通过两个阶段实现。在“粗”阶段，进行类别无关的3D分割以获得非重叠语义部分，并提示多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）识别部分名称。然后，使用预训练的视觉语言模型（VLMs）提取文本嵌入，以构建匹配的语义部分。在“细”阶段，利用这些粗对应关系通过专门的基于排名的对比方案引导学习密集对应关系。

Result: 由于类别无关的分割、语言引导和基于排名的对比学习，该方法适用于通用对象类别，无需预定义部分提议，从而实现跨类别和非等距形状的通用匹配。大量实验表明，UniMatch在各种具有挑战性的场景中始终优于竞争方法。

Conclusion: UniMatch在构建强非等距形状之间的密集语义对应关系方面表现出色，具有通用性和有效性。

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences between shapes is a crucial task in computer vision and graphics, while prior approaches depend on near-isometric assumptions and homogeneous subject types (i.e., only operate for human shapes). However, building semantic correspondences for cross-category objects remains challenging and has received relatively little attention. To achieve this, we propose UniMatch, a semantic-aware, coarse-to-fine framework for constructing dense semantic correspondences between strongly non-isometric shapes without restricting object categories. The key insight is to lift "coarse" semantic cues into "fine" correspondence, which is achieved through two stages. In the "coarse" stage, we perform class-agnostic 3D segmentation to obtain non-overlapping semantic parts and prompt multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to identify part names. Then, we employ pretrained vision language models (VLMs) to extract text embeddings, enabling the construction of matched semantic parts. In the "fine" stage, we leverage these coarse correspondences to guide the learning of dense correspondences through a dedicated rank-based contrastive scheme. Thanks to class-agnostic segmentation, language guiding, and rank-based contrastive learning, our method is versatile for universal object categories and requires no predefined part proposals, enabling universal matching for inter-class and non-isometric shapes. Extensive experiments demonstrate UniMatch consistently outperforms competing methods in various challenging scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While vision-language models (VLMs) perform well in egocentric settings, their performance deteriorates when reasoning from allocentric viewpoints.

Method: Introducing Symbolic Projective Layout (SymPL), a framework that reformulates allocentric reasoning into symbolic-layout forms.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that this reformulation substantially improves performance in both allocentric and egocentric tasks, enhances robustness under visual illusions and multi-view scenarios.

Conclusion: SymPL provides an effective and principled approach for addressing complex perspective-aware spatial reasoning.

Abstract: Perspective-aware spatial reasoning involves understanding spatial relationships from specific viewpoints-either egocentric (observer-centered) or allocentric (object-centered). While vision-language models (VLMs) perform well in egocentric settings, their performance deteriorates when reasoning from allocentric viewpoints, where spatial relations must be inferred from the perspective of objects within the scene. In this study, we address this underexplored challenge by introducing Symbolic Projective Layout (SymPL), a framework that reformulates allocentric reasoning into symbolic-layout forms that VLMs inherently handle well. By leveraging four key factors-projection, abstraction, bipartition, and localization-SymPL converts allocentric questions into structured symbolic-layout representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this reformulation substantially improves performance in both allocentric and egocentric tasks, enhances robustness under visual illusions and multi-view scenarios, and that each component contributes critically to these gains. These results show that SymPL provides an effective and principled approach for addressing complex perspective-aware spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: StreetTree将成为城市街道树木精细管理和研究的核心资源，并推动计算机视觉和城市科学交叉领域的新进展。

Abstract: The fine-grained classification of street trees is a crucial task for urban planning, streetscape management, and the assessment of urban ecosystem services. However, progress in this field has been significantly hindered by the lack of large-scale, geographically diverse, and publicly available benchmark datasets specifically designed for street trees. To address this critical gap, we introduce StreetTree, the world's first large-scale benchmark dataset dedicated to fine-grained street tree classification. The dataset contains over 12 million images covering more than 8,300 common street tree species, collected from urban streetscapes across 133 countries spanning five continents, and supplemented with expert-verified observational data. StreetTree poses substantial challenges for pretrained vision models under complex urban environments: high inter-species visual similarity, long-tailed natural distributions, significant intra-class variations caused by seasonal changes, and diverse imaging conditions such as lighting, occlusions from buildings, and varying camera angles. In addition, we provide a hierarchical taxonomy (order-family-genus-species) to support research in hierarchical classification and representation learning. Through extensive experiments with various visual models, we establish strong baselines and reveal the limitations of existing methods in handling such real-world complexities. We believe that StreetTree will serve as a key resource for the refined management and research of urban street trees, while also driving new advancements at the intersection of computer vision and urban science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多现代人工智能的实际应用中，识别隐含的视觉和文本模式至关重要。然而，对于当前预训练的基础模型（如LLMs和VLMs）来说，处理长尾模式识别任务仍然具有挑战性。虽然微调预训练模型可以提高识别隐含模式的确切性，但由于缺乏训练数据和计算成本高，这通常是不切实际的。

Method: 提出ADAMAB，一个用于少量样本模式识别的高效嵌入校准框架。为了最大限度地减少计算成本，ADAMAB在固定嵌入模型之上训练嵌入无关的轻量级校准器，而不访问其参数。为了减轻对大规模训练数据的需要，我们引入了一种基于多臂老虎机（MAB）机制的自适应数据增强策略。通过修改上置信界算法，ADAMAB减少了梯度偏移，并在少量样本训练中提供了理论上保证的收敛。

Result: 多模态实验证明了ADAMAB的优越性能，在训练时，每个类别的初始数据样本少于5个时，准确率提高了40%。

Conclusion: ADAMAB是一种高效且有效的少量样本模式识别框架，可显著提高长尾模式识别任务的准确率。

Abstract: Recognizing implicit visual and textual patterns is essential in many real-world applications of modern AI. However, tackling long-tail pattern recognition tasks remains challenging for current pre-trained foundation models such as LLMs and VLMs. While finetuning pre-trained models can improve accuracy in recognizing implicit patterns, it is usually infeasible due to a lack of training data and high computational overhead. In this paper, we propose ADAMAB, an efficient embedding calibration framework for few-shot pattern recognition. To maximally reduce the computational costs, ADAMAB trains embedder-agnostic light-weight calibrators on top of fixed embedding models without accessing their parameters. To mitigate the need for large-scale training data, we introduce an adaptive data augmentation strategy based on the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) mechanism. With a modified upper confidence bound algorithm, ADAMAB diminishes the gradient shifting and offers theoretically guaranteed convergence in few-shot training. Our multi-modal experiments justify the superior performance of ADAMAB, with up to 40% accuracy improvement when training with less than 5 initial data samples of each class.

Abstract: Modality gap significantly restricts the effectiveness of multimodal fusion. Previous methods often use techniques such as diffusion models and adversarial learning to reduce the modality gap, but they typically focus on one-to-one alignment without exposing the data points of the source modality to the global distribution information of the target modality. To this end, leveraging the characteristic of rectified flow that can map one distribution to another via a straight trajectory, we extend rectified flow for modality distribution mapping. Specifically, we leverage the `one-to-many mapping' strategy in rectified flow that allows each data point of the source modality to observe the overall target distribution. This also alleviates the issue of insufficient paired data within each sample, enabling a more robust distribution transformation. Moreover, to achieve more accurate distribution mapping and address the ambiguous flow directions in one-to-many mapping, we design `adaptive relaxed alignment', enforcing stricter alignment for modality pairs belonging to the same sample, while applying relaxed mapping for pairs not belonging to the same sample or category. Additionally, to prevent information loss during distribution mapping, we introduce `cyclic rectified flow' to ensure the transferred features can be translated back to the original features, allowing multimodal representations to learn sufficient modality-specific information. After distribution alignment, our approach achieves very competitive results on multiple tasks of multimodal affective computing even with a simple fusion method, and visualizations verify that it can effectively reduce the modality gap.

Abstract: Dermatophytosis is commonly assessed using potassium hydroxide (KOH) microscopy, yet accurate recognition of fungal hyphae is hindered by artefacts, heterogeneous keratin clearance, and notable inter-observer variability. This study presents a transformer-based detection framework using the RT-DETR model architecture to achieve precise, query-driven localization of fungal structures in high-resolution KOH images. A dataset of 2,540 routinely acquired microscopy images was manually annotated using a multi-class strategy to explicitly distinguish fungal elements from confounding artefacts. The model was trained with morphology-preserving augmentations to maintain the structural integrity of thin hyphae. Evaluation on an independent test set demonstrated robust object-level performance, with a recall of 0.9737, precision of 0.8043, and an AP@0.50 of 93.56%. When aggregated for image-level diagnosis, the model achieved 100% sensitivity and 98.8% accuracy, correctly identifying all positive cases without missing a single diagnosis. Qualitative outputs confirmed the robust localization of low-contrast hyphae even in artefact-rich fields. These results highlight that an artificial intelligence (AI) system can serve as a highly reliable, automated screening tool, effectively bridging the gap between image-level analysis and clinical decision-making in dermatomycology.

Motivation: 为了减少VAE解码器的延迟，同时保持质量。

Method: （1）提出一种独立感知通道剪枝方法，以有效减轻严重通道冗余；（2）提出一种分阶段主导算子优化策略，以解决VAE解码器中广泛使用的因果3D卷积的高推理成本。

Result: Flash-VAED在Wan和LTX-Video VAE解码器上进行了大量实验，表明该方法在质量和速度方面均优于基线，实现了约6倍的速度提升，同时保持重建性能高达96.9%。

Conclusion: Flash-VAED通过微小的质量下降，将端到端生成管道加速了高达36%。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet their inference remains costly and time-consuming. As diffusion transformers become increasingly efficient, the latency bottleneck inevitably shifts to VAE decoders. To reduce their latency while maintaining quality, we propose a universal acceleration framework for VAE decoders that preserves full alignment with the original latent distribution. Specifically, we propose (1) an independence-aware channel pruning method to effectively mitigate severe channel redundancy, and (2) a stage-wise dominant operator optimization strategy to address the high inference cost of the widely used causal 3D convolutions in VAE decoders. Based on these innovations, we construct a Flash-VAED family. Moreover, we design a three-phase dynamic distillation framework that efficiently transfers the capabilities of the original VAE decoder to Flash-VAED. Extensive experiments on Wan and LTX-Video VAE decoders demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines in both quality and speed, achieving approximately a 6$\times$ speedup while maintaining the reconstruction performance up to 96.9%. Notably, Flash-VAED accelerates the end-to-end generation pipeline by up to 36% with negligible quality drops on VBench-2.0.

Conclusion: JavisDiT++有效地提高了JAVG的性能，为多模态生成任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: AIGC has rapidly expanded from text-to-image generation toward high-quality multimodal synthesis across video and audio. Within this context, joint audio-video generation (JAVG) has emerged as a fundamental task that produces synchronized and semantically aligned sound and vision from textual descriptions. However, compared with advanced commercial models such as Veo3, existing open-source methods still suffer from limitations in generation quality, temporal synchrony, and alignment with human preferences. To bridge the gap, this paper presents JavisDiT++, a concise yet powerful framework for unified modeling and optimization of JAVG. First, we introduce a modality-specific mixture-of-experts (MS-MoE) design that enables cross-modal interaction efficacy while enhancing single-modal generation quality. Then, we propose a temporal-aligned RoPE (TA-RoPE) strategy to achieve explicit, frame-level synchronization between audio and video tokens. Besides, we develop an audio-video direct preference optimization (AV-DPO) method to align model outputs with human preference across quality, consistency, and synchrony dimensions. Built upon Wan2.1-1.3B-T2V, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance merely with around 1M public training entries, significantly outperforming prior approaches in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Comprehensive ablation studies have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed modules.

Motivation: 针对多模态AQA在现实部署中遇到的模态缺失问题，提出BriMA方法。

Method: BriMA方法包括记忆引导的桥接插补模块和模态感知重放机制。

Result: 在三个多模态AQA数据集上，BriMA在模态缺失条件下提高了性能，平均提高了6-8%的相关性和12-15%的误差。

Conclusion: BriMA方法有助于提高多模态AQA系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) aims to score how well an action is performed and is widely used in sports analysis, rehabilitation assessment, and human skill evaluation. Multi-modal AQA has recently achieved strong progress by leveraging complementary visual and kinematic cues, yet real-world deployments often suffer from non-stationary modality imbalance, where certain modalities become missing or intermittently available due to sensor failures or annotation gaps. Existing continual AQA methods overlook this issue and assume that all modalities remain complete and stable throughout training, which restricts their practicality. To address this challenge, we introduce Bridged Modality Adaptation (BriMA), an innovative approach to multi-modal continual AQA under modality-missing conditions. BriMA consists of a memory-guided bridging imputation module that reconstructs missing modalities using both task-agnostic and task-specific representations, and a modality-aware replay mechanism that prioritizes informative samples based on modality distortion and distribution drift. Experiments on three representative multi-modal AQA datasets (RG, Fis-V, and FS1000) show that BriMA consistently improves performance under different modality-missing conditions, achieving 6--8\% higher correlation and 12--15\% lower error on average. These results demonstrate a step toward robust multi-modal AQA systems under real-world deployment constraints.

TL;DR: EMAD是一种基于多模态证据的阿尔茨海默病诊断框架，提高了诊断的透明度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析中的深度学习模型通常是黑盒，很少与临床指南一致或明确地将决策与支持性证据联系起来。这在阿尔茨海默病（AD）中尤为重要，预测应该基于解剖和临床发现。

Method: EMAD是一种视觉-语言框架，生成结构化的AD诊断报告，其中每个断言都明确基于多模态证据。EMAD使用分层句子-证据-解剖（SEA）定位机制：（i）句子到证据定位将生成的句子链接到临床证据短语，以及（ii）证据到解剖定位将相应的结构定位在3D脑MRI上。为了减少密集的注释需求，我们提出了GTX-Distill，它将定位行为从受有限监督训练的教师转移到在模型生成的报告上操作的学生。我们进一步引入了可执行的规则GRPO，这是一种带有可验证奖励的强化微调方案，强制执行临床一致性、协议遵从性和推理-诊断一致性。

Result: 在AD-MultiSense数据集上，EMAD实现了最先进的诊断准确率，并产生了比现有方法更透明、解剖更真实的报告。我们将发布代码和定位注释，以支持未来对可信赖的医疗视觉-语言模型的研究。

Conclusion: EMAD框架能够提高阿尔茨海默病诊断的透明度和准确性，并通过减少注释需求和支持未来研究，为可信医疗视觉-语言模型的发展做出了贡献。

Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image analysis often act as black boxes, seldom aligning with clinical guidelines or explicitly linking decisions to supporting evidence. This is especially critical in Alzheimer's disease (AD), where predictions should be grounded in both anatomical and clinical findings. We present EMAD, a vision-language framework that generates structured AD diagnostic reports in which each claim is explicitly grounded in multimodal evidence. EMAD uses a hierarchical Sentence-Evidence-Anatomy (SEA) grounding mechanism: (i) sentence-to-evidence grounding links generated sentences to clinical evidence phrases, and (ii) evidence-to-anatomy grounding localizes corresponding structures on 3D brain MRI. To reduce dense annotation requirements, we propose GTX-Distill, which transfers grounding behavior from a teacher trained with limited supervision to a student operating on model-generated reports. We further introduce Executable-Rule GRPO, a reinforcement fine-tuning scheme with verifiable rewards that enforces clinical consistency, protocol adherence, and reasoning-diagnosis coherence. On the AD-MultiSense dataset, EMAD achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and produces more transparent, anatomically faithful reports than existing methods. We will release code and grounding annotations to support future research in trustworthy medical vision-language models.

Motivation: Human mesh recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image is inherently ambiguous

Method: Dual-memory augmented HMR critique agent with self-reflection

Result: Superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches

Conclusion: Proposed method enhances the accuracy and consistency of human mesh recovery

Abstract: Human mesh recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image is inherently ambiguous, as multiple 3D poses can correspond to the same 2D observation. Recent diffusion-based methods tackle this by generating various hypotheses, but often sacrifice accuracy. They yield predictions that are either physically implausible or drift from the input image, especially under occlusion or in cluttered, in-the-wild scenes. To address this, we introduce a dual-memory augmented HMR critique agent with self-reflection to produce context-aware quality scores for predicted meshes. These scores distill fine-grained cues about 3D human motion structure, physical feasibility, and alignment with the input image. We use these scores to build a group-wise HMR preference dataset. Leveraging this dataset, we propose a group preference alignment framework for finetuning diffusion-based HMR models. This process injects the rich preference signals into the model, guiding it to generate more physically plausible and image-consistent human meshes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance in OCR-centric Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, illustrating their capability to process heterogeneous data and exhibit adaptability across varied contexts. However, these MLLMs rely on a Large Language Model (LLM) as the decoder, which is primarily designed for linguistic processing, and thus inherently lacks the positional reasoning required for precise visual tasks, such as text spotting and text grounding. Additionally, the extensive parameters of MLLMs necessitate substantial computational resources and large-scale data for effective training. Conversely, text spotting specialists achieve state-of-the-art coordinate predictions but lack semantic reasoning capabilities. This dichotomy motivates our key research question: Can we synergize the efficiency of specialists with the contextual power of LLMs to create a positionally-accurate MLLM? To overcome these challenges, we introduce PositionOCR, a parameter-efficient hybrid architecture that seamlessly integrates a text spotting model's positional strengths with an LLM's contextual reasoning. Comprising 131M trainable parameters, this framework demonstrates outstanding multi-modal processing capabilities, particularly excelling in tasks such as text grounding and text spotting, consistently surpassing traditional MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于合成孔径雷达（SAR）成像机制复杂，对散射特性敏感，且高质量文本语料库稀缺，导致视觉语言模型（VLM）在SAR领域的直接应用性能受限。

Method: 构建了首个SAR图像-文本-AlphaEarth特征三元组数据集，并开发了FUSAR-GPT，一种专门针对SAR的VLM。该模型创新性地引入地理空间基线模型作为'世界知识'先验，并通过'时空锚点'将多源遥感时间特征嵌入模型视觉骨干，以动态补偿SAR图像中目标稀疏表示。此外，设计了双阶段SFT策略来解耦大模型的先验注入和任务执行。

Result: 在多个典型的遥感视觉-语言基准测试中，FUSAR-GPT实现了最先进的性能，比主流基线模型高12%以上。

Conclusion: FUSAR-GPT通过引入地理空间基线模型和多源遥感时间特征，有效地提高了SAR图像的智能解释能力，在遥感视觉-语言任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Research on the intelligent interpretation of all-weather, all-time Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is crucial for advancing remote sensing applications. In recent years, although Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong open-world understanding capabilities on RGB images, their performance is severely limited when directly applied to the SAR field due to the complexity of the imaging mechanism, sensitivity to scattering features, and the scarcity of high-quality text corpora. To systematically address this issue, we constructed the inaugural SAR Image-Text-AlphaEarth feature triplet dataset and developed FUSAR-GPT, a VLM specifically for SAR. FUSAR-GPT innovatively introduces a geospatial baseline model as a 'world knowledge' prior and embeds multi-source remote-sensing temporal features into the model's visual backbone via 'spatiotemporal anchors', enabling dynamic compensation for the sparse representation of targets in SAR images. Furthermore, we designed a two-stage SFT strategy to decouple the knowledge injection and task execution of large models. The spatiotemporal feature embedding and the two-stage decoupling paradigm enable FUSAR-GPT to achieve state-of-the-art performance across several typical remote sensing visual-language benchmark tests, significantly outperforming mainstream baseline models by over 12%.

Motivation: Prompt tuning在有限监督下会改变预训练表示，导致下游特征偏离预训练流形，不利于迁移，从而降低泛化能力。

Method: 提出ManiPT框架，在预训练流形上执行提示调整，引入文本和图像模态的余弦一致性约束，将学习到的表示限制在预训练几何邻域内。同时，引入结构偏差，强制进行增量修正，引导适应可迁移的方向，以减轻对捷径学习的依赖。

Result: ManiPT在四种下游设置（未见类别泛化、少样本分类、跨数据集迁移和领域泛化）中均比基线方法获得更高的平均性能。

Conclusion: ManiPT能够缓解有限数据下的过拟合趋势，并提供关于有限监督下提示调整过拟合的明确视角。

Abstract: Prompt tuning introduces learnable prompt vectors that adapt pretrained vision-language models to downstream tasks in a parameter-efficient manner. However, under limited supervision, prompt tuning alters pretrained representations and drives downstream features away from the pretrained manifold toward directions that are unfavorable for transfer. This drift degrades generalization. To address this limitation, we propose ManiPT, a framework that performs prompt tuning on the pretrained manifold. ManiPT introduces cosine consistency constraints in both the text and image modalities to confine the learned representations within the pretrained geometric neighborhood. Furthermore, we introduce a structural bias that enforces incremental corrections, guiding the adaptation along transferable directions to mitigate reliance on shortcut learning. From a theoretical perspective, ManiPT alleviates overfitting tendencies under limited data. Our experiments cover four downstream settings: unseen-class generalization, few-shot classification, cross-dataset transfer, and domain generalization. Across these settings, ManiPT achieves higher average performance than baseline methods. Notably, ManiPT provides an explicit perspective on how prompt tuning overfits under limited supervision.

Abstract: Event cameras excel at high-speed, low-power, and high-dynamic-range scene perception. However, as they fundamentally record only relative intensity changes rather than absolute intensity, the resulting data streams suffer from a significant loss of spatial information and static texture details. In this paper, we address this limitation by leveraging the generative prior of a pre-trained video diffusion model to reconstruct high-fidelity video frames from sparse event data. Specifically, we first establish a baseline model by directly applying event data as a condition to synthesize videos. Then, based on the physical correlation between the event stream and video frames, we further introduce the event-based inter-frame residual guidance to enhance the accuracy of video frame reconstruction. Furthermore, we extend our method to video frame interpolation and prediction in a zero-shot manner by modulating the reverse diffusion sampling process, thereby creating a unified event-to-frame reconstruction framework. Experimental results on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively. We also refer the reviewers to the video demo contained in the supplementary material for video results. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/CS-GangXu/UniE2F.

Result: 在四个大规模公共数据集上的实验结果表明，GS-CLIP在检测方面取得了优越的性能。

Conclusion: GS-CLIP框架有效地提高了零样本3D异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot 3D Anomaly Detection is an emerging task that aims to detect anomalies in a target dataset without any target training data, which is particularly important in scenarios constrained by sample scarcity and data privacy concerns. While current methods adapt CLIP by projecting 3D point clouds into 2D representations, they face challenges. The projection inherently loses some geometric details, and the reliance on a single 2D modality provides an incomplete visual understanding, limiting their ability to detect diverse anomaly types. To address these limitations, we propose the Geometry-Aware Prompt and Synergistic View Representation Learning (GS-CLIP) framework, which enables the model to identify geometric anomalies through a two-stage learning process. In stage 1, we dynamically generate text prompts embedded with 3D geometric priors. These prompts contain global shape context and local defect information distilled by our Geometric Defect Distillation Module (GDDM). In stage 2, we introduce Synergistic View Representation Learning architecture that processes rendered and depth images in parallel. A Synergistic Refinement Module (SRM) subsequently fuses the features of both streams, capitalizing on their complementary strengths. Comprehensive experimental results on four large-scale public datasets show that GS-CLIP achieves superior performance in detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割对于临床诊断和定量分析至关重要，但受到成像模态异质性和像素级标注高成本的限制，仍然具有挑战性。尽管像SAM这样的通用交互式分割模型取得了显著进展，但其在医学图像中的应用仍面临两个关键瓶颈：一是缺乏针对模态和特定解剖任务的适应性机制，这限制了在分布外医学场景中的泛化；二是当前的医学适应性方法在没有选择的情况下在大规模、异质数据集上进行微调，导致噪声监督、成本增加和负迁移。

Method: 我们提出了SegMoTE，一个高效且自适应的医学图像分割框架。SegMoTE保留了SAM的原始提示界面、高效推理和零样本泛化能力，同时引入少量可学习参数以动态适应不同模态和任务。此外，我们设计了一种渐进式提示标记化机制，使分割过程完全自动化，显著减少了标注依赖。在MedSeg-HQ数据集上训练，该数据集小于现有大型数据集的1%，SegMoTE在多种成像模态和解剖任务上实现了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: SegMoTE是一个高效且自适应的医学图像分割框架，它解决了现有方法的瓶颈，并在低标注成本下实现了对医学图像分割的显著改进。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis and quantitative analysis, yet remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of imaging modalities and the high cost of pixel-level annotations. Although general interactive segmentation models like SAM have achieved remarkable progress, their transfer to medical imaging still faces two key bottlenecks: (i) the lack of adaptive mechanisms for modality- and anatomy-specific tasks, which limits generalization in out-of-distribution medical scenarios; and (ii) current medical adaptation methods fine-tune on large, heterogeneous datasets without selection, leading to noisy supervision, higher cost, and negative transfer. To address these issues, we propose SegMoTE, an efficient and adaptive framework for medical image segmentation. SegMoTE preserves SAM's original prompt interface, efficient inference, and zero-shot generalization while introducing only a small number of learnable parameters to dynamically adapt across modalities and tasks. In addition, we design a progressive prompt tokenization mechanism that enables fully automatic segmentation, significantly reducing annotation dependence. Trained on MedSeg-HQ, a curated dataset less than 1% of existing large-scale datasets, SegMoTE achieves SOTA performance across diverse imaging modalities and anatomical tasks. It represents the first efficient, robust, and scalable adaptation of general segmentation models to the medical domain under extremely low annotation cost, advancing the practical deployment of foundation vision models in clinical applications.

Abstract: With the rapid development of remote sensing image archives, asking questions about images has become an effective way of gathering specific information or performing semantic image retrieval. However, current automatically generated questions tend to be simplistic and template-based, which hinders the deployment of question answering or visual dialogue systems for real-world applications. To enrich and diversify the questions with both image content and commonsense knowledge, we propose a Knowledge-aware Remote Sensing Visual Question Generation model (KRSVQG). The proposed model incorporates related knowledge triplets from external knowledge sources to broaden the question content, while employing image captioning as an intermediary representation to ground questions to the corresponding images. Moreover, KRSVQG utilizes a vision-language pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, enabling the model's adaptation to low data regimes. To evaluate the proposed KRSVQG model, we construct two knowledge-aware remote sensing visual question generation datasets: the NWPU-300 dataset and the TextRS-300 dataset. Evaluations, including metrics and human assessment, demonstrate that KRSVQG outperforms existing methods and leads to rich questions, grounded in both image and domain knowledge. As a key practice in vision-language research, knowledge-aware visual question generation advances the understanding of image content beyond pixels, facilitating the development of knowledge-enriched vision-language systems with vision-grounded human commonsense.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地解决标签稀缺和类别不平衡问题，提高AU检测器的准确性，并产生更解耦的预测，同时减少伪影并更好地保留身份。

Abstract: Deep learning vision models excel with abundant supervision, but many applications face label scarcity and class imbalance. Controllable image editing can augment scarce labeled data, yet edits often introduce artifacts and entangle non-target attributes. We study this in facial expression analysis, targeting Action Unit (AU) manipulation where annotation is costly and AU co-activation drives entanglement. We present a facial manipulation method that operates in the semantic latent space of a pre-trained face generator (Diffusion Autoencoder). Using lightweight linear models, we reduce entanglement of semantic features via (i) dependency-aware conditioning that accounts for AU co-activation, and (ii) orthogonal projection that removes nuisance attribute directions (e.g., glasses), together with an expression neutralization step to enable absolute AU edit. We use these edits to balance AU occurrence by editing labeled faces and to diversify identities/demographics via controlled synthesis. Augmenting AU detector training with the generated data improves accuracy and yields more disentangled predictions with fewer co-activation shortcuts, outperforming alternative data-efficient training strategies and suggesting improvements similar to what would require substantially more labeled data in our learning-curve analysis. Compared to prior methods, our edits are stronger, produce fewer artifacts, and preserve identity better.

Motivation: 自动生成的图像问题往往简单、模板化，阻碍了问答或视觉对话系统的实际部署。

Method: 提出一个名为KRSVQG的知识感知遥感视觉问题生成模型，该模型结合外部知识来丰富和多样化问题。

Result: 在NWPU-300和TextRS-300数据集上，KRSVQG优于现有方法，生成的问题知识丰富，基于图像和领域知识。

Conclusion: KRSVQG模型能够有效提高图像问题的质量和上下文理解。

Abstract: With the rapid development of remote sensing image archives, asking questions about images has become an effective way of gathering specific information or performing image retrieval. However, automatically generated image-based questions tend to be simplistic and template-based, which hinders the real deployment of question answering or visual dialogue systems. To enrich and diversify the questions, we propose a knowledge-aware remote sensing visual question generation model, KRSVQG, that incorporates external knowledge related to the image content to improve the quality and contextual understanding of the generated questions. The model takes an image and a related knowledge triplet from external knowledge sources as inputs and leverages image captioning as an intermediary representation to enhance the image grounding of the generated questions. To assess the performance of KRSVQG, we utilized two datasets that we manually annotated: NWPU-300 and TextRS-300. Results on these two datasets demonstrate that KRSVQG outperforms existing methods and leads to knowledge-enriched questions, grounded in both image and domain knowledge.

TL;DR: 提出LAVIDA，一种新的端到端无样本视频异常检测框架，在零样本设置下实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频异常数据收集和检测长期以来一直是一个具有挑战性的问题，因为其发生频率低和时空稀缺。现有的视频异常检测（VAD）方法在开放世界场景下表现不佳。主要贡献因素包括数据集多样性有限，以及对上下文相关异常语义理解不足。

Method: 提出LAVIDA，一个端到端的无样本视频异常检测框架。LAVIDA采用异常暴露采样器，将分割的对象转换为伪异常，以增强模型对未见异常类别的适应性。它还集成了多模态大型语言模型（MLLM），以增强语义理解能力。此外，设计了一种基于反向注意力的标记压缩方法，以处理异常模式的时空稀缺性和降低计算成本。训练过程仅使用伪异常，而不使用任何VAD数据。

Result: 在四个基准VAD数据集上的评估表明，LAVIDA在零样本设置下，在帧级和像素级异常检测中都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LAVIDA在零样本视频异常检测方面取得了显著成果，为未来研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: The collection and detection of video anomaly data has long been a challenging problem due to its rare occurrence and spatio-temporal scarcity. Existing video anomaly detection (VAD) methods under perform in open-world scenarios. Key contributing factors include limited dataset diversity, and inadequate understanding of context-dependent anomalous semantics. To address these issues, i) we propose LAVIDA, an end-to-end zero-shot video anomaly detection framework. ii) LAVIDA employs an Anomaly Exposure Sampler that transforms segmented objects into pseudo-anomalies to enhance model adaptability to unseen anomaly categories. It further integrates a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to bolster semantic comprehension capabilities. Additionally, iii) we design a token compression approach based on reverse attention to handle the spatio-temporal scarcity of anomalous patterns and decrease computational cost. The training process is conducted solely on pseudo anomalies without any VAD data. Evaluations across four benchmark VAD datasets demonstrate that LAVIDA achieves SOTA performance in both frame-level and pixel-level anomaly detection under the zero-shot setting. Our code is available in https://github.com/VitaminCreed/LAVIDA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的注意力监督扩散框架，实现了基于扩散的风格迁移中精确的空间控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确空间控制在基于扩散的风格迁移中仍然具有挑战性。这是因为扩散模型将风格视为全局特征，缺乏对风格表示的显式空间定位，这使得将风格的应用限制在特定对象或区域变得困难。

Method: 我们提出了一种注意力监督的扩散框架，通过在训练过程中将风格标记的注意力得分与对象掩码对齐，显式地教会模型在哪里应用给定的风格。此外，我们还引入了两个互补目标：基于KL散度的Focus损失和基于二元交叉熵的Cover损失，共同促进准确的定位和密集的覆盖。我们还采用模块化的LoRA-MoE设计，以实现高效且可扩展的多风格适应。为了评估区域风格化，我们引入了区域风格编辑分数，该分数通过CLIP基础上的相似性来衡量目标区域内的区域风格匹配，并通过掩码LPIPS和像素级一致性在未编辑区域上保持身份。

Result: 实验表明，我们的方法在推理时实现了无掩码、单个对象的风格迁移，产生了区域准确且视觉上协调的结果，优于现有的基于扩散的编辑方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地解决了基于扩散的风格迁移中的空间控制问题，提高了风格迁移的准确性，并实现了高效的风格适应。

Abstract: Precise spatial control in diffusion-based style transfer remains challenging. This challenge arises because diffusion models treat style as a global feature and lack explicit spatial grounding of style representations, making it difficult to restrict style application to specific objects or regions. To our knowledge, existing diffusion models are unable to perform true localized style transfer, typically relying on handcrafted masks or multi-stage post-processing that introduce boundary artifacts and limit generalization. To address this, we propose an attention-supervised diffusion framework that explicitly teaches the model where to apply a given style by aligning the attention scores of style tokens with object masks during training. Two complementary objectives, a Focus loss based on KL divergence and a Cover loss using binary cross-entropy, jointly encourage accurate localization and dense coverage. A modular LoRA-MoE design further enables efficient and scalable multi-style adaptation. To evaluate localized stylization, we introduce the Regional Style Editing Score, which measures Regional Style Matching through CLIP-based similarity within the target region and Identity Preservation via masked LPIPS and pixel-level consistency on unedited areas. Experiments show that our method achieves mask-free, single-object style transfer at inference, producing regionally accurate and visually coherent results that outperform existing diffusion-based editing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了识别视觉模型中的最小、充分和决策保持的解释，我们引入了一个无梯度的框架。

Method: 我们采用了一种名为DD-CAM的方法，通过隔离最小的表示单元子集来识别这些解释。我们利用delta debugging算法，并根据分类器头中的单元交互来配置其搜索策略。

Result: 我们的实验评估表明，与基于CAM的现有方法相比，我们的方法可以产生更忠实、更精确的解释。

Conclusion: DD-CAM是一种有效的框架，可以用于识别视觉模型中的最小、充分和决策保持的解释，并产生更精确的解释和定位准确性。

Abstract: We introduce a gradient-free framework for identifying minimal, sufficient, and decision-preserving explanations in vision models by isolating the smallest subset of representational units whose joint activation preserves predictions. Unlike existing approaches that aggregate all units, often leading to cluttered saliency maps, our approach, DD-CAM, identifies a 1-minimal subset whose joint activation suffices to preserve the prediction (i.e., removing any unit from the subset alters the prediction). To efficiently isolate minimal sufficient subsets, we adapt delta debugging, a systematic reduction strategy from software debugging, and configure its search strategy based on unit interactions in the classifier head: testing individual units for models with non-interacting units and testing unit combinations for models in which unit interactions exist. We then generate minimal, prediction-preserving saliency maps that highlight only the most essential features. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach can produce more faithful explanations and achieve higher localization accuracy than the state-of-the-art CAM-based approaches.

Method: 提出了一种两阶段检测跟踪框架，用于在传送带环境中进行稳定的苹果质量检测。使用果园训练的YOLOv8模型进行苹果定位，然后使用ByteTrack多目标跟踪来保持持续的身份。应用ResNet18缺陷分类器对裁剪的苹果区域进行分类，该分类器在健康-有缺陷的水果数据集上进行了微调。引入了跟踪级别的聚合来强制执行时间一致性和减少帧间预测的振荡。定义了视频级别的工业指标，如跟踪级别的缺陷比和时间一致性，以评估系统在实际处理条件下的鲁棒性。

Result: 结果表明，与逐帧推理相比，集成跟踪提高了稳定性，表明对于实际的自动化水果分级系统，集成跟踪是必不可少的。

Conclusion: 集成跟踪对于提高工业水果检测系统的稳定性和鲁棒性至关重要。

Abstract: Industrial fruit inspection systems must operate reliably under dense multi-object interactions and continuous motion, yet most existing works evaluate detection or classification at the image level without ensuring temporal stability in video streams. We present a two-stage detection-tracking framework for stable multi-apple quality inspection in conveyor-belt environments. An orchard-trained YOLOv8 model performs apple localization, followed by ByteTrack multi-object tracking to maintain persistent identities. A ResNet18 defect classifier, fine-tuned on a healthy-defective fruit dataset, is applied to cropped apple regions. Track-level aggregation is introduced to enforce temporal consistency and reduce prediction oscillation across frames. We define video-level industrial metrics such as track-level defect ratio and temporal consistency to evaluate system robustness under realistic processing conditions. Results demonstrate improved stability compared to frame-wise inference, suggesting that integrating tracking is essential for practical automated fruit grading systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的MRI对比度增强动力学世界模型，通过时空一致性学习提高采集效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床MRI对比度采集效率低下，导致高风险和成本高昂的采集协议与固定的稀疏采集序列之间存在不匹配。应用世界模型模拟人体中的对比度增强动力学可以实现连续的对比度自由动力学。然而，MRI采集中的低时间分辨率限制了世界模型的训练，导致数据集采样稀疏。直接训练生成模型捕获动力学存在两个限制：(a) 由于缺少缺失时间的数据，模型倾向于过度拟合无关特征，导致内容扭曲。(b) 由于缺乏连续的时间监督，模型无法学习时间上的连续动力学规律，导致时间不连续。

Method: 提出了一种名为MRI对比度增强动力学世界模型（MRI CEKWorld）的模型，并引入了时空一致性学习（STCL）。(a) 通过患者级结构在增强过程中保持一致的空间法则，提出潜在对齐学习（LAL），构建一个患者特定的模板以约束内容与该模板对齐。(b) 通过动力学遵循一致平滑趋势的时间法则，提出潜在差异学习（LDL），通过插值扩展未观察到的间隔，并约束插值序列之间潜在空间中的平滑变化。

Result: 在两个数据集上的大量实验表明，MRI CEKWorld实现了更逼真的内容和动力学。

Conclusion: MRI CEKWorld模型通过时空一致性学习提高了MRI对比度采集的效率和质量。

Abstract: Clinical MRI contrast acquisition suffers from inefficient information yield, which presents as a mismatch between the risky and costly acquisition protocol and the fixed and sparse acquisition sequence. Applying world models to simulate the contrast enhancement kinetics in the human body enables continuous contrast-free dynamics. However, the low temporal resolution in MRI acquisition restricts the training of world models, leading to a sparsely sampled dataset. Directly training a generative model to capture the kinetics leads to two limitations: (a) Due to the absence of data on missing time, the model tends to overfit to irrelevant features, leading to content distortion. (b) Due to the lack of continuous temporal supervision, the model fails to learn the continuous kinetics law over time, causing temporal discontinuities. For the first time, we propose MRI Contrast Enhancement Kinetics World model (MRI CEKWorld) with SpatioTemporal Consistency Learning (STCL). For (a), guided by the spatial law that patient-level structures remain consistent during enhancement, we propose Latent Alignment Learning (LAL) that constructs a patient-specific template to constrain contents to align with this template. For (b), guided by the temporal law that the kinetics follow a consistent smooth trend, we propose Latent Difference Learning (LDL) which extends the unobserved intervals by interpolation and constrains smooth variations in the latent space among interpolated sequences. Extensive experiments on two datasets show our MRI CEKWorld achieves better realistic contents and kinetics. Codes will be available at https://github.com/DD0922/MRI-Contrast-Enhancement-Kinetics-World-Model.

TL;DR: 提出IPv2策略，有效提升低剂量CT图像去噪效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决图像纯化策略在噪声抑制和肺实质去噪方面的局限性

Method: 提出改进的IPv2策略，包括去除背景、添加噪声和去除噪声三个核心模块

Result: IPv2策略在多个主流去噪模型中显著提高了背景抑制和肺实质恢复能力

Conclusion: IPv2策略有效提升了图像纯化效果，为低剂量CT图像去噪提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: The image purification strategy constructs an intermediate distribution with aligned anatomical structures, which effectively corrects the spatial misalignment between real-world ultra-low-dose CT and normal-dose CT images and significantly enhances the structural preservation ability of denoising models. However, this strategy exhibits two inherent limitations. First, it suppresses noise only in the chest wall and bone regions while leaving the image background untreated. Second, it lacks a dedicated mechanism for denoising the lung parenchyma. To address these issues, we systematically redesign the original image purification strategy and propose an improved version termed IPv2. The proposed strategy introduces three core modules, namely Remove Background, Add noise, and Remove noise. These modules endow the model with denoising capability in both background and lung tissue regions during training data construction and provide a more reasonable evaluation protocol through refined label construction at the testing stage. Extensive experiments on our previously established real-world patient lung CT dataset acquired at 2% radiation dose demonstrate that IPv2 consistently improves background suppression and lung parenchyma restoration across multiple mainstream denoising models. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/MonkeyDadLufy/Image-Purification-Strategy-v2.

Motivation: Unified Speech Recognition (USR) 在音频、视觉和音频视觉语音识别中取得了最先进的成果，但其训练成本高，且容易受到分布偏移的影响。

Method: 提出CTC驱动的teacher forcing和混合采样方法，以减少训练时间和提高鲁棒性。

Result: USR 2.0方法在LRS3、LRS2和WildVSR上取得了最先进的成果，超过了USR和特定模态的自监督基线。

Conclusion: USR 2.0方法通过CTC驱动的teacher forcing和混合采样，提高了USR的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Unified Speech Recognition (USR) has emerged as a semi-supervised framework for training a single model for audio, visual, and audiovisual speech recognition, achieving state-of-the-art results on in-distribution benchmarks. However, its reliance on autoregressive pseudo-labelling makes training expensive, while its decoupled supervision of CTC and attention branches increases susceptibility to self-reinforcing errors, particularly under distribution shifts involving longer sequences, noise, or unseen domains. We propose CTC-driven teacher forcing, where greedily decoded CTC pseudo-labels are fed into the decoder to generate attention targets in a single forward pass. Although these can be globally incoherent, in the pseudo-labelling setting they enable efficient and effective knowledge transfer. Because CTC and CTC-driven attention pseudo-labels have the same length, the decoder can predict both simultaneously, benefiting from the robustness of CTC and the expressiveness of attention without costly beam search. We further propose mixed sampling to mitigate the exposure bias of the decoder relying solely on CTC inputs. The resulting method, USR 2.0, halves training time, improves robustness to out-of-distribution inputs, and achieves state-of-the-art results on LRS3, LRS2, and WildVSR, surpassing USR and modality-specific self-supervised baselines.

Motivation: 超声成像由于其固有的噪声采集过程，对表示学习提出了独特的挑战。低信噪比和随机的斑马纹图案阻碍了依赖于像素级重建目标的标准自监督学习方法。

Method: 我们提出了US-JEPA，这是一种自监督框架，采用静态教师非对称潜在训练（SALT）目标。通过使用冻结的、特定领域的教师来提供稳定的潜在目标，US-JEPA将学生-教师优化解耦，并推动学生扩展教师的语义先验。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，掩码潜在预测为稳健超声表示提供了一个稳定且高效的方法。

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging poses unique challenges for representation learning due to its inherently noisy acquisition process. The low signal-to-noise ratio and stochastic speckle patterns hinder standard self-supervised learning methods relying on a pixel-level reconstruction objective. Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) address this drawback by predicting masked latent representations rather than raw pixels. However, standard approaches depend on hyperparameter-brittle and computationally expensive online teachers updated via exponential moving average. We propose US-JEPA, a self-supervised framework that adopts the Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training (SALT) objective. By using a frozen, domain-specific teacher to provide stable latent targets, US-JEPA decouples student-teacher optimization and pushes the student to expand upon the semantic priors of the teacher. In addition, we provide the first rigorous comparison of all publicly available state-of-the-art ultrasound foundation models on UltraBench, a public dataset benchmark spanning multiple organs and pathological conditions. Under linear probing for diverse classification tasks, US-JEPA achieves performance competitive with or superior to domain-specific and universal vision foundation model baselines. Our results demonstrate that masked latent prediction provides a stable and efficient path toward robust ultrasound representations.

Conclusion: 本研究通过分析3D高斯分裂在对抗性扰动下的行为，设计了一种频率感知的防御策略，显著提高了3D高斯分裂的鲁棒性，而无需访问干净的地面真实监督。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for real-time and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from posed images. However, recent studies reveal its vulnerability to adversarial corruptions in input views, where imperceptible yet consistent perturbations can drastically degrade rendering quality, increase training and rendering time, and inflate memory usage, even leading to server denial-of-service. In our work, to mitigate this issue, we begin by analyzing the distinct behaviors of adversarial perturbations in the low- and high-frequency components of input images using wavelet transforms. Based on this observation, we design a simple yet effective frequency-aware defense strategy that reconstructs training views by filtering high-frequency noise while preserving low-frequency content. This approach effectively suppresses adversarial artifacts while maintaining the authenticity of the original scene. Notably, it does not significantly impair training on clean data, achieving a desirable trade-off between robustness and performance on clean inputs. Through extensive experiments under a wide range of attack intensities on multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method substantially enhances the robustness of 3DGS without access to clean ground-truth supervision. By highlighting and addressing the overlooked vulnerabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting, our work paves the way for more robust and secure 3D reconstructions.

Abstract: Acquiring aligned visuo-tactile datasets is slow and costly, requiring specialised hardware and large-scale data collection. Synthetic generation is promising, but prior methods are typically single-modality, limiting cross-modal learning. We present MultiDiffSense, a unified diffusion model that synthesises images for multiple vision-based tactile sensors (ViTac, TacTip, ViTacTip) within a single architecture. Our approach uses dual conditioning on CAD-derived, pose-aligned depth maps and structured prompts that encode sensor type and 4-DoF contact pose, enabling controllable, physically consistent multi-modal synthesis. Evaluating on 8 objects (5 seen, 3 novel) and unseen poses, MultiDiffSense outperforms a Pix2Pix cGAN baseline in SSIM by +36.3% (ViTac), +134.6% (ViTacTip), and +64.7% (TacTip). For downstream 3-DoF pose estimation, mixing 50% synthetic with 50% real halves the required real data while maintaining competitive performance. MultiDiffSense alleviates the data-collection bottleneck in tactile sensing and enables scalable, controllable multi-modal dataset generation for robotic applications.

Conclusion: UP-Fuse 在视觉损坏或错位的情况下仍能保持强大的性能，使其非常适合用于安全关键设置中的机器人感知。

Abstract: LiDAR-camera fusion enhances 3D panoptic segmentation by leveraging camera images to complement sparse LiDAR scans, but it also introduces a critical failure mode. Under adverse conditions, degradation or failure of the camera sensor can significantly compromise the reliability of the perception system. To address this problem, we introduce UP-Fuse, a novel uncertainty-aware fusion framework in the 2D range-view that remains robust under camera sensor degradation, calibration drift, and sensor failure. Raw LiDAR data is first projected into the range-view and encoded by a LiDAR encoder, while camera features are simultaneously extracted and projected into the same shared space. At its core, UP-Fuse employs an uncertainty-guided fusion module that dynamically modulates cross-modal interaction using predicted uncertainty maps. These maps are learned by quantifying representational divergence under diverse visual degradations, ensuring that only reliable visual cues influence the fused representation. The fused range-view features are decoded by a novel hybrid 2D-3D transformer that mitigates spatial ambiguities inherent to the 2D projection and directly predicts 3D panoptic segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on Panoptic nuScenes, SemanticKITTI, and our introduced Panoptic Waymo benchmark demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of UP-Fuse, which maintains strong performance even under severe visual corruption or misalignment, making it well suited for robotic perception in safety-critical settings.

Conclusion: PoseCraft is an effective method for generating photorealistic avatars with 3D pose and camera controls.

Abstract: Digitizing humans and synthesizing photorealistic avatars with explicit 3D pose and camera controls are central to VR, telepresence, and entertainment. Existing skinning-based workflows require laborious manual rigging or template-based fittings, while neural volumetric methods rely on canonical templates and re-optimization for each unseen pose. We present PoseCraft, a diffusion framework built around tokenized 3D interface: instead of relying only on rasterized geometry as 2D control images, we encode sparse 3D landmarks and camera extrinsics as discrete conditioning tokens and inject them into diffusion via cross-attention. Our approach preserves 3D semantics by avoiding 2D re-projection ambiguity under large pose and viewpoint changes, and produces photorealistic imagery that faithfully captures identity and appearance. To train and evaluate at scale, we also implement GenHumanRF, a data generation workflow that renders diverse supervision from volumetric reconstructions. Our experiments show that PoseCraft achieves significant perceptual quality improvement over diffusion-centric methods, and attains better or comparable metrics to latest volumetric rendering SOTA while better preserving fabric and hair details.

Abstract: Spatial visualization is the mental ability to imagine, transform, and manipulate the spatial characteristics of objects and actions. This intelligence is a part of human cognition where actions and perception are connected on a mental level. To explore whether state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit this ability, we develop MentalBlackboard, an open-ended spatial visualization benchmark for Paper Folding and Hole Punching tests within two core tasks: prediction and planning. Our prediction experiments reveal that models struggle with applying symmetrical transformations, even when they predict the sequence of unfolding steps correctly. Also, rotations introduce a significant challenge to the physical situational awareness for models. The planning task reveals limitations of models in analyzing symmetrical relationships and in implementing the multi-stage symmetry process, with Claude Opus 4.1 achieving the highest planning score at an accuracy of 10\%. The top-performing model, o3, attains a peak performance of 71.6\% on the generalization task, which does not require spatial visualization but transfers spatial data; however, it achieves only 25\% accuracy on text-based prediction tasks.

*Fangyi Chen,Yaojie Shen,Lu Xu,Ye Yuan,Shu Zhang,Yulei Niu,Longyin Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的任务和模型，用于从单个图像中预测和编辑图像的各个层次，以实现更高级的图像编辑和组合生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了实现高级图像编辑和组合生成，精确、感知视觉内容是至关重要的。然而，大多数现有方法在整体上操作整个图像，限制了孤立和操作单个场景元素的能力。与之一致，层次表示将场景明确地分为对象、环境上下文和视觉效果，为解释和编辑视觉内容提供了更直观和结构化的框架。

Method: 提出了一种名为“Referring Layer Decomposition (RLD)”的任务，该任务从单个RGB图像中预测完整的RGBA层，基于灵活的用户提示，如空间输入（例如，点、框、掩码）、自然语言描述或其组合。

Result: 建立了RefLade，一个包含111万图像-层-提示三元组的大型数据集，以及10万个经过人工精心挑选的高保真层。结合感知基础、人类偏好一致的自动评估协议，RefLade将RLD确立为一个定义明确且可基准化的研究任务。

Conclusion: 提出了一种名为RefLayer的简单基线，用于提示条件下的层分解，实现了高视觉保真度和语义对齐。实验表明，该方法能够实现有效的训练、可靠的评估和高质量的图像分解，同时展现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Precise, object-aware control over visual content is essential for advanced image editing and compositional generation. Yet, most existing approaches operate on entire images holistically, limiting the ability to isolate and manipulate individual scene elements. In contrast, layered representations, where scenes are explicitly separated into objects, environmental context, and visual effects, provide a more intuitive and structured framework for interpreting and editing visual content. To bridge this gap and enable both compositional understanding and controllable editing, we introduce the Referring Layer Decomposition (RLD) task, which predicts complete RGBA layers from a single RGB image, conditioned on flexible user prompts, such as spatial inputs (e.g., points, boxes, masks), natural language descriptions, or combinations thereof. At the core is the RefLade, a large-scale dataset comprising 1.11M image-layer-prompt triplets produced by our scalable data engine, along with 100K manually curated, high-fidelity layers. Coupled with a perceptually grounded, human-preference-aligned automatic evaluation protocol, RefLade establishes RLD as a well-defined and benchmarkable research task. Building on this foundation, we present RefLayer, a simple baseline designed for prompt-conditioned layer decomposition, achieving high visual fidelity and semantic alignment. Extensive experiments show our approach enables effective training, reliable evaluation, and high-quality image decomposition, while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的方法来解决视频喉镜检查中的声门开口定位问题，该方法在紧急插管视频中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视频喉镜检查中，由于快速组织变形、遮挡和紧急情况下的视觉模糊，时间稳定性在声门开口定位中仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了一种名为Closed-Loop Memory Correction (CL-MC)的检测器-循环框架，该框架通过置信度对齐的状态决策和主动记忆校正来监督Segment Anything Model 2(SAM2)。

Result: 在紧急插管视频中，CL-MC实现了最先进的性能，与SAM2变体和开环方法相比，显著降低了漂移和缺失率。

Conclusion: 内存校正被确立为可靠临床视频跟踪的关键组件。

Abstract: Temporal stability in glottic opening localization remains challenging due to the complementary weaknesses of single-frame detectors and foundation-model trackers: the former lacks temporal context, while the latter suffers from memory drift. Specifically, in video laryngoscopy, rapid tissue deformation, occlusions, and visual ambiguities in emergency settings require a robust, temporally aware solution that can prevent progressive tracking errors. We propose Closed-Loop Memory Correction (CL-MC), a detector-in-the-loop framework that supervises Segment Anything Model 2(SAM2) through confidence-aligned state decisions and active memory rectification. High-confidence detections trigger semantic resets that overwrite corrupted tracker memory, effectively mitigating drift accumulation with a training-free foundation tracker in complex endoscopic scenes. On emergency intubation videos, CL-MC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing drift and missing rate compared with the SAM2 variants and open loop based methods. Our results establish memory correction as a crucial component for reliable clinical video tracking. Our code will be available in https://github.com/huayuww/CL-MR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 阶梯池化方法提高了U-Net在生物医学图像分割中的性能，减少了信息损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的下采样技术虽然提高了计算效率，但牺牲了信息保留，导致U-Net在捕捉长距离信息时表现不佳。

Method: 采用阶梯池化方法，修改了2D池化步骤中的维度缩减比例，并通过选择最优下采样路径来减少信息损失。

Result: 实验表明，阶梯池化方法在三个生物医学图像分割基准上提高了U-Net的性能，并且通过转移熵量化了信息损失减少的情况。

Conclusion: 提出的阶梯池化（Stair Pooling）方法能够提高U-Net在生物医学图像分割中的性能，平均提高了3.8%的Dice分数，并且减少了信息损失。

Abstract: U-Net architectures have been instrumental in advancing biomedical image segmentation (BIS) but often struggle with capturing long-range information. One reason is the conventional down-sampling techniques that prioritize computational efficiency at the expense of information retention. This paper introduces a simple but effective strategy, we call it Stair Pooling, which moderates the pace of down-sampling and reduces information loss by leveraging a sequence of concatenated small and narrow pooling operations in varied orientations. Specifically, our method modifies the reduction in dimensionality within each 2D pooling step from $\frac{1}{4}$ to $\frac{1}{2}$. This approach can also be adapted for 3D pooling to preserve even more information. Such preservation aids the U-Net in more effectively reconstructing spatial details during the up-sampling phase, thereby enhancing its ability to capture long-range information and improving segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments on three BIS benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Stair Pooling can increase both 2D and 3D U-Net performance by an average of 3.8\% in Dice scores. Moreover, we leverage the transfer entropy to select the optimal down-sampling paths and quantitatively show how the proposed Stair Pooling reduces the information loss.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PA-Attack：针对LVLMs提出的新攻击方法，有效降低模型得分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）易受对抗攻击的问题，提出新的攻击方法。

Method: 提出PA-Attack（原型锚定注意力攻击），包含原型锚定指导和两阶段注意力增强机制。

Result: PA-Attack在多个下游任务和LVLM架构上实现了平均75.1%的得分降低率（SRR），表现出强大的攻击效果、效率和任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: PA-Attack是LVLMs中一种有效的对抗攻击方法。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are foundational to modern multimodal applications, yet their susceptibility to adversarial attacks remains a critical concern. Prior white-box attacks rarely generalize across tasks, and black-box methods depend on expensive transfer, which limits efficiency. The vision encoder, standardized and often shared across LVLMs, provides a stable gray-box pivot with strong cross-model transfer. Building on this premise, we introduce PA-Attack (Prototype-Anchored Attentive Attack). PA-Attack begins with a prototype-anchored guidance that provides a stable attack direction towards a general and dissimilar prototype, tackling the attribute-restricted issue and limited task generalization of vanilla attacks. Building on this, we propose a two-stage attention enhancement mechanism: (i) leverage token-level attention scores to concentrate perturbations on critical visual tokens, and (ii) adaptively recalibrate attention weights to track the evolving attention during the adversarial process. Extensive experiments across diverse downstream tasks and LVLM architectures show that PA-Attack achieves an average 75.1% score reduction rate (SRR), demonstrating strong attack effectiveness, efficiency, and task generalization in LVLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hefeimei06/PA-Attack.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prefer-DAS模型通过结合自我训练和提示引导的对比学习，在细胞结构分割任务上表现出优异的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了从各种大型电子显微镜（EM）中分割细胞结构，同时避免在每个领域产生大量标注数据。

Method: 开发了一个名为Prefer-DAS的模型，它结合了自我训练和提示引导的对比学习，并引入了局部直接偏好优化（LPO）和稀疏LPO（SLPO）。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的DAS任务上进行了全面实验，结果表明该模型在自动和交互式分割模式下的性能均优于SAM-like方法以及无监督和弱监督DAS方法，同时其性能与监督模型非常接近或甚至更好。

Conclusion: Prefer-DAS模型在弱监督和未监督的DAS任务上表现出色，具有很好的泛化能力和灵活性。

Abstract: Domain adaptive segmentation (DAS) is a promising paradigm for delineating intracellular structures from various large-scale electron microscopy (EM) without incurring extensive annotated data in each domain. However, the prevalent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) strategies often demonstrate limited and biased performance, which hinders their practical applications. In this study, we explore sparse points and local human preferences as weak labels in the target domain, thereby presenting a more realistic yet annotation-efficient setting. Specifically, we develop Prefer-DAS, which pioneers sparse promptable learning and local preference alignment. The Prefer-DAS is a promptable multitask model that integrates self-training and prompt-guided contrastive learning. Unlike SAM-like methods, the Prefer-DAS allows for the use of full, partial, and even no point prompts during both training and inference stages and thus enables interactive segmentation. Instead of using image-level human preference alignment for segmentation, we introduce Local direct Preference Optimization (LPO) and sparse LPO (SLPO), plug-and-play solutions for alignment with spatially varying human feedback or sparse feedback. To address potential missing feedback, we also introduce Unsupervised Preference Optimization (UPO), which leverages self-learned preferences. As a result, the Prefer-DAS model can effectively perform both weakly-supervised and unsupervised DAS, depending on the availability of points and human preferences. Comprehensive experiments on four challenging DAS tasks demonstrate that our model outperforms SAM-like methods as well as unsupervised and weakly-supervised DAS methods in both automatic and interactive segmentation modes, highlighting strong generalizability and flexibility. Additionally, the performance of our model is very close to or even exceeds that of supervised models.

Motivation: 提高肝细胞癌诊断的准确性

Method: 提出了一种名为 Hepato-LLaVA 的多模态大型语言模型，用于细粒度的肝细胞病理分析，并引入了一种新的稀疏拓扑包注意机制。此外，还提出了 HepatoPathoVQA 数据集，包含 33K 个由专家病理学家验证的层次结构化问答对。

Result: Hepato-LLaVA 在 HCC 诊断和字幕任务上取得了最先进的性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Hepato-LLaVA 是一种有效的肝细胞癌诊断工具，具有显著的性能优势。

Abstract: Hepatocellular Carcinoma diagnosis relies heavily on the interpretation of gigapixel Whole Slide Images. However, current computational approaches are constrained by fixed-resolution processing mechanisms and inefficient feature aggregation, which inevitably lead to either severe information loss or high feature redundancy. To address these challenges, we propose Hepato-LLaVA, a specialized Multi-modal Large Language Model designed for fine-grained hepatocellular pathology analysis. We introduce a novel Sparse Topo-Pack Attention mechanism that explicitly models 2D tissue topology. This mechanism effectively aggregates local diagnostic evidence into semantic summary tokens while preserving global context. Furthermore, to overcome the lack of multi-scale data, we present HepatoPathoVQA, a clinically grounded dataset comprising 33K hierarchically structured question-answer pairs validated by expert pathologists. Our experiments demonstrate that Hepato-LLaVA achieves state-of-the-art performance on HCC diagnosis and captioning tasks, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TherA是一种新的RGB到TIR转换框架，通过结合TherA-VLM和基于潜在扩散的转换器，实现了逼真的TIR图像合成，并在零样本翻译性能上取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于热红外成像（TIR）的固有优势，大规模数据收集和标注仍然是TIR感知的一个主要瓶颈。一种实用的替代方案是通过图像转换生成伪TIR数据。然而，大多数RGB到TIR的方法过度依赖RGB中心化的先验，忽略了热物理，导致不合理的热量分布。

Method: 本文介绍了TherA，这是一个可控的RGB到TIR转换框架，能够在场景和对象级别产生多样化和热物理上合理的图像。TherA将TherA-VLM与基于潜在扩散的转换器相结合。给定单个RGB图像和用户提示的条件对，TherA-VLM产生一个热感知嵌入，该嵌入编码场景、对象、材料和热辐射上下文，反映了输入的场景-条件对。在扩散模型上对嵌入进行条件化，可以实现逼真的TIR合成和对一天中不同时间、天气和对象状态的精细控制。

Result: 与其他基线相比，TherA在翻译性能上达到了最先进的水平，平均所有指标提高了33%的零样本翻译性能。

Conclusion: TherA框架在RGB到TIR转换方面取得了显著成果，为TIR感知提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the inherent advantages of thermal infrared(TIR) imaging, large-scale data collection and annotation remain a major bottleneck for TIR-based perception. A practical alternative is to synthesize pseudo TIR data via image translation; however, most RGB-to-TIR approaches heavily rely on RGB-centric priors that overlook thermal physics, yielding implausible heat distributions. In this paper, we introduce TherA, a controllable RGB-to-TIR translation framework that produces diverse and thermally plausible images at both scene and object level. TherA couples TherA-VLM with a latent-diffusion-based translator. Given a single RGB image and a user-prompted condition pair, TherA-VLM yields a thermal-aware embedding that encodes scene, object, material, and heat-emission context reflecting the input scene-condition pair. Conditioning the diffusion model on this embedding enables realistic TIR synthesis and fine-grained control across time of day, weather, and object state. Compared to other baselines, TherA achieves state-of-the-art translation performance, demonstrating improved zero-shot translation performance up to 33% increase averaged across all metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有基于提示的方法无法明确排除视觉相似干扰物的关键局限性，提出CountEx框架。

Method: CountEx框架通过多模态提示（包括自然语言描述和可选视觉示例）允许用户表达包含和排除意图，核心是判别查询细化模块，通过识别共享视觉特征、隔离排除特定模式并应用选择性抑制来细化计数查询。

Result: CountEx在已知和未知类别对象的计数任务上实现了对现有方法的实质性改进。

Conclusion: CountEx是一种有效的视觉计数框架，能够提高计数准确性。

Abstract: This paper presents CountEx, a discriminative visual counting framework designed to address a key limitation of existing prompt-based methods: the inability to explicitly exclude visually similar distractors. While current approaches allow users to specify what to count via inclusion prompts, they often struggle in cluttered scenes with confusable object categories, leading to ambiguity and overcounting. CountEx enables users to express both inclusion and exclusion intent, specifying what to count and what to ignore, through multimodal prompts including natural language descriptions and optional visual exemplars. At the core of CountEx is a novel Discriminative Query Refinement module, which jointly reasons over inclusion and exclusion cues by first identifying shared visual features, then isolating exclusion-specific patterns, and finally applying selective suppression to refine the counting query. To support systematic evaluation of fine-grained counting methods, we introduce CoCount, a benchmark comprising 1,780 videos and 10,086 annotated frames across 97 category pairs. Experiments show that CountEx achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods for counting objects from both known and novel categories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FinSight-Net：一种高效且物理感知的水下鱼类检测框架，在复杂水产养殖环境中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下鱼类检测（UFD）对于智能水产养殖和海洋生态监测至关重要。然而，现有的检测器在提高准确性的同时，往往增加了计算负担，并且忽略了UFD的基本限制因素：波长相关的吸收和浑浊引起的散射会显著降低对比度，模糊细微结构，并引入后向散射噪声，导致定位和识别不可靠。

Method: 提出了FinSight-Net，一个针对复杂水产养殖环境的有效且具有物理感知的检测框架。FinSight-Net引入了多尺度解耦双流处理（MS-DDSP）瓶颈，通过异构卷积分支明确针对特定频率的信息损失，抑制后向散射伪影，并通过尺度感知和通道加权路径补偿扭曲的生物线索。此外，还设计了一种高效路径聚合FPN（EPA-FPN）作为细节填充机制：通过建立长距离跳跃连接和剪枝冗余融合路径，恢复深层中通常衰减的高频空间信息，从而在严重模糊和浑浊的情况下实现非刚性鱼类目标的鲁棒检测。

Result: 在DeepFish、AquaFishSet和UW-BlurredFish基准上进行了大量实验，表明FinSight-Net达到了最先进的性能。特别是在UW-BlurredFish上，FinSight-Net达到了92.8%的mAP，比YOLOv11s高4.8%，同时减少了29.0%的参数，为智能水产养殖中的实时自动化监测提供了一个强大且轻量级的解决方案。

Conclusion: FinSight-Net是一个有效的物理感知检测框架，能够实现水下鱼类检测的高精度和低计算成本。

Abstract: Underwater fish detection (UFD) is a core capability for smart aquaculture and marine ecological monitoring. While recent detectors improve accuracy by stacking feature extractors or introducing heavy attention modules, they often incur substantial computational overhead and, more importantly, neglect the physics that fundamentally limits UFD: wavelength-dependent absorption and turbidity-induced scattering significantly degrade contrast, blur fine structures, and introduce backscattering noise, leading to unreliable localization and recognition. To address these challenges, we propose FinSight-Net, an efficient and physics-aware detection framework tailored for complex aquaculture environments. FinSight-Net introduces a Multi-Scale Decoupled Dual-Stream Processing (MS-DDSP) bottleneck that explicitly targets frequency-specific information loss via heterogeneous convolutional branches, suppressing backscattering artifacts while compensating distorted biological cues through scale-aware and channel-weighted pathways. We further design an Efficient Path Aggregation FPN (EPA-FPN) as a detail-filling mechanism: it restores high-frequency spatial information typically attenuated in deep layers by establishing long-range skip connections and pruning redundant fusion routes, enabling robust detection of non-rigid fish targets under severe blur and turbidity. Extensive experiments on DeepFish, AquaFishSet, and our challenging UW-BlurredFish benchmark demonstrate that FinSight-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance. In particular, on UW-BlurredFish, FinSight-Net reaches 92.8% mAP, outperforming YOLOv11s by 4.8% while reducing parameters by 29.0%, providing a strong and lightweight solution for real-time automated monitoring in smart aquaculture.

Method: 提出了一种无需训练的后期概念瓶颈管道，包括三个紧密耦合的阶段：概念挖掘、多智能体结构评分和几何校准，通过端到端维度优化循环统一。

Result: 在UrbanAlign中应用于城市感知，该框架在Place Pulse 2.0的六个类别上实现了72.2%的准确率（$κ=0.45$），优于最佳监督基线+15.1个百分点，优于未校准的VLM评分+16.3个百分点，具有完整的维度级可解释性和零模型权重修改。

Conclusion: 对于主观感知任务，无需模型训练即可实现对齐，VLM是强大的概念提取器但较差的决策校准器，差距可以通过外部方法弥补。

Abstract: Aligning vision-language model (VLM) outputs with human preferences in domain-specific tasks typically requires fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, both of which demand labelled data and GPU compute. We show that for subjective perception tasks, this alignment can be achieved without any model training: VLMs are already strong concept extractors but poor decision calibrators, and the gap can be closed externally. We propose a training-free post-hoc concept-bottleneck pipeline consisting of three tightly coupled stages: concept mining, multi-agent structured scoring, and geometric calibration, unified by an end-to-end dimension optimization loop. Interpretable evaluation dimensions are mined from a handful of human annotations; an Observer-Debater-Judge chain extracts robust continuous concept scores from a frozen VLM; and locally-weighted ridge regression on a hybrid visual-semantic manifold calibrates these scores against human ratings. Applied to urban perception as UrbanAlign, the framework achieves 72.2% accuracy ($κ=0.45$) on Place Pulse 2.0 across six categories, outperforming the best supervised baseline by +15.1 pp and uncalibrated VLM scoring by +16.3 pp, with full dimension-level interpretability and zero model-weight modification.

Motivation: 现有方法在特定领域的视觉任务中表现不佳，导致推理错误。

Method: CRAFT（代码本调节微调），使用离散代码本微调编码器，实现领域适应性。

Result: 在10个特定领域基准测试中平均提升13.51%，优于使用连续令牌的方法。

Conclusion: CRAFT实现了编码器和语言模型的解耦，提高了LVLMs的性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) use their vision encoders to translate images into representations for downstream reasoning, but the encoders often underperform in domain-specific visual tasks such as medical image diagnosis or fine-grained classification, where representation errors can cascade through the language model, leading to incorrect responses. Existing adaptation methods modify the continuous feature interface between encoder and language model through projector tuning or other parameter-efficient updates, which still couples the two components and requires re-alignment whenever the encoder changes. We introduce CRAFT (Codebook RegulAted Fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that fine-tunes the encoder using a discrete codebook that anchors visual representations to a stable token space, achieving domain adaptation without modifying other parts of the model. This decoupled design allows the adapted encoder to seamlessly boost the performance of LVLMs with different language architectures, as long as they share the same codebook. Empirically, CRAFT achieves an average gain of 13.51% across 10 domain-specific benchmarks such as VQARAD and PlantVillage, while preserving the LLM's linguistic capabilities and outperforming peer methods that operate on continuous tokens.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种新的TTA方法，通过显式假设选择解决安全自适应权衡，提高了安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全性至关重要的医疗分割中，标准测试时自适应（TTA）方法通常将推理视为一个盲优化任务，将通用的目标应用于所有或筛选后的测试样本。这种缺乏选择性通常会导致肿瘤掩码溢出到健康脑组织，或者降低已经正确的预测。

Method: 我们提出了假设驱动的TTA，这是一个新颖的框架，将自适应重新定义为动态决策过程。我们的方法不是强制一个单一的优化轨迹，而是生成直观的竞争几何假设：压缩（预测是否噪声？修剪伪影）与膨胀（有效的肿瘤是否被欠分割？安全膨胀以恢复）。然后，它使用表示引导的选择器来自主地根据内在纹理一致性识别最安全的输出。此外，一个预筛选的守门人通过跳过对自信案例的自适应来防止负面迁移。

Result: 在跨域二进制脑肿瘤分割任务上验证了这个概念验证，将源模型应用于成人BraTS胶质瘤的未见过的儿科和更具挑战性的脑膜瘤目标域。HD-TTA在具有挑战性的安全环境中，在几个最先进的代表性基线中提高了以安全性为导向的结果（Hausdorff距离（HD95）和精确度），HD95降低了约6.4毫米，精确度提高了4%以上，同时保持了可比的Dice分数。这些结果表明，通过显式假设选择解决安全自适应权衡是一个可行的、稳健的安全临床模型部署途径。

Conclusion: 通过显式假设选择解决安全自适应权衡是一个可行的、稳健的安全临床模型部署途径。

Abstract: Standard Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods typically treat inference as a blind optimization task, applying generic objectives to all or filtered test samples. In safety-critical medical segmentation, this lack of selectivity often causes the tumor mask to spill into healthy brain tissue or degrades predictions that were already correct. We propose Hypothesis-Driven TTA, a novel framework that reformulates adaptation as a dynamic decision process. Rather than forcing a single optimization trajectory, our method generates intuitive competing geometric hypotheses: compaction (is the prediction noisy? trim artifacts) versus inflation (is the valid tumor under-segmented? safely inflate to recover). It then employs a representation-guided selector to autonomously identify the safest outcome based on intrinsic texture consistency. Additionally, a pre-screening Gatekeeper prevents negative transfer by skipping adaptation on confident cases. We validate this proof-of-concept on a cross-domain binary brain tumor segmentation task, applying a source model trained on adult BraTS gliomas to unseen pediatric and more challenging meningioma target domains. HD-TTA improves safety-oriented outcomes (Hausdorff Distance (HD95) and Precision) over several state-of-the-art representative baselines in the challenging safety regime, reducing the HD95 by approximately 6.4 mm and improving Precision by over 4%, while maintaining comparable Dice scores. These results demonstrate that resolving the safety-adaptation trade-off via explicit hypothesis selection is a viable, robust path for safe clinical model deployment. Code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Result: 在CelebA-HQ和ImageNet上进行大量实验，证明了该方法在样本质量、GFLOPs和推理速度方面优于单尺度和多尺度流匹配基线。模型适用于高分辨率生成（高达1024x1024），同时保持较低的计算开销

Conclusion: LapFlow是一种有效的图像生成模型，通过多尺度架构提高了样本质量和效率

Abstract: In this paper, we present Laplacian multiscale flow matching (LapFlow), a novel framework that enhances flow matching by leveraging multi-scale representations for image generative modeling. Our approach decomposes images into Laplacian pyramid residuals and processes different scales in parallel through a mixture-of-transformers (MoT) architecture with causal attention mechanisms. Unlike previous cascaded approaches that require explicit renoising between scales, our model generates multi-scale representations in parallel, eliminating the need for bridging processes. The proposed multi-scale architecture not only improves generation quality but also accelerates the sampling process and promotes scaling flow matching methods. Through extensive experimentation on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet, we demonstrate that our method achieves superior sample quality with fewer GFLOPs and faster inference compared to single-scale and multi-scale flow matching baselines. The proposed model scales effectively to high-resolution generation (up to 1024$\times$1024) while maintaining lower computational overhead.

Abstract: 3D imaging of specular surfaces remains challenging in real-world scenarios, such as in-line inspection or hand-held scanning, requiring fast and accurate measurement of complex geometries. Optical metrology techniques such as deflectometry achieve high accuracy but typically rely on multi-shot acquisition, making them unsuitable for dynamic environments. Fourier-based single-shot approaches alleviate this constraint, yet their performance deteriorates when measuring surfaces with high spatial frequency structure or large curvature. Alternatively, polarimetric 3D imaging in computer vision operates in a single-shot fashion and exhibits robustness to geometric complexity. However, its accuracy is fundamentally limited by the orthographic imaging assumption. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework for single-shot 3D imaging of complex specular surfaces. Polarization cues provide orientation priors that assist in interpreting geometric information encoded by structured illumination. These complementary cues are processed through a dual-encoder architecture with mutual feature modulation, allowing the network to resolve their nonlinear coupling and directly infer surface normals. The proposed method achieves accurate and robust normal estimation in single-shot with fast inference, enabling practical 3D imaging of complex specular surfaces.

Result: FRLA方法在眼底图像诊断的SFDA中取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 我们的方法不仅显著优于视觉语言模型，而且在性能上始终优于现有方法。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a model trained in the source domain to perform well in the target domain, with only unlabeled target domain data and the source model. Taking into account that conventional SFDA methods are inevitably error-prone under domain shift, recently greater attention has been directed to SFDA assisted with off-the-shelf foundation models, e.g., vision-language (ViL) models. However, existing works of leveraging ViL models for SFDA confront two issues: (i) Although mutual information is exploited to consider the joint distribution between the predictions of ViL model and the target model, we argue that the forgetting of some superior predictions of the target model still occurs, as indicated by the decline of the accuracies of certain classes during adaptation; (ii) Prior research disregards the rich, fine-grained knowledge embedded in the ViL model, which offers detailed grounding for fundus image diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce a novel forgetting-resistant and lesion-aware (FRLA) method for SFDA of fundus image diagnosis with ViL model. Specifically, a forgetting-resistant adaptation module explicitly preserves the confident predictions of the target model, and a lesion-aware adaptation module yields patch-wise predictions from ViL model and employs them to help the target model be aware of the lesion areas and leverage the ViL model's fine-grained knowledge. Extensive experiments show that our method not only significantly outperforms the vision-language model, but also achieves consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be released.

TL;DR: Proposed framework improves whole slide image analysis for disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whole slide images are crucial for precise disease diagnosis, but their analysis is difficult due to large data size and sparse annotations.

Method: Propose a spatially regularized MIL framework that leverages inherent spatial relationships among patch features as label-independent regularization signals.

Result: Significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, offering a promising direction.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses the challenges of whole slide image analysis by using spatial regularization and improves the accuracy of disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Whole slide images, with their gigapixel-scale panoramas of tissue samples, are pivotal for precise disease diagnosis. However, their analysis is hindered by immense data size and scarce annotations. Existing MIL methods face challenges due to the fundamental imbalance where a single bag-level label must guide the learning of numerous patch-level features. This sparse supervision makes it difficult to reliably identify discriminative patches during training, leading to unstable optimization and suboptimal solutions. We propose a spatially regularized MIL framework that leverages inherent spatial relationships among patch features as label-independent regularization signals. Our approach learns a shared representation space by jointly optimizing feature-induced spatial reconstruction and label-guided classification objectives, enforcing consistency between intrinsic structural patterns and supervisory signals. Experimental results on multiple public datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, offering a promising direction.

Result: 实验结果表明MICON-Bench在揭示多图像推理挑战方面的严谨性和DAR在提高生成质量和跨图像连贯性方面的有效性。

Conclusion: MICON-Bench和DAR对于提升多图像理解与生成能力具有重要意义。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have enabled remarkable image understanding and generation capabilities. However, while models like Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image show emerging abilities to reason over multiple related images, existing benchmarks rarely address the challenges of multi-image context generation, focusing mainly on text-to-image or single-image editing tasks. In this work, we introduce \textbf{MICON-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark covering six tasks that evaluate cross-image composition, contextual reasoning, and identity preservation. We further propose an MLLM-driven Evaluation-by-Checkpoint framework for automatic verification of semantic and visual consistency, where multimodal large language model (MLLM) serves as a verifier. Additionally, we present \textbf{Dynamic Attention Rebalancing (DAR)}, a training-free, plug-and-play mechanism that dynamically adjusts attention during inference to enhance coherence and reduce hallucinations. Extensive experiments on various state-of-the-art open-source models demonstrate both the rigor of MICON-Bench in exposing multi-image reasoning challenges and the efficacy of DAR in improving generation quality and cross-image coherence.

Conclusion: ControlMLLM++是一种有效的测试时自适应框架，可以增强MLLMs的视觉推理能力，同时保持模型的可解释性和泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose ControlMLLM++, a novel test-time adaptation framework that injects learnable visual prompts into frozen multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enable fine-grained region-based visual reasoning without any model retraining or fine-tuning. Leveraging the insight that cross-modal attention maps intrinsically encode semantic correspondences between textual tokens and visual regions, ControlMLLM++ optimizes a latent visual token modifier during inference via a task-specific energy function to steer model attention towards user-specified areas. To enhance optimization stability and mitigate language prompt biases, ControlMLLM++ incorporates an improved optimization strategy (Optim++) and a prompt debiasing mechanism (PromptDebias). Supporting diverse visual prompt types including bounding boxes, masks, scribbles, and points, our method demonstrates strong out-of-domain generalization and interpretability.

Method: 特征缓存方法，关系特征缓存（RFC）

Result: RFC在DiT模型上显著优于先前方法

Conclusion: RFC通过利用输入输出关系提高了特征预测的准确性，并减少了预测误差

Abstract: Feature caching approaches accelerate diffusion transformers (DiTs) by storing the output features of computationally expensive modules at certain timesteps, and exploiting them for subsequent steps to reduce redundant computations. Recent forecasting-based caching approaches employ temporal extrapolation techniques to approximate the output features with cached ones. Although effective, relying exclusively on temporal extrapolation still suffers from significant prediction errors, leading to performance degradation. Through a detailed analysis, we find that 1) these errors stem from the irregular magnitude of changes in the output features, and 2) an input feature of a module is strongly correlated with the corresponding output. Based on this, we propose relational feature caching (RFC), a novel framework that leverages the input-output relationship to enhance the accuracy of the feature prediction. Specifically, we introduce relational feature estimation (RFE) to estimate the magnitude of changes in the output features from the inputs, enabling more accurate feature predictions. We also present relational cache scheduling (RCS), which estimates the prediction errors using the input features and performs full computations only when the errors are expected to be substantial. Extensive experiments across various DiT models demonstrate that RFC consistently outperforms prior approaches significantly. Project page is available at https://cvlab.yonsei.ac.kr/projects/RFC

Method: 提出了一种两阶段策略，第一阶段使用高保真度方法生成合理的前景形状，作为第二阶段高保真度方法的条件。

Result: 在MureCOM数据集上的实验验证了该两阶段策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的方法能够同时实现前景物体与背景的合理融合和细节的准确保留。

Abstract: Generative image composition aims to regenerate the given foreground object in the background image to produce a realistic composite image. Some high-authenticity methods can adjust foreground pose/view to be compatible with background, while some high-fidelity methods can preserve the foreground details accurately. However, existing methods can hardly achieve both goals at the same time. In this work, we propose a two-stage strategy to achieve both goals. In the first stage, we use high-authenticity method to generate reasonable foreground shape, serving as the condition of high-fidelity method in the second stage. The experiments on MureCOM dataset verify the effectiveness of our two-stage strategy. The code and model have been released at https://github.com/bcmi/OSInsert-Image-Composition.

Abstract: This work proposes a green learning (GL) approach to restore medical images. Without loss of generality, we use low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) images as examples. LDCT images are susceptible to noise and artifacts, where the imaging process introduces distortion. LDCT image restoration is an important preprocessing step for further medical analysis. Deep learning (DL) methods have been developed to solve this problem. We examine an alternative solution using the Green Learning (GL) methodology. The new restoration method is characterized by mathematical transparency, computational and memory efficiency, and high performance. Experiments show that our GL method offers state-of-the-art restoration performance at a smaller model size and with lower inference complexity.

Motivation: Articulated object pose estimation is a core task in embodied AI, but existing methods struggle with navigating a large, complex search space and incorporating intrinsic kinematic constraints.

Method: DICArt (DIsCrete Diffusion for Articulation Pose Estimation) formulates pose estimation as a conditional discrete diffusion process, proposes a flexible flow decider, and incorporates a hierarchical kinematic coupling strategy.

Result: DICArt demonstrates superior performance and robustness on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DICArt offers a new paradigm for reliable category-level 6D pose estimation in complex environments.

Abstract: Articulated object pose estimation is a core task in embodied AI. Existing methods typically regress poses in a continuous space, but often struggle with 1) navigating a large, complex search space and 2) failing to incorporate intrinsic kinematic constraints. In this work, we introduce DICArt (DIsCrete Diffusion for Articulation Pose Estimation), a novel framework that formulates pose estimation as a conditional discrete diffusion process. Instead of operating in a continuous domain, DICArt progressively denoises a noisy pose representation through a learned reverse diffusion procedure to recover the GT pose. To improve modeling fidelity, we propose a flexible flow decider that dynamically determines whether each token should be denoised or reset, effectively balancing the real and noise distributions during diffusion. Additionally, we incorporate a hierarchical kinematic coupling strategy, estimating the pose of each rigid part hierarchically to respect the object's kinematic structure. We validate DICArt on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance and robustness. By integrating discrete generative modeling with structural priors, DICArt offers a new paradigm for reliable category-level 6D pose estimation in complex environments.

Method: 提出HOCA-Bench基准，将物理异常分为本体论异常和因果异常，并使用生成式视频模型作为对抗模拟器构建测试平台。

Result: 17个Video-LLMs在测试中表现出认知滞后，对因果机制的识别能力较弱，系统-2的“思考”模式可以提高推理能力，但无法缩小差距。

Conclusion: 当前架构更擅长识别视觉模式，而非应用基本物理定律。

Abstract: Video-LLMs have improved steadily on semantic perception, but they still fall short on predictive world modeling, which is central to physically grounded intelligence. We introduce HOCA-Bench, a benchmark that frames physical anomalies through a Hegelian lens. HOCA-Bench separates anomalies into two types: ontological anomalies, where an entity violates its own definition or persistence, and causal anomalies, where interactions violate physical relations. Using state-of-the-art generative video models as adversarial simulators, we build a testbed of 1,439 videos (3,470 QA pairs). Evaluations on 17 Video-LLMs show a clear cognitive lag: models often identify static ontological violations (e.g., shape mutations) but struggle with causal mechanisms (e.g., gravity or friction), with performance dropping by more than 20% on causal tasks. System-2 "Thinking" modes improve reasoning, but they do not close the gap, suggesting that current architectures recognize visual patterns more readily than they apply basic physical laws.

Conclusion: ConceptPrism框架通过自动解纠缠技术，在保持概念忠实度的同时提高了文本对齐，为个性化文本到图像生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation suffers from concept entanglement, where irrelevant residual information from reference images is captured, leading to a trade-off between concept fidelity and text alignment. Recent disentanglement approaches attempt to solve this utilizing manual guidance, such as linguistic cues or segmentation masks, which limits their applicability and fails to fully articulate the target concept. In this paper, we propose ConceptPrism, a novel framework that automatically disentangles the shared visual concept from image-specific residuals by comparing images within a set. Our method jointly optimizes a target token and image-wise residual tokens using two complementary objectives: a reconstruction loss to ensure fidelity, and a novel exclusion loss that compels residual tokens to discard the shared concept. This process allows the target token to capture the pure concept without direct supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConceptPrism effectively resolves concept entanglement, achieving a significantly improved trade-off between fidelity and alignment.

Conclusion: MVIG攻击框架有效提高了CP系统的安全性，为防御对抗攻击提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Collaborative perception (CP) enables data sharing among connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to enhance driving safety. However, CP systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks where malicious agents forge false objects via feature-level perturbations. Current defensive systems use threshold-based consensus verification by comparing collaborative and ego detection results. Yet, these defenses remain vulnerable to more sophisticated attack strategies that could exploit two critical weaknesses: (i) lack of robustness against attacks with systematic timing and target region optimization, and (ii) inadvertent disclosure of vulnerability knowledge through implicit confidence information in shared collaboration data. In this paper, we propose MVIG attack, a novel adaptive adversarial CP framework learning to capture vulnerability knowledge disclosed by different defensive CP systems from a unified mutual view information graph (MVIG) representation. Our approach combines MVIG representation with temporal graph learning to generate evolving fabrication risk maps and employs entropy-aware vulnerability search to optimize attack location, timing and persistence, enabling adaptive attacks with generalizability across various defensive configurations. Extensive evaluations on OPV2V and Adv-OPV2V datasets demonstrate that MVIG attack reduces defense success rates by up to 62\% against state-of-the-art defenses while achieving 47\% lower detection for persistent attacks at 29.9 FPS, exposing critical security gaps in CP systems.

Conclusion: CLCR方法有效地解决了多模态学习中的语义错位和错误传播问题，提高了表示质量，并在多个任务中表现出良好的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to capture both shared and private information from multiple modalities. However, existing methods that project all modalities into a single latent space for fusion often overlook the asynchronous, multi-level semantic structure of multimodal data. This oversight induces semantic misalignment and error propagation, thereby degrading representation quality. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Level Co-Representation (CLCR), which explicitly organizes each modality's features into a three-level semantic hierarchy and specifies level-wise constraints for cross-modal interactions. First, a semantic hierarchy encoder aligns shallow, mid, and deep features across modalities, establishing a common basis for interaction. And then, at each level, an Intra-Level Co-Exchange Domain (IntraCED) factorizes features into shared and private subspaces and restricts cross-modal attention to the shared subspace via a learnable token budget. This design ensures that only shared semantics are exchanged and prevents leakage from private channels. To integrate information across levels, the Inter-Level Co-Aggregation Domain (InterCAD) synchronizes semantic scales using learned anchors, selectively fuses the shared representations, and gates private cues to form a compact task representation. We further introduce regularization terms to enforce separation of shared and private features and to minimize cross-level interference. Experiments on six benchmarks spanning emotion recognition, event localization, sentiment analysis, and action recognition show that CLCR achieves strong performance and generalizes well across tasks.

Abstract: Looting at archaeological sites poses a severe risk to cultural heritage, yet monitoring thousands of remote locations remains operationally difficult. We present a scalable and satellite-based pipeline to detect looted archaeological sites, using PlanetScope monthly mosaics (4.7m/pixel) and a curated dataset of 1,943 archaeological sites in Afghanistan (898 looted, 1,045 preserved) with multi-year imagery (2016--2023) and site-footprint masks. We compare (i) end-to-end CNN classifiers trained on raw RGB patches and (ii) traditional machine learning (ML) trained on handcrafted spectral/texture features and embeddings from recent remote-sensing foundation models. Results indicate that ImageNet-pretrained CNNs combined with spatial masking reach an F1 score of 0.926, clearly surpassing the strongest traditional ML setup, which attains an F1 score of 0.710 using SatCLIP-V+RF+Mean, i.e., location and vision embeddings fed into a Random Forest with mean-based temporal aggregation. Ablation studies demonstrate that ImageNet pretraining (even in the presence of domain shift) and spatial masking enhance performance. In contrast, geospatial foundation model embeddings perform competitively with handcrafted features, suggesting that looting signatures are extremely localized.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in broad visual understanding, yet they remain challenged by object-centric reasoning on rare objects due to the scarcity of such instances in pretraining data. While prior efforts alleviate this issue by retrieving additional data or introducing stronger vision encoders, these methods are still computationally intensive during finetuning VLMs and don't fully exploit the original training data. In this paper, we introduce an efficient plug-and-play module that substantially improves VLMs' reasoning over rare objects by refining visual tokens and enriching input text prompts, without VLMs finetuning. Specifically, we propose to learn multi-modal class embeddings for rare objects by leveraging prior knowledge from vision foundation models and synonym-augmented text descriptions, compensating for limited training examples. These embeddings refine the visual tokens in VLMs through a lightweight attention-based enhancement module that improves fine-grained object details. In addition, we use the learned embeddings as object-aware detectors to generate informative hints, which are injected into the text prompts to help guide the VLM's attention toward relevant image regions. Experiments on two benchmarks show consistent and substantial gains for pretrained VLMs in rare object recognition and reasoning. Further analysis reveals how our method strengthens the VLM's ability to focus on and reason about rare objects.

Moving away from traditional "one-shot" generation, PedaCo-Gen introduces an Intermediate Representation (IR) phase, enabling educators to interactively review and refine video blueprints-comprising scripts and visual descriptions-with an AI reviewer. Our study with 23 education experts demonstrates that PedaCo-Gen significantly enhances video quality across various topics and CTML principles compared to baselines. Participants perceived the AI-driven guidance not merely as a set of instructions but as a metacognitive scaffold that augmented their instructional design expertise, reporting high production efficiency (M=4.26) and guide validity (M=4.04). These findings highlight the importance of reclaiming pedagogical agency through principled co-creation, providing a foundation for future AI authoring tools that harmonize generative power with human professional expertise.

Motivation: 提出SAM-H和WOFTSAM两种新的平面跟踪器，以提高跟踪的鲁棒性和准确性。

Method: 结合SAM 2的鲁棒长期分割跟踪和8自由度的单应性姿态估计。SAM-H从分割掩码轮廓估计单应性，WOFTSAM利用SAM-H提供的丢失目标重新检测来改进WOFT。

Result: 在POT-210和PlanarTrack跟踪基准上进行了评估，在后者上，它们在p@15指标上比第二好的方法分别提高了12.4和15.2个百分点。还提供了改进的初始PlanarTrack姿态的地面实况注释，使高精度的p@5指标基准评估更加准确。

Conclusion: SAM-H和WOFTSAM在平面跟踪方面取得了新的突破，提高了跟踪性能和基准测试的准确性。

Abstract: We present SAM-H and WOFTSAM, novel planar trackers that combine robust long-term segmentation tracking provided by SAM 2 with 8 degrees-of-freedom homography pose estimation. SAM-H estimates homographies from segmentation mask contours and is thus highly robust to target appearance changes. WOFTSAM significantly improves the current state-of-the-art planar tracker WOFT by exploiting lost target re-detection provided by SAM-H. The proposed methods are evaluated on POT-210 and PlanarTrack tracking benchmarks, setting the new state-of-the-art performance on both. On the latter, they outperform the second best by a large margin, +12.4 and +15.2pp on the p@15 metric. We also present improved ground-truth annotations of initial PlanarTrack poses, enabling more accurate benchmarking in the high-precision p@5 metric.

Motivation: 为了减轻文本到图像扩散模型在合成有害、私人或受版权保护的内容方面的潜在滥用风险

Method: 提出了一种名为High-Level Representation Misdirection（HiRM）的新方法，该方法通过误导文本编码器中目标概念的高级语义表示来抑制目标概念，同时只更新包含视觉属性因果状态的早期层

Result: 在UnlearnCanvas和NSFW基准上取得了强大的结果，在多样化的目标（如物体、风格、裸露）上实现了精确的概念去除，同时保持了低训练成本和生成效用，且可以迁移到最先进的架构如Flux，并表现出与基于去噪器概念去除方法的协同效应

Conclusion: HiRM是一种有效的概念擦除技术，能够精确地去除目标概念，同时对无关概念的影响最小，并具有广泛的适用性和较低的培训成本

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have seen rapid and widespread adoption. However, their powerful generative capabilities raise concerns about potential misuse for synthesizing harmful, private, or copyrighted content. To mitigate such risks, concept erasure techniques have emerged as a promising solution. Prior works have primarily focused on fine-tuning the denoising component (e.g., the U-Net backbone). However, recent causal tracing studies suggest that visual attribute information is localized in the early self-attention layers of the text encoder, indicating a potential alternative for concept erasing. Building on this insight, we conduct preliminary experiments and find that directly fine-tuning early layers can suppress target concepts but often degrades the generation quality of non-target concepts. To overcome this limitation, we propose High-Level Representation Misdirection (HiRM), which misdirects high-level semantic representations of target concepts in the text encoder toward designated vectors such as random directions or semantically defined directions (e.g., supercategories), while updating only early layers that contain causal states of visual attributes. Our decoupling strategy enables precise concept removal with minimal impact on unrelated concepts, as demonstrated by strong results on UnlearnCanvas and NSFW benchmarks across diverse targets (e.g., objects, styles, nudity). HiRM also preserves generative utility at low training cost, transfers to state-of-the-art architectures such as Flux without additional training, and shows synergistic effects with denoiser-based concept erasing methods.

Result: Improved linguistic accuracy, temporal coherence, and cross-site generalization on J-MID and MIMIC-CXR datasets.

Conclusion: Establishing FedTAR as a robust and privacy-preserving paradigm for federated longitudinal modeling.

Abstract: Longitudinal medical report generation is clinically important yet remains challenging due to strict privacy constraints and the evolving nature of disease progression. Although federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without data sharing, existing FL methods largely overlook longitudinal dynamics by assuming stationary client distributions, making them unable to model temporal shifts across visits or patient-specific heterogeneity-ultimately leading to unstable optimization and suboptimal report generation.
  We introduce Federated Temporal Adaptation (FTA), a federated setting that explicitly accounts for the temporal evolution of client data. Building upon this setting, we propose FedTAR, a framework that integrates demographic-driven personalization with time-aware global aggregation. FedTAR generates lightweight LoRA adapters from demographic embeddings and performs temporal residual aggregation, where updates from different visits are weighted by a meta-learned temporal policy optimized via first-order MAML.
  Experiments on J-MID (1M exams) and MIMIC-CXR demonstrate consistent improvements in linguistic accuracy, temporal coherence, and cross-site generalization, establishing FedTAR as a robust and privacy-preserving paradigm for federated longitudinal modeling.

Conclusion: TeHOR框架在非接触式人-物交互和整体交互理解方面有显著改进

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of 3D human and object from a single image is an active research area, with pivotal applications in robotics and digital content creation. Despite recent advances, existing approaches suffer from two fundamental limitations. First, their reconstructions rely heavily on physical contact information, which inherently cannot capture non-contact human-object interactions, such as gazing at or pointing toward an object. Second, the reconstruction process is primarily driven by local geometric proximity, neglecting the human and object appearances that provide global context crucial for understanding holistic interactions. To address these issues, we introduce TeHOR, a framework built upon two core designs. First, beyond contact information, our framework leverages text descriptions of human-object interactions to enforce semantic alignment between the 3D reconstruction and its textual cues, enabling reasoning over a wider spectrum of interactions, including non-contact cases. Second, we incorporate appearance cues of the 3D human and object into the alignment process to capture holistic contextual information, thereby ensuring visually plausible reconstructions. As a result, our framework produces accurate and semantically coherent reconstructions, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Key part of robotics, augmented reality, and digital inspection is dense 3D reconstruction from depth observations. Traditional volumetric fusion techniques, including truncated signed distance functions (TSDF), enable efficient and deterministic geometry reconstruction; however, they depend on heuristic weighting and fail to transparently convey uncertainty in a systematic way. Recent neural implicit methods, on the other hand, get very high fidelity but usually need a lot of GPU power for optimization and aren't very easy to understand for making decisions later on. This work presents BayesFusion-SDF, a CPU-centric probabilistic signed distance fusion framework that conceptualizes geometry as a sparse Gaussian random field with a defined posterior distribution over voxel distances. First, a rough TSDF reconstruction is used to create an adaptive narrow-band domain. Then, depth observations are combined using a heteroscedastic Bayesian formulation that is solved using sparse linear algebra and preconditioned conjugate gradients. Randomized diagonal estimators are a quick way to get an idea of posterior uncertainty. This makes it possible to extract surfaces and plan the next best view while taking into account uncertainty. Tests on a controlled ablation scene and a CO3D object sequence show that the new method is more accurate geometrically than TSDF baselines and gives useful estimates of uncertainty for active sensing. The proposed formulation provides a clear and easy-to-use alternative to GPU-heavy neural reconstruction methods while still being able to be understood in a probabilistic way and acting in a predictable way.

Abstract: Single LDR to HDR reconstruction remains challenging for over-exposed regions where traditional methods often fail due to complete information loss. We present a training-free approach that enhances existing indirect and direct HDR reconstruction methods through diffusion-based inpainting. Our method combines text-guided diffusion models with SDEdit refinement to generate plausible content in over-exposed areas while maintaining consistency across multi-exposure LDR images. Unlike previous approaches requiring extensive training, our method seamlessly integrates with existing HDR reconstruction techniques through an iterative compensation mechanism that ensures luminance coherence across multiple exposures. We demonstrate significant improvements in both perceptual quality and quantitative metrics on standard HDR datasets and in-the-wild captures. Results show that our method effectively recovers natural details in challenging scenarios while preserving the advantages of existing HDR reconstruction pipelines.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决数据稀缺问题，提高模型性能。

Abstract: Beyond general recognition tasks, specialized domains including privacy-constrained medical applications and fine-grained settings often encounter data scarcity, especially for tail classes. To obtain less biased and more reliable models under such scarcity, practitioners leverage diffusion models to supplement underrepresented regions of real data. Specifically, recent studies fine-tune pretrained diffusion models with LoRA on few-shot real sets to synthesize additional images. While an image-wise LoRA trained on a single image captures fine-grained details yet offers limited diversity, a class-wise LoRA trained over all shots produces diverse images as it encodes class priors yet tends to overlook fine details. To combine both benefits, we separate the adapter into a class-shared LoRA~$A$ for class priors and per-image LoRAs~$\mathcal{B}$ for image-specific characteristics. To expose coherent class semantics in the shared LoRA~$A$, we propose a semantic boosting by preserving class bounding boxes during training. For generation, we compose $A$ with a mixture of $\mathcal{B}$ using coefficients drawn from a Dirichlet distribution. Across diverse datasets, our synthesized images are both diverse and detail-rich while closely aligning with the few-shot real distribution, yielding robust gains in downstream classification accuracy.

Motivation: 解决现有视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型在特征坍缩和低训练效率方面的问题，因为它们将高级感知与稀疏的、体现特定的动作监督纠缠在一起。

Method: 提出Pose-VLA，一个解耦的范式，将VLA训练分为预训练阶段和后训练阶段。预训练阶段用于在统一的以相机为中心的空间中提取通用的3D空间先验，后训练阶段用于在机器人特定的动作空间中进行高效的体现对齐。通过引入离散姿态标记作为通用表示，Pose-VLA无缝集成了来自不同3D数据集的空间定位和来自机器人演示的几何级轨迹。框架遵循两阶段预训练管道，通过姿态建立基本的空间定位，然后通过轨迹监督进行运动对齐。

Result: 在RoboTwin 2.0上达到79.5%的平均成功率，在LIBERO上具有竞争力的性能。现实世界的实验进一步展示了使用每个任务仅100个演示在多样化物体上的鲁棒泛化，验证了我们的预训练范式的效率。

Conclusion: Pose-VLA在视觉-语言-动作任务中表现出色，提高了训练效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often suffer from feature collapse and low training efficiency because they entangle high-level perception with sparse, embodiment-specific action supervision. Since these models typically rely on VLM backbones optimized for Visual Question Answering (VQA), they excel at semantic identification but often overlook subtle 3D state variations that dictate distinct action patterns.
  To resolve these misalignments, we propose Pose-VLA, a decoupled paradigm that separates VLA training into a pre-training phase for extracting universal 3D spatial priors in a unified camera-centric space, and a post-training phase for efficient embodiment alignment within robot-specific action space. By introducing discrete pose tokens as a universal representation, Pose-VLA seamlessly integrates spatial grounding from diverse 3D datasets with geometry-level trajectories from robotic demonstrations. Our framework follows a two-stage pre-training pipeline, establishing fundamental spatial grounding via poses followed by motion alignment through trajectory supervision.
  Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Pose-VLA achieves state-of-the-art results on RoboTwin 2.0 with a 79.5% average success rate and competitive performance on LIBERO at 96.0%. Real-world experiments further showcase robust generalization across diverse objects using only 100 demonstrations per task, validating the efficiency of our pre-training paradigm.

Abstract: Deepfake detection models often generate natural-language explanations, yet their reasoning is frequently ungrounded in visual evidence, limiting reliability. Existing evaluations measure classification accuracy but overlook reasoning fidelity. We propose DeepfakeJudge, a framework for scalable reasoning supervision and evaluation, that integrates an out-of-distribution benchmark containing recent generative and editing forgeries, a human-annotated subset with visual reasoning labels, and a suite of evaluation models, that specialize in evaluating reasoning rationales without the need for explicit ground truth reasoning rationales. The Judge is optimized through a bootstrapped generator-evaluator process that scales human feedback into structured reasoning supervision and supports both pointwise and pairwise evaluation. On the proposed meta-evaluation benchmark, our reasoning-bootstrapped model achieves an accuracy of 96.2\%, outperforming \texttt{30x} larger baselines. The reasoning judge attains very high correlation with human ratings and 98.9\% percent pairwise agreement on the human-annotated meta-evaluation subset. These results establish reasoning fidelity as a quantifiable dimension of deepfake detection and demonstrate scalable supervision for interpretable deepfake reasoning. Our user study shows that participants preferred the reasonings generated by our framework 70\% of the time, in terms of faithfulness, groundedness, and usefulness, compared to those produced by other models and datasets.

Method: 提出了一种将6D姿态估计作为三维空间中的条件流匹配问题的创新方法，引入了Flose，一种通过去噪过程根据局部特征推断物体姿态的生成方法。Flose结合了基于外观的语义特征以减少对象对称性引起的歧义，并采用基于RANSAC的配准来处理异常值。

Result: 在BOP基准的五个数据集上验证了Flose，平均召回率提高了+4.5。

Conclusion: Flose在6D姿态估计方面优于现有方法，为解决对象对称性和局部特征不足的问题提供了一种有效的方法。

Abstract: Existing methods for instance-level 6D pose estimation typically rely on neural networks that either directly regress the pose in $\mathrm{SE}(3)$ or estimate it indirectly via local feature matching. The former struggle with object symmetries, while the latter fail in the absence of distinctive local features. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel formulation of 6D pose estimation as a conditional flow matching problem in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We introduce Flose, a generative method that infers object poses via a denoising process conditioned on local features. While prior approaches based on conditional flow matching perform denoising solely based on geometric guidance, Flose integrates appearance-based semantic features to mitigate ambiguities caused by object symmetries. We further incorporate RANSAC-based registration to handle outliers. We validate Flose on five datasets from the established BOP benchmark. Flose outperforms prior methods with an average improvement of +4.5 Average Recall. Project Website : https://tev-fbk.github.io/Flose/

Conclusion: PMM-Synth是一种有效的MRI合成框架，可以提高诊断的完整性，并具有在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Synthesizing missing modalities in multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is vital for ensuring diagnostic completeness, particularly when full acquisitions are infeasible due to time constraints, motion artifacts, and patient tolerance. Recent unified synthesis models have enabled flexible synthesis tasks by accommodating various input-output configurations. However, their training and evaluation are typically restricted to a single dataset, limiting their generalizability across diverse clinical datasets and impeding practical deployment. To address this limitation, we propose PMM-Synth, a personalized MRI synthesis framework that not only supports various synthesis tasks but also generalizes effectively across heterogeneous datasets. PMM-Synth is jointly trained on multiple multi-modal MRI datasets that differ in modality coverage, disease types, and intensity distributions. It achieves cross-dataset generalization through three core innovations: a Personalized Feature Modulation module that dynamically adapts feature representations based on dataset identifier to mitigate the impact of distributional shifts; a Modality-Consistent Batch Scheduler that facilitates stable and efficient batch training under inconsistent modality conditions; and a selective supervision loss to ensure effective learning when ground truth modalities are partially missing. Evaluated on four clinical multi-modal MRI datasets, PMM-Synth consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both one-to-one and many-to-one synthesis tasks, achieving superior PSNR and SSIM scores. Qualitative results further demonstrate improved preservation of anatomical structures and pathological details. Additionally, downstream tumor segmentation and radiological reporting studies suggest that PMM-Synth holds potential for supporting reliable diagnosis under real-world modality-missing scenarios.

Conclusion: VGGT-MPR在多模态地点识别方面取得了显著的进展，为自动驾驶的全局定位和闭环检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In autonomous driving, robust place recognition is critical for global localization and loop closure detection. While inter-modality fusion of camera and LiDAR data in multimodal place recognition (MPR) has shown promise in overcoming the limitations of unimodal counterparts, existing MPR methods basically attend to hand-crafted fusion strategies and heavily parameterized backbones that require costly retraining. To address this, we propose VGGT-MPR, a multimodal place recognition framework that adopts the Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) as a unified geometric engine for both global retrieval and re-ranking. In the global retrieval stage, VGGT extracts geometrically-rich visual embeddings through prior depth-aware and point map supervision, and densifies sparse LiDAR point clouds with predicted depth maps to improve structural representation. This enhances the discriminative ability of fused multimodal features and produces global descriptors for fast retrieval. Beyond global retrieval, we design a training-free re-ranking mechanism that exploits VGGT's cross-view keypoint-tracking capability. By combining mask-guided keypoint extraction with confidence-aware correspondence scoring, our proposed re-ranking mechanism effectively refines retrieval results without additional parameter optimization. Extensive experiments on large-scale autonomous driving benchmarks and our self-collected data demonstrate that VGGT-MPR achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong robustness to severe environmental changes, viewpoint shifts, and occlusions. Our code and data will be made publicly available.

Result: InfScene-SR reconstructs fine details with high perceptual quality and eliminates boundary artifacts. Demonstrated on remote sensing datasets, benefiting tasks like semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: InfScene-SR is a superior framework for spatially continuous super-resolution for large, arbitrary scenes.

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to recover high-resolution (HR) details from low-resolution (LR) inputs, a task where Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have recently shown superior performance compared to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based approaches. However, standard diffusion-based SR models, such as SR3, are typically trained on fixed-size patches and struggle to scale to arbitrary-sized images due to memory constraints. Applying these models via independent patch processing leads to visible seams and inconsistent textures across boundaries. In this paper, we propose InfScene-SR, a framework enabling spatially continuous super-resolution for large, arbitrary scenes. We adapt the iterative refinement process of diffusion models with a novel guided and variance-corrected fusion mechanism, allowing for the seamless generation of large-scale high-resolution imagery without retraining. We validate our approach on remote sensing datasets, demonstrating that InfScene-SR not only reconstructs fine details with high perceptual quality but also eliminates boundary artifacts, benefiting downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: RAP为3DGS中的原始元素重要性评估提供了一种快速、高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a leading technology for high-quality 3D scene reconstruction. However, the iterative refinement and densification process leads to the generation of a large number of primitives, each contributing to the reconstruction to a substantially different extent. Estimating primitive importance is thus crucial, both for removing redundancy during reconstruction and for enabling efficient compression and transmission. Existing methods typically rely on rendering-based analyses, where each primitive is evaluated through its contribution across multiple camera viewpoints. However, such methods are sensitive to the number and selection of views, rely on specialized differentiable rasterizers, and have long calculation times that grow linearly with view count, making them difficult to integrate as plug-and-play modules and limiting scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose RAP, a fast feedforward rendering-free attribute-guided method for efficient importance score prediction in 3DGS. RAP infers primitive significance directly from intrinsic Gaussian attributes and local neighborhood statistics, avoiding rendering-based or visibility-dependent computations. A compact MLP predicts per-primitive importance scores using rendering loss, pruning-aware loss, and significance distribution regularization. After training on a small set of scenes, RAP generalizes effectively to unseen data and can be seamlessly integrated into reconstruction, compression, and transmission pipelines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal learning progress heavily relies on large-scale image-text datasets, making training costly and inefficient.

Conclusion: A learning-free dataset distillation framework is proposed to enhance generalization across architectures without the need for large-scale training and optimization.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal learning have achieved remarkable success across diverse vision-language tasks. However, such progress heavily relies on large-scale image-text datasets, making training costly and inefficient. Prior efforts in dataset filtering and pruning attempt to mitigate this issue, but still require relatively large subsets to maintain performance and fail under very small subsets. Dataset distillation offers a promising alternative, yet existing multimodal dataset distillation methods require full-dataset training and joint optimization of image pixels and text features, making them architecture-dependent and limiting cross-architecture generalization. To overcome this, we propose a learning-free dataset distillation framework that eliminates the need for large-scale training and optimization while enhancing generalization across architectures. Our method uses CLIP to extract aligned image-text embeddings, obtains prototypes, and employs an unCLIP decoder to synthesize images, enabling efficient and scalable multimodal dataset distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms optimization-based dataset distillation and subset selection methods, achieving state-of-the-art cross-architecture generalization.

Abstract: Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in image understanding and natural language generation. However, current approaches focus predominantly on global image understanding, struggling to simulate human visual attention trajectories and explain associations between descriptions and specific regions. We propose TraceVision, a unified vision-language model integrating trajectory-aware spatial understanding in an end-to-end framework. TraceVision employs a Trajectory-aware Visual Perception (TVP) module for bidirectional fusion of visual features and trajectory information. We design geometric simplification to extract semantic keypoints from raw trajectories and propose a three-stage training pipeline where trajectories guide description generation and region localization. We extend TraceVision to trajectory-guided segmentation and video scene understanding, enabling cross-frame tracking and temporal attention analysis. We construct the Reasoning-based Interactive Localized Narratives (RILN) dataset to enhance logical reasoning and interpretability. Extensive experiments on trajectory-guided captioning, text-guided trajectory prediction, understanding, and segmentation demonstrate that TraceVision achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing a foundation for intuitive spatial interaction and interpretable visual understanding.

Motivation: 自主视觉应用在生产、物流或制造环境中需要超越小范围固定类别的感知能力。

Result: 在代表性3D工业车间场景中，对开放词汇查询进行了评估，结果表明成功分割了工业对象。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的方法能够克服现有方法在工业对象感知上的局限性，并成功应用于开放词汇查询。

Abstract: Autonomous vision applications in production, intralogistics, or manufacturing environments require perception capabilities beyond a small, fixed set of classes. Recent open-vocabulary methods, leveraging 2D Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLFMs), target this task but often rely on class-agnostic segmentation models pre-trained on non-industrial datasets (e.g., household scenes). In this work, we first demonstrate that such models fail to generalize, performing poorly on common industrial objects. Therefore, we propose a training-free, open-vocabulary 3D perception pipeline that overcomes this limitation. Instead of using a pre-trained model to generate instance proposals, our method simply generates masks by merging pre-computed superpoints based on their semantic features. Following, we evaluate the domain-adapted VLFM "IndustrialCLIP" on a representative 3D industrial workshop scene for open-vocabulary querying. Our qualitative results demonstrate successful segmentation of industrial objects.

Method: 提出TextShield-R1，一种基于强化学习的MLLM解决方案，用于篡改文本检测和推理。

Result: TextShield-R1在可解释篡改文本检测方面取得了显著进展，解决了现有基准的七个主要局限性，并支持跨风格、跨方法和跨语言的严格评估。

Conclusion: TextShield-R1为篡改文本检测和推理提供了可靠的方法，提高了检测的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of tampered images poses serious security threats, highlighting the urgent need for reliable detection methods. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong potential in analyzing tampered images and generating interpretations. However, they still struggle with identifying micro-level artifacts, exhibit low accuracy in localizing tampered text regions, and heavily rely on expensive annotations for forgery interpretation. To this end, we introduce TextShield-R1, the first reinforcement learning based MLLM solution for tampered text detection and reasoning. Specifically, our approach introduces Forensic Continual Pre-training, an easy-to-hard curriculum that well prepares the MLLM for tampered text detection by harnessing the large-scale cheap data from natural image forensic and OCR tasks. During fine-tuning, we perform Group Relative Policy Optimization with novel reward functions to reduce annotation dependency and improve reasoning capabilities. At inference time, we enhance localization accuracy via OCR Rectification, a method that leverages the MLLM's strong text recognition abilities to refine its predictions. Furthermore, to support rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Text Forensics Reasoning (TFR) benchmark, comprising over 45k real and tampered images across 16 languages, 10 tampering techniques, and diverse domains. Rich reasoning-style annotations are included, allowing for comprehensive assessment. Our TFR benchmark simultaneously addresses seven major limitations of existing benchmarks and enables robust evaluation under cross-style, cross-method, and cross-language conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TextShield-R1 significantly advances the state of the art in interpretable tampered text detection.

Abstract: Skin lesion classification datasets often suffer from severe class imbalance, with malignant cases significantly underrepresented, leading to biased decision boundaries during deep learning training. We address this challenge using class-conditioned diffusion models to generate synthetic dermatological images, followed by self-supervised MAE pretraining to enable huge ViT models to learn robust, domain-relevant features. To support deployment in practical clinical settings, where lightweight models are required, we apply knowledge distillation to transfer these representations to a smaller ViT student suitable for mobile devices. Our results show that MAE pretraining on synthetic data, combined with distillation, improves classification performance while enabling efficient on-device inference for practical clinical use.

Abstract: Deep learning models for dermatological image analysis remain sensitive to acquisition variability and domain-specific visual characteristics, leading to performance degradation when deployed in clinical settings. We investigate how visual artifacts and domain shifts affect deep learning-based skin lesion classification. We propose an adaptation strategy, grounded in the idea of visual meta-domains, that transfers visual representations from larger dermoscopic datasets into clinical image domains, thereby improving generalization robustness. Experiments across multiple dermatology datasets show consistent gains in classification performance and reduced gaps between dermoscopic and clinical images. These results emphasize the importance of domain-aware training for deployable systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球观测（EO）领域的多样化传感器和模式使得单一的通用模型不切实际，需要多个专业的地球观测基础模型（EOFMs）共存，并且高效的知识迁移对于跨模式至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种双教师对比蒸馏框架，用于多光谱图像，该框架将学生的预训练目标与现代光学视觉基础模型（VFMs）的对比自蒸馏范式相结合。方法结合了多光谱教师和光学VFM教师，以实现跨模态表示学习。

Result: 在多个光学和多光谱基准测试中，该模型在不影响光学仅输入性能的情况下适应了多光谱数据，在两种设置中都取得了最先进的结果，语义分割平均提高了3.64个百分点，变化检测提高了1.2，分类任务提高了1.31。

Conclusion: 对比蒸馏为跨异构地球观测数据源的缩放表示学习提供了一种原则性和高效的方法。

Abstract: Foundation models are transforming Earth Observation (EO), yet the diversity of EO sensors and modalities makes a single universal model unrealistic. Multiple specialized EO foundation models (EOFMs) will likely coexist, making efficient knowledge transfer across modalities essential. Most existing EO pretraining relies on masked image modeling, which emphasizes local reconstruction but provides limited control over global semantic structure. To address this, we propose a dual-teacher contrastive distillation framework for multispectral imagery that aligns the student's pretraining objective with the contrastive self-distillation paradigm of modern optical vision foundation models (VFMs). Our approach combines a multispectral teacher with an optical VFM teacher, enabling coherent cross-modal representation learning. Experiments across diverse optical and multispectral benchmarks show that our model adapts to multispectral data without compromising performance on optical-only inputs, achieving state-of-the-art results in both settings, with an average improvement of 3.64 percentage points in semantic segmentation, 1.2 in change detection, and 1.31 in classification tasks. This demonstrates that contrastive distillation provides a principled and efficient approach to scalable representation learning across heterogeneous EO data sources. Code: Coming soon.

Motivation: 减少视觉标记冗余以提高视觉语言模型（VLM）的推理效率。

Method: 提出了一种近似误差引导的标记压缩框架（ApET），通过线性近似重建原始视觉标记，并利用近似误差识别并丢弃信息量最少的标记。

Result: 在多个VLM和基准测试中，ApET在图像理解任务上保留了95.2%的原有性能，在视频理解任务上甚至达到了100.4%，同时将标记预算压缩了88.9%和87.5%。

Conclusion: ApET通过无注意力设计，与FlashAttention无缝集成，进一步加速推理，使VLM部署更加实用。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal understanding capabilities, yet the redundant visual tokens incur prohibitive computational overhead and degrade inference efficiency. Prior studies typically relies on [CLS] attention or text-vision cross-attention to identify and discard redundant visual tokens. Despite promising results, such solutions are prone to introduce positional bias and, more critically, are incompatible with efficient attention kernels such as FlashAttention, limiting their practical deployment for VLM acceleration. In this paper, we step away from attention dependencies and revisit visual token compression from an information-theoretic perspective, aiming to maximally preserve visual information without any attention involvement. We present ApET, an Approximation-Error guided Token compression framework. ApET first reconstructs the original visual tokens with a small set of basis tokens via linear approximation, then leverages the approximation error to identify and drop the least informative tokens. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that ApET retains 95.2% of the original performance on image-understanding tasks and even attains 100.4% on video-understanding tasks, while compressing the token budgets by 88.9% and 87.5%, respectively. Thanks to its attention-free design, ApET seamlessly integrates with FlashAttention, enabling further inference acceleration and making VLM deployment more practical.

Motivation: C-GCD需要从未标记数据中识别新类别，同时保留对已知类别的知识。现有方法通常动态更新分类器权重，导致遗忘和不一致的特征对齐。

Method: GOAL是一个统一的框架，它引入了一个固定的等角紧框架(ETF)分类器，在整个学习过程中强制执行一致的几何结构。GOAL对标记样本进行监督对齐，对新颖样本进行置信度引导对齐，从而稳定地整合新类别，而不会破坏旧类别。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，GOAL优于先前的Happy方法，减少了16.1%的遗忘，并提高了3.2%的新类别发现，为长期持续发现提供了一个强大的解决方案。

Conclusion: GOAL是一个有效的C-GCD方法，能够稳定地整合新类别，同时减少遗忘，提高新类别发现。

Abstract: Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD) requires identifying novel classes from unlabeled data while retaining knowledge of known classes over time. Existing methods typically update classifier weights dynamically, resulting in forgetting and inconsistent feature alignment. We propose GOAL, a unified framework that introduces a fixed Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) classifier to impose a consistent geometric structure throughout learning. GOAL conducts supervised alignment for labeled samples and confidence-guided alignment for novel samples, enabling stable integration of new classes without disrupting old ones. Experiments on four benchmarks show that GOAL outperforms the prior method Happy, reducing forgetting by 16.1% and boosting novel class discovery by 3.2%, establishing a strong solution for long-horizon continual discovery.

Method: 构建了 BigMaQ 3D 动作和动画数据集，包含超过 750 场互动恒河猴的详细 3D 姿态描述，并通过调整高质量的猴子模板网格来构建特定主题的纹理化身。

Result: BigMaQ 提供了比之前基于表面的动物跟踪方法更精确的姿势描述，并通过结合特征和姿势描述，显著提高了平均精度 (mAP)。

Conclusion: BigMaQ 建立了第一个将动态 3D 姿态-形状表示集成到动物动作识别学习任务中的数据集，并提供了丰富的资源以促进非人灵长类视觉外观、姿态和社会互动的研究。

Abstract: The recognition of dynamic and social behavior in animals is fundamental for advancing ethology, ecology, medicine and neuroscience. Recent progress in deep learning has enabled automated behavior recognition from video, yet an accurate reconstruction of the three-dimensional (3D) pose and shape has not been integrated into this process. Especially for non-human primates, mesh-based tracking efforts lag behind those for other species, leaving pose descriptions restricted to sparse keypoints that are unable to fully capture the richness of action dynamics. To address this gap, we introduce the $\textbf{Big Ma}$ca$\textbf{Q}$ue 3D Motion and Animation Dataset ($\texttt{BigMaQ}$), a large-scale dataset comprising more than 750 scenes of interacting rhesus macaques with detailed 3D pose descriptions. Extending previous surface-based animal tracking methods, we construct subject-specific textured avatars by adapting a high-quality macaque template mesh to individual monkeys. This allows us to provide pose descriptions that are more accurate than previous state-of-the-art surface-based animal tracking methods. From the original dataset, we derive BigMaQ500, an action recognition benchmark that links surface-based pose vectors to single frames across multiple individual monkeys. By pairing features extracted from established image and video encoders with and without our pose descriptors, we demonstrate substantial improvements in mean average precision (mAP) when pose information is included. With these contributions, $\texttt{BigMaQ}$ establishes the first dataset that both integrates dynamic 3D pose-shape representations into the learning task of animal action recognition and provides a rich resource to advance the study of visual appearance, posture, and social interaction in non-human primates. The code and data are publicly available at https://martinivis.github.io/BigMaQ/ .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most recent approaches in unsupervised change detection (UCD) in remote sensing rely on predefined assumptions about change types, limiting their real-world usage.

Method: Propose MaSoN, an end-to-end UCD framework that synthesises diverse changes directly in the latent feature space during training.

Result: MaSoN generalises strongly across diverse change types and achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks, improving the average F1 score by 14.1 percentage points.

Conclusion: MaSoN is an effective UCD framework that addresses the limitations of existing methods by synthesising diverse changes in the latent feature space.

Abstract: Unsupervised change detection (UCD) in remote sensing aims to localise semantic changes between two images of the same region without relying on labelled data during training. Most recent approaches rely either on frozen foundation models in a training-free manner or on training with synthetic changes generated in pixel space. Both strategies inherently rely on predefined assumptions about change types, typically introduced through handcrafted rules, external datasets, or auxiliary generative models. Due to these assumptions, such methods fail to generalise beyond a few change types, limiting their real-world usage, especially in rare or complex scenarios. To address this, we propose MaSoN (Make Some Noise), an end-to-end UCD framework that synthesises diverse changes directly in the latent feature space during training. It generates changes that are dynamically estimated using feature statistics of target data, enabling diverse yet data-driven variation aligned with the target domain. It also easily extends to new modalities, such as SAR. MaSoN generalises strongly across diverse change types and achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks, improving the average F1 score by 14.1 percentage points.

Abstract: The lactation performance of Saanen dairy goats, renowned for their high milk yield, is intrinsically linked to their body size, making accurate 3D body measurement essential for assessing milk production potential, yet existing reconstruction methods lack goat-specific authentic 3D data. To address this limitation, we establish the FemaleSaanenGoat dataset containing synchronized eight-view RGBD videos of 55 female Saanen goats (6-18 months). Using multi-view DynamicFusion, we fuse noisy, non-rigid point cloud sequences into high-fidelity 3D scans, overcoming challenges from irregular surfaces and rapid movement. Based on these scans, we develop SaanenGoat, a parametric 3D shape model specifically designed for female Saanen goats. This model features a refined template with 41 skeletal joints and enhanced udder representation, registered with our scan data. A comprehensive shape space constructed from 48 goats enables precise representation of diverse individual variations. With the help of SaanenGoat model, we get high-precision 3D reconstruction from single-view RGBD input, and achieve automated measurement of six critical body dimensions: body length, height, chest width, chest girth, hip width, and hip height. Experimental results demonstrate the superior accuracy of our method in both 3D reconstruction and body measurement, presenting a novel paradigm for large-scale 3D vision applications in precision livestock farming.

Conclusion: 该方法有效地提高了电影肖像视频生成的质量，为未来研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: While diffusion models have shown great potential in portrait generation, generating expressive, coherent, and controllable cinematic portrait videos remains a significant challenge. Existing intermediate signals for portrait generation, such as 2D landmarks and parametric models, have limited disentanglement capabilities and cannot express personalized details due to their sparse or low-rank representation. Therefore, existing methods based on these models struggle to accurately preserve subject identity and expressions, hindering the generation of highly expressive portrait videos. To overcome these limitations, we propose a high-fidelity personalized head representation that more effectively disentangles expression and identity. This representation captures both static, subject-specific global geometry and dynamic, expression-related details. Furthermore, we introduce an expression transfer module to achieve personalized transfer of head pose and expression details between different identities. We use this sophisticated and highly expressive head model as a conditional signal to train a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based generator to synthesize richly detailed portrait videos. Extensive experiments on self- and cross-reenactment tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous models in terms of identity preservation, expression accuracy, and temporal stability, particularly in capturing fine-grained details of complex motion.

Result: 在糖尿病视网膜病变的关键指标上，该方法将生物标志物分类的准确性提高了6%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法在医学图像对比学习方面取得了一定的成效，提高了生物标志物分类的准确性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel selection strategy for contrastive learning for medical images. On natural images, contrastive learning uses augmentations to select positive and negative pairs for the contrastive loss. However, in the medical domain, arbitrary augmentations have the potential to distort small localized regions that contain the biomarkers we are interested in detecting. A more intuitive approach is to select samples with similar disease severity characteristics, since these samples are more likely to have similar structures related to the progression of a disease. To enable this, we introduce a method that generates disease severity labels for unlabeled OCT scans on the basis of gradient responses from an anomaly detection algorithm. These labels are used to train a supervised contrastive learning setup to improve biomarker classification accuracy by as much as 6% above self-supervised baselines for key indicators of Diabetic Retinopathy.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify both known and unknown categories, with only partial labels given for the known categories, posing a challenging open-set recognition problem. State-of-the-art approaches for GCD task are usually built on multi-modality representation learning, which is heavily dependent upon inter-modality alignment. However, few of them cast a proper intra-modality alignment to generate a desired underlying structure of representation distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective multi-modal representation learning framework for GCD via Semi-Supervised Rate Reduction, called SSR$^2$-GCD, to learn cross-modality representations with desired structural properties based on emphasizing to properly align intra-modality relationships. Moreover, to boost knowledge transfer, we integrate prompt candidates by leveraging the inter-modal alignment offered by Vision Language Models. We conduct extensive experiments on generic and fine-grained benchmark datasets demonstrating superior performance of our approach.

Result: 在渲染性能和参数效率方面优于现有的 NeRF 方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地提高了 3DGS 的渲染质量和效率。

Abstract: Due to the real-time rendering performance, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as the leading method for radiance field reconstruction. However, its reliance on spherical harmonics for color encoding inherently limits its ability to separate diffuse and specular components, making it challenging to accurately represent complex reflections. To address this, we propose a novel enhanced Gaussian kernel that explicitly models specular effects through view-dependent opacity. Meanwhile, we introduce an error-driven compensation strategy to improve rendering quality in existing 3DGS scenes. Our method begins with 2D Gaussian initialization and then adaptively inserts and optimizes enhanced Gaussian kernels, ultimately producing an augmented radiance field. Experiments demonstrate that our method not only surpasses state-of-the-art NeRF methods in rendering performance but also achieves greater parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: 挑战了视觉研究中一个日益增长的假设，即生成现实主义的进步意味着数据现实主义的进步。强调了重新思考现代T2I模型作为可靠训练数据生成器的能力的紧迫性。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models produce visually stunning images and demonstrate excellent prompt following. But do they perform well as synthetic vision data generators? In this work, we revisit the promise of synthetic data as a scalable substitute for real training sets and uncover a surprising performance regression. We generate large-scale synthetic datasets using state-of-the-art T2I models released between 2022 and 2025, train standard classifiers solely on this synthetic data, and evaluate them on real test data. Despite observable advances in visual fidelity and prompt adherence, classification accuracy on real test data consistently declines with newer T2I models as training data generators. Our analysis reveals a hidden trend: These models collapse to a narrow, aesthetic-centric distribution that undermines diversity and label-image alignment. Overall, our findings challenge a growing assumption in vision research, namely that progress in generative realism implies progress in data realism. We thus highlight an urgent need to rethink the capabilities of modern T2I models as reliable training data generators.

Motivation: 解决现有图像生成模型在空间推理方面的困难，缺乏准确捕捉细粒度空间关系的能力。

Method: 提出RL-RIG，一个基于反射的图像生成强化学习框架，包括Diffuser、Checker、Actor和Inverse Diffuser四个主要组件，采用Generate-Reflect-Edit范式。

Result: 实验结果表明，RL-RIG在图像生成中的可控和精确空间推理方面优于现有开源模型，最高可达11%。

Conclusion: RL-RIG在空间推理方面具有显著优势，为图像生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image generation have achieved impressive results in producing high-quality images. However, existing image generation models still generally struggle with a spatial reasoning dilemma, lacking the ability to accurately capture fine-grained spatial relationships from the prompt and correctly generate scenes with structural integrity. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose RL-RIG, a Reinforcement Learning framework for Reflection-based Image Generation. Our architecture comprises four primary components: Diffuser, Checker, Actor, and Inverse Diffuser, following a Generate-Reflect-Edit paradigm to spark the Chain of Thought reasoning ability in image generation for addressing the dilemma. To equip the model with better intuition over generation trajectories, we further develop Reflection-GRPO to train the VLM Actor for edit prompts and the Image Editor for better image quality under a given prompt, respectively. Unlike traditional approaches that solely produce visually stunning yet structurally unreasonable content, our evaluation metrics prioritize spatial accuracy, utilizing Scene Graph IoU and employing a VLM-as-a-Judge strategy to assess the spatial consistency of generated images on LAION-SG dataset. Experimental results show that RL-RIG outperforms existing state-of-the-art open-source models by up to 11% in terms of controllable and precise spatial reasoning in image generation.

Motivation: 汽车感知系统需要满足高要求，雷达感知性能优于摄像头和激光雷达，但雷达数据集有限，现有方法存在信息损失问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于快速傅里叶变换的4D RADE张量3D投影方法，并引入了RADE-Net模型，该模型使用空间和通道注意力来利用雷达张量的低级和高级线索，并直接预测范围-方位域中的对象中心点以及从丰富的特征图中回归旋转的3D边界框。

Conclusion: 该方法在提高雷达感知性能方面取得了显著成果，为恶劣天气条件下的自动驾驶提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Automotive perception systems are obligated to meet high requirements. While optical sensors such as Camera and Lidar struggle in adverse weather conditions, Radar provides a more robust perception performance, effectively penetrating fog, rain, and snow. Since full Radar tensors have large data sizes and very few datasets provide them, most Radar-based approaches work with sparse point clouds or 2D projections, which can result in information loss. Additionally, deep learning methods show potential to extract richer and more dense features from low level Radar data and therefore significantly increase the perception performance. Therefore, we propose a 3D projection method for fast-Fourier-transformed 4D Range-Azimuth-Doppler-Elevation (RADE) tensors. Our method preserves rich Doppler and Elevation features while reducing the required data size for a single frame by 91.9% compared to a full tensor, thus achieving higher training and inference speed as well as lower model complexity. We introduce RADE-Net, a lightweight model tailored to 3D projections of the RADE tensor. The backbone enables exploitation of low-level and high-level cues of Radar tensors with spatial and channel-attention. The decoupled detection heads predict object center-points directly in the Range-Azimuth domain and regress rotated 3D bounding boxes from rich feature maps in the cartesian scene. We evaluate the model on scenes with multiple different road users and under various weather conditions on the large-scale K-Radar dataset and achieve a 16.7% improvement compared to their baseline, as well as 6.5% improvement over current Radar-only models. Additionally, we outperform several Lidar approaches in scenarios with adverse weather conditions. The code is available under https://github.com/chr-is-tof/RADE-Net.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对Transformer在医学图像处理中计算量大的问题，提出Token-UNet模型。

Method: 采用TokenLearner和TokenFuser模块将Transformer封装进UNet架构，通过Tokenization技术降低计算量。

Result: Token-UNet模型在计算资源受限的环境下，内存占用、计算时间和参数数量分别降低了33%、10%和35%，同时平均Dice分数提高了0.46%。

Conclusion: Token-UNet模型在计算资源受限的医学图像处理领域具有显著优势，可加速模型开发和多样化研究方法。

Abstract: We present Token-UNet, adopting the TokenLearner and TokenFuser modules to encase Transformers into UNets.
  While Transformers have enabled global interactions among input elements in medical imaging, current computational challenges hinder their deployment on common hardware. Models like (Swin)UNETR adapt the UNet architecture by incorporating (Swin)Transformer encoders, which process tokens that each represent small subvolumes ($8^3$ voxels) of the input.
  The Transformer attention mechanism scales quadratically with the number of tokens, which is tied to the cubic scaling of 3D input resolution.
  This work reconsiders the role of convolution and attention, introducing Token-UNets, a family of 3D segmentation models that can operate in constrained computational environments and time frames.
  To mitigate computational demands, our approach maintains the convolutional encoder of UNet-like models, and applies TokenLearner to 3D feature maps. This module pools a preset number of tokens from local and global structures.
  Our results show this tokenization effectively encodes task-relevant information, yielding naturally interpretable attention maps. The memory footprint, computation times at inference, and parameter counts of our heaviest model are reduced to 33\%, 10\%, and 35\% of the SwinUNETR values, with better average performance (86.75\% $\pm 0.19\%$ Dice score for SwinUNETR vs our 87.21\% $\pm 0.35\%$).
  This work opens the way to more efficient trainings in contexts with limited computational resources, such as 3D medical imaging. Easing model optimization, fine-tuning, and transfer-learning in limited hardware settings can accelerate and diversify the development of approaches, for the benefit of the research community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确分类是生物多样性监测和农业管理的基础，尤其是在高度多样化的Ichneumonoidea超科中。这些寄生蜂在调节昆虫种群方面生态上至关重要，但由于其隐秘的形态和大量未描述的物种，它们仍然是分类上最具挑战性的群体之一。

Method: 为了解决这些关键群体缺乏强大数字资源的问题，我们提供了一个精心制作的图像数据集，用于推进自动化识别系统。数据集包含3,556张高分辨率图像，主要关注新热带地区的Ichneumonidae和Braconidae，同时还包括Andrenidae、Apidae、Bethylidae、Chrysididae、Colletidae、Halictidae、Megachilidae、Pompilidae和Vespidae等补充科，以提高模型的鲁棒性。关键的是，1,739张图像以COCO格式进行了注释，包括整个昆虫身体、翅膀脉纹和刻度尺的多类边界框。

Result: 该资源为开发能够识别这些科类的计算机视觉模型奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了一个有助于提高Ichneumonoidea超科中寄生蜂自动化识别的图像数据集，为生物多样性和农业管理提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Accurate taxonomic identification is the cornerstone of biodiversity monitoring and agricultural management, particularly for the hyper-diverse superfamily Ichneumonoidea. Comprising the families Ichneumonidae and Braconidae, these parasitoid wasps are ecologically critical for regulating insect populations, yet they remain one of the most taxonomically challenging groups due to their cryptic morphology and vast number of undescribed species. To address the scarcity of robust digital resources for these key groups, we present a curated image dataset designed to advance automated identification systems. The dataset contains 3,556 high-resolution images, primarily focused on Neotropical Ichneumonidae and Braconidae, while also including supplementary families such as Andrenidae, Apidae, Bethylidae, Chrysididae, Colletidae, Halictidae, Megachilidae, Pompilidae, and Vespidae to improve model robustness. Crucially, a subset of 1,739 images is annotated in COCO format, featuring multi-class bounding boxes for the full insect body, wing venation, and scale bars. This resource provides a foundation for developing computer vision models capable of identifying these families.

Motivation: Multimodal learning中的CLIP方法在映射不同模态到共享潜在空间时存在模态间隙问题，影响语义对齐。

Method: 提出一个模态无关的框架来关闭模态间隙，确保语义相关的表示更加对齐。

Result: 该方法增强了放射学图像和临床文本之间的对齐，提高了跨模态检索和图像字幕生成。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了医疗领域中也存在模态间隙，并提出了一个有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In multimodal learning, CLIP has emerged as the de-facto approach for mapping different modalities into a shared latent space by bringing semantically similar representations closer while pushing apart dissimilar ones. However, CLIP-based contrastive losses exhibit unintended behaviors that negatively impact true semantic alignment, leading to sparse and fragmented latent spaces. This phenomenon, known as the modality gap, has been partially mitigated for standard text and image pairs but remains unknown and unresolved in more complex multimodal settings, such as the medical domain. In this work, we study this phenomenon in the latter case, revealing that the modality gap is present also in medical alignment, and we propose a modality-agnostic framework that closes this gap, ensuring that semantically related representations are more aligned, regardless of their source modality. Our method enhances alignment between radiology images and clinical text, improving cross-modal retrieval and image captioning.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation (HPE) is characterized by intricate local and global dependencies among joints. Conventional supervised losses are limited in capturing these correlations because they treat each joint independently. Previous studies have attempted to promote structural consistency through manually designed priors or rule-based constraints; however, these approaches typically require manual specification and are often non-differentiable, limiting their use as end-to-end training objectives. We propose SEAL-pose, a data-driven framework in which a learnable loss-net trains a pose-net by evaluating structural plausibility. Rather than relying on hand-crafted priors, our joint-graph-based design enables the loss-net to learn complex structural dependencies directly from data. Extensive experiments on three 3D HPE benchmarks with eight backbones show that SEAL-pose reduces per-joint errors and improves pose plausibility compared with the corresponding backbones across all settings. Beyond improving each backbone, SEAL-pose also outperforms models with explicit structural constraints, despite not enforcing any such constraints. Finally, we analyze the relationship between the loss-net and structural consistency, and evaluate SEAL-pose in cross-dataset and in-the-wild settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对深度学习图像水印在对抗和再生攻击下的脆弱性，以及传统对策的局限性

Method: 提出了一种名为AdvMark的新型两阶段微调框架，通过解耦防御策略来克服这些问题。在第一阶段，通过定制对抗训练范式来应对对抗性脆弱性，主要微调编码器，而仅条件更新解码器。在第二阶段，通过直接图像优化来应对扭曲和再生攻击。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，AdvMark在图像质量和综合鲁棒性方面表现优异，即分别提高了29%、33%和46%的扭曲、再生和对抗攻击的准确性。

Conclusion: AdvMark框架有效提高了深度学习图像水印的鲁棒性，为图像水印技术提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Deep learning-based image watermarking, while robust against conventional distortions, remains vulnerable to advanced adversarial and regeneration attacks. Conventional countermeasures, which jointly optimize the encoder and decoder via a noise layer, face 2 inevitable challenges: (1) decrease of clean accuracy due to decoder adversarial training and (2) limited robustness due to simultaneous training of all three advanced attacks. To overcome these issues, we propose AdvMark, a novel two-stage fine-tuning framework that decouples the defense strategies. In stage 1, we address adversarial vulnerability via a tailored adversarial training paradigm that primarily fine-tunes the encoder while only conditionally updating the decoder. This approach learns to move the image into a non-attackable region, rather than modifying the decision boundary, thus preserving clean accuracy. In stage 2, we tackle distortion and regeneration attacks via direct image optimization. To preserve the adversarial robustness gained in stage 1, we formulate a principled, constrained image loss with theoretical guarantees, which balances the deviation from cover and previous encoded images. We also propose a quality-aware early-stop to further guarantee the lower bound of visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate AdvMark outperforms with the highest image quality and comprehensive robustness, i.e. up to 29\%, 33\% and 46\% accuracy improvement for distortion, regeneration and adversarial attacks, respectively.

Motivation: 为了克服锚点引导生成模型在轨迹规划中的局限性，提高效率和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了一种名为MeanFuser的端到端自动驾驶方法，通过三个关键设计来提升性能：（1）引入高斯混合噪声（GMN）来引导生成采样，实现轨迹空间的连续表示；（2）将“MeanFlow Identity”应用于端到端规划，以GMN和轨迹分布之间的平均速度场来建模，有效消除数值误差并加速推理；（3）设计了一个轻量级的自适应重建模块（ARM），允许模型通过注意力权重隐式地从所有采样提案中选择或重建新的轨迹。

Conclusion: MeanFuser是一种有效的端到端自动驾驶方法，通过创新的设计提高了效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Generative models have shown great potential in trajectory planning. Recent studies demonstrate that anchor-guided generative models are effective in modeling the uncertainty of driving behaviors and improving overall performance. However, these methods rely on discrete anchor vocabularies that must sufficiently cover the trajectory distribution during testing to ensure robustness, inducing an inherent trade-off between vocabulary size and model performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose MeanFuser, an end-to-end autonomous driving method that enhances both efficiency and robustness through three key designs. (1) We introduce Gaussian Mixture Noise (GMN) to guide generative sampling, enabling a continuous representation of the trajectory space and eliminating the dependency on discrete anchor vocabularies. (2) We adapt ``MeanFlow Identity" to end-to-end planning, which models the mean velocity field between GMN and trajectory distribution instead of the instantaneous velocity field used in vanilla flow matching methods, effectively eliminating numerical errors from ODE solvers and significantly accelerating inference. (3) We design a lightweight Adaptive Reconstruction Module (ARM) that enables the model to implicitly select from all sampled proposals or reconstruct a new trajectory when none is satisfactory via attention weights. Experiments on the NAVSIM closed-loop benchmark demonstrate that MeanFuser achieves outstanding performance without the supervision of the PDM Score. and exceptional inference efficiency, offering a robust and efficient solution for end-to-end autonomous driving. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/wjl2244/MeanFuser.

Method: 提出了一种名为HeatPrompt的零样本视觉语言能源建模框架，该框架使用从卫星图像、基本的地理信息系统（GIS）和建筑级特征中提取的语义特征来估计年度热需求。

Result: 与基线模型相比，使用这些标题训练的多层感知器（MLP）回归器将$R^2$提升至93.7%，并将平均绝对误差（MAE）降低了30%。定性分析表明，高影响标记与高需求区域相对应，为数据稀缺地区的热规划提供了轻量级支持。

Conclusion: HeatPrompt框架有效地估计了年度热需求，为数据稀缺地区的热规划提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Accurate heat-demand maps play a crucial role in decarbonizing space heating, yet most municipalities lack detailed building-level data needed to calculate them. We introduce HeatPrompt, a zero-shot vision-language energy modeling framework that estimates annual heat demand using semantic features extracted from satellite images, basic Geographic Information System (GIS), and building-level features. We feed pretrained Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) with a domain-specific prompt to act as an energy planner and extract the visual attributes such as roof age, building density, etc, from the RGB satellite image that correspond to the thermal load. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regressor trained on these captions shows an $R^2$ uplift of 93.7% and shrinks the mean absolute error (MAE) by 30% compared to the baseline model. Qualitative analysis shows that high-impact tokens align with high-demand zones, offering lightweight support for heat planning in data-scarce regions.

Method: 将预训练的语义特征提取器集成到模型中，以增强场景语义作为条件，并采用两种策略：1）扭曲语义特征；2）在每个去噪步骤中进行理解和生成的交替方案。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验结果表明，与最先进的替代方案相比，在FID（4.69%-15.26%）方面有明显的定性和定量改进。

Conclusion: SemanticNVS在NVS任务中取得了显著的性能提升，特别是在长距离相机运动下。

Abstract: We present SemanticNVS, a camera-conditioned multi-view diffusion model for novel view synthesis (NVS), which improves generation quality and consistency by integrating pre-trained semantic feature extractors. Existing NVS methods perform well for views near the input view, however, they tend to generate semantically implausible and distorted images under long-range camera motion, revealing severe degradation. We speculate that this degradation is due to current models failing to fully understand their conditioning or intermediate generated scene content. Here, we propose to integrate pre-trained semantic feature extractors to incorporate stronger scene semantics as conditioning to achieve high-quality generation even at distant viewpoints. We investigate two different strategies, (1) warped semantic features and (2) an alternating scheme of understanding and generation at each denoising step. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the clear qualitative and quantitative (4.69%-15.26% in FID) improvement over state-of-the-art alternatives.

Conclusion: 大型（视觉）语言模型在视觉设计的灵活验证和编辑方面具有巨大潜力，但与符号求解器在视觉感知的微妙方面仍有差距。

Abstract: Data visualization principles, derived from decades of research in design and perception, ensure proper visual communication. While prior work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can generate charts or flag misleading figures, it remains unclear whether they and their vision-language counterparts (VLMs) can reason about and enforce visualization principles directly. Constraint based systems encode these principles as logical rules for precise automated checks, but translating them into formal specifications demands expert knowledge. This motivates leveraging LLMs and VLMs as principle checkers that can reason about visual design directly, bypassing the need for symbolic rule specification. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of both LLMs and VLMs on their ability to reason about visualization principles, using hard verification ground truth derived from Answer Set Programming (ASP). We compiled a set of visualization principles expressed as natural-language statements and generated a controlled dataset of approximately 2,000 Vega-Lite specifications annotated with explicit principle violations, complemented by over 300 real-world Vega-Lite charts. We evaluated both checking and fixing tasks, assessing how well models detect principle violations and correct flawed chart specifications. Our work highlights both the promise of large (vision-)language models as flexible validators and editors of visualization designs and the persistent gap with symbolic solvers on more nuanced aspects of visual perception. They also reveal an interesting asymmetry: frontier models tend to be more effective at correcting violations than at detecting them reliably.

Abstract: The dependence on expert annotation has long constituted the primary rate-limiting step in the application of artificial intelligence to biomedicine. While supervised learning drove the initial wave of clinical algorithms, a paradigm shift towards unsupervised and self-supervised learning (SSL) is currently unlocking the latent potential of biobank-scale datasets. By learning directly from the intrinsic structure of data - whether pixels in a magnetic resonance image (MRI), voxels in a volumetric scan, or tokens in a genomic sequence - these methods facilitate the discovery of novel phenotypes, the linkage of morphology to genetics, and the detection of anomalies without human bias. This article synthesises seminal and recent advances in "learning without labels," highlighting how unsupervised frameworks can derive heritable cardiac traits, predict spatial gene expression in histology, and detect pathologies with performance that rivals or exceeds supervised counterparts.

Conclusion: MU在Vision Transformers上的研究具有重大意义，有助于构建更安全、公平的人工智能系统。

Abstract: Research in machine unlearning (MU) has gained strong momentum: MU is now widely regarded as a critical capability for building safe and fair AI. In parallel, research into transformer architectures for computer vision tasks has been highly successful: Increasingly, Vision Transformers (VTs) emerge as strong alternatives to CNNs. Yet, MU research for vision tasks has largely centered on CNNs, not VTs. While benchmarking MU efforts have addressed LLMs, diffusion models, and CNNs, none exist for VTs. This work is the first to attempt this, benchmarking MU algorithm performance in different VT families (ViT and Swin-T) and at different capacities. The work employs (i) different datasets, selected to assess the impacts of dataset scale and complexity; (ii) different MU algorithms, selected to represent fundamentally different approaches for MU; and (iii) both single-shot and continual unlearning protocols. Additionally, it focuses on benchmarking MU algorithms that leverage training data memorization, since leveraging memorization has been recently discovered to significantly improve the performance of previously SOTA algorithms. En route, the work characterizes how VTs memorize training data relative to CNNs, and assesses the impact of different memorization proxies on performance. The benchmark uses unified evaluation metrics that capture two complementary notions of forget quality along with accuracy on unseen (test) data and on retained data. Overall, this work offers a benchmarking basis, enabling reproducible, fair, and comprehensive comparisons of existing (and future) MU algorithms on VTs. And, for the first time, it sheds light on how well existing algorithms work in VT settings, establishing a promising reference performance baseline.

Abstract: Data visualization rules-derived from decades of research in design and perception-ensure trustworthy chart communication. While prior work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can generate charts or flag misleading figures, it remains unclear whether they can reason about and enforce visualization rules directly. Constraint-based systems such as Draco encode these rules as logical constraints for precise automated checks, but maintaining symbolic encodings requires expert effort, motivating the use of LLMs as flexible rule validators. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of LLMs against visualization rules using hard-verification ground truth derived from Answer Set Programming (ASP). We translated a subset of Draco's constraints into natural-language statements and generated a controlled dataset of 2,000 Vega-Lite specifications annotated with explicit rule violations. LLMs were evaluated on both accuracy in detecting violations and prompt adherence, which measures whether outputs follow the required structured format. Results show that frontier models achieve high adherence (Gemma 3 4B / 27B: 100%, GPT-oss 20B: 98%) and reliably detect common violations (F1 up to 0.82),yet performance drops for subtler perceptual rules (F1 < 0.15 for some categories) and for outputs generated from technical ASP formulations.Translating constraints into natural language improved performance by up to 150% for smaller models. These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs as flexible, language-driven validators while highlighting their current limitations compared to symbolic solvers.

TL;DR: Flow3r通过分解流预测模块，实现了从未标记的单目视频中可扩展的3D/4D重建，在动态场景中取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决当前3D/4D重建系统对密集几何和姿态监督的依赖，这种监督在规模上获取成本高昂，在动态真实场景中尤其稀缺。

Method: 提出Flow3r框架，通过增强视觉几何学习，使用密集2D对应关系（`flow'）作为监督，从而实现从未标记的单目视频中可扩展的训练。关键洞察是将流预测模块分解：使用来自一个图像的几何潜在变量和来自另一个图像的姿态潜在变量来预测两个图像之间的流。这种分解直接指导场景几何和相机运动的学习，并自然扩展到动态场景。

Result: 在控制实验中，显示分解流预测优于替代设计，并且性能与未标记数据一致地扩展。将分解流集成到现有的视觉几何架构中，并使用${\sim}800$K未标记的视频进行训练，Flow3r在静态和动态场景的八个基准测试中实现了最先进的结果，在野外动态视频中的最大增益，因为在这种情况下标记数据最稀缺。

Conclusion: Flow3r框架通过分解流预测模块，实现了对动态场景的高效重建，并在未标记数据上取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Current feed-forward 3D/4D reconstruction systems rely on dense geometry and pose supervision -- expensive to obtain at scale and particularly scarce for dynamic real-world scenes. We present Flow3r, a framework that augments visual geometry learning with dense 2D correspondences (`flow') as supervision, enabling scalable training from unlabeled monocular videos. Our key insight is that the flow prediction module should be factored: predicting flow between two images using geometry latents from one and pose latents from the other. This factorization directly guides the learning of both scene geometry and camera motion, and naturally extends to dynamic scenes. In controlled experiments, we show that factored flow prediction outperforms alternative designs and that performance scales consistently with unlabeled data. Integrating factored flow into existing visual geometry architectures and training with ${\sim}800$K unlabeled videos, Flow3r achieves state-of-the-art results across eight benchmarks spanning static and dynamic scenes, with its largest gains on in-the-wild dynamic videos where labeled data is most scarce.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频推理在视觉质量方面取得了快速发展，但其推理能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出VBVR数据集和VBVR-Bench评估框架，用于大规模视频推理研究。

Result: VBVR数据集规模巨大，VBVR-Bench评估框架可验证，视频推理能力得到初步验证。

Conclusion: VBVR为可推广的视频推理研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Rapid progress in video models has largely focused on visual quality, leaving their reasoning capabilities underexplored. Video reasoning grounds intelligence in spatiotemporally consistent visual environments that go beyond what text can naturally capture, enabling intuitive reasoning over spatiotemporal structure such as continuity, interaction, and causality. However, systematically studying video reasoning and its scaling behavior is hindered by the lack of large-scale training data. To address this gap, we introduce the Very Big Video Reasoning (VBVR) Dataset, an unprecedentedly large-scale resource spanning 200 curated reasoning tasks following a principled taxonomy and over one million video clips, approximately three orders of magnitude larger than existing datasets. We further present VBVR-Bench, a verifiable evaluation framework that moves beyond model-based judging by incorporating rule-based, human-aligned scorers, enabling reproducible and interpretable diagnosis of video reasoning capabilities. Leveraging the VBVR suite, we conduct one of the first large-scale scaling studies of video reasoning and observe early signs of emergent generalization to unseen reasoning tasks. Together, VBVR lays a foundation for the next stage of research in generalizable video reasoning. The data, benchmark toolkit, and models are publicly available at https://video-reason.com/ .

Method: 框架高效地将多个图像观察结果压缩到TTT层的快速权重中，在潜在空间中形成隐式3D表示，可以解码成各种显式格式，如高斯Splats（GS）。支持从流观察中进行渐进式3D重建和细化。

Conclusion: tttLRM模型在3D重建方面表现出色，具有线性计算复杂度和快速收敛速度。

Abstract: We propose tttLRM, a novel large 3D reconstruction model that leverages a Test-Time Training (TTT) layer to enable long-context, autoregressive 3D reconstruction with linear computational complexity, further scaling the model's capability. Our framework efficiently compresses multiple image observations into the fast weights of the TTT layer, forming an implicit 3D representation in the latent space that can be decoded into various explicit formats, such as Gaussian Splats (GS) for downstream applications. The online learning variant of our model supports progressive 3D reconstruction and refinement from streaming observations. We demonstrate that pretraining on novel view synthesis tasks effectively transfers to explicit 3D modeling, resulting in improved reconstruction quality and faster convergence. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in feedforward 3D Gaussian reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art approaches on both objects and scenes.

Method: 提出了Mobile-O模型，该模型的核心模块Mobile Conditioning Projector（MCP）使用深度可分离卷积和层内对齐技术融合视觉-语言特征和扩散生成器，实现高效的多模态条件化。

Result: Mobile-O在GenEval上达到74%的准确率，比Show-O和JanusFlow分别高出5%和11%，同时运行速度分别快6倍和11倍。在视觉理解方面，Mobile-O在七个基准测试中平均超越其他模型15.3%和5.1%。

Conclusion: Mobile-O是一种高效、轻量级的多模态模型，可在边缘设备上实现实时统一的多模态理解和生成。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models can both understand and generate visual content within a single architecture. Existing models, however, remain data-hungry and too heavy for deployment on edge devices. We present Mobile-O, a compact vision-language-diffusion model that brings unified multimodal intelligence to a mobile device. Its core module, the Mobile Conditioning Projector (MCP), fuses vision-language features with a diffusion generator using depthwise-separable convolutions and layerwise alignment. This design enables efficient cross-modal conditioning with minimal computational cost. Trained on only a few million samples and post-trained in a novel quadruplet format (generation prompt, image, question, answer), Mobile-O jointly enhances both visual understanding and generation capabilities. Despite its efficiency, Mobile-O attains competitive or superior performance compared to other unified models, achieving 74% on GenEval and outperforming Show-O and JanusFlow by 5% and 11%, while running 6x and 11x faster, respectively. For visual understanding, Mobile-O surpasses them by 15.3% and 5.1% averaged across seven benchmarks. Running in only ~3s per 512x512 image on an iPhone, Mobile-O establishes the first practical framework for real-time unified multimodal understanding and generation on edge devices. We hope Mobile-O will ease future research in real-time unified multimodal intelligence running entirely on-device with no cloud dependency.

TL;DR: ReportLogic：一种评估LLM生成报告逻辑质量的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估框架忽略报告的逻辑质量，导致报告的可信度降低。

Method: 提出ReportLogic，通过读者中心的审计视角量化报告逻辑质量。

Result: 构建了一个基于人类注释的评分标准数据集，并训练了一个开源的LogicJudge。

Conclusion: ReportLogic有助于构建更可靠的逻辑评估器，提高LLM生成报告的逻辑可靠性。

Abstract: Users increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for Deep Research, using them to synthesize diverse sources into structured reports that support understanding and action. In this context, the practical reliability of such reports hinges on logical quality: whether the report's claims and arguments are explicitly supported and can be trusted as a basis for downstream use, rather than merely appearing fluent or informative. However, current evaluation frameworks largely overlook this requirement. To bridge this gap, we introduce ReportLogic, a benchmark that quantifies report-level logical quality through a reader-centric lens of auditability. Specifically, ReportLogic adopts a hierarchical taxonomy that evaluates whether readers can (1) trace an on-topic report structure with a unified analytical arc (Macro-Logic), (2) understand the progression with necessary context (Expositional-Logic), and (3) verify conclusions via explicit claim--support (Structural-Logic). Based on this taxonomy, we construct a human-annotated rubric-guided dataset and train an open-source LogicJudge for scalable evaluation. We further evaluate judge robustness via adversarial attacks, showing that off-the-shelf LLM judges are frequently influenced by superficial cues (e.g., verbosity), and reasoning modes can mask broken support relations. Overall, our results provide actionable guidance for building more robust logic evaluators and improving the logical reliability of LLM-generated reports.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在复杂任务上性能提升但推理延迟高的难题。

Method: ConfSpec，一个基于置信度的级联验证框架，通过在生成和验证之间存在的不对称性，在保持准确性的同时提高推理速度。

Result: ConfSpec在多个工作负载上实现了显著的加速，且无需额外的模型或资源。

Conclusion: ConfSpec在匹配目标模型精度的同时，实现了高达2.24倍的全局加速，并且无需外部裁判模型，与token级别的投机解码正交，可以进一步加速。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning significantly improves the performance of large language models on complex tasks, but incurs high inference latency due to long generation traces. Step-level speculative reasoning aims to mitigate this cost, yet existing approaches face a long-standing trade-off among accuracy, inference speed, and resource efficiency. We propose ConfSpec, a confidence-gated cascaded verification framework that resolves this trade-off. Our key insight is an asymmetry between generation and verification: while generating a correct reasoning step requires substantial model capacity, step-level verification is a constrained discriminative task for which small draft models are well-calibrated within their competence range, enabling high-confidence draft decisions to be accepted directly while selectively escalating uncertain cases to the large target model. Evaluation across diverse workloads shows that ConfSpec achieves up to 2.24$\times$ end-to-end speedups while matching target-model accuracy. Our method requires no external judge models and is orthogonal to token-level speculative decoding, enabling further multiplicative acceleration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高大型语言模型（LLM）的性能，我们提出了一种基于扩散的框架，利用扩散语言模型（DLM）通过掩码去噪迭代地优化系统提示。

Method: 该方法通过条件化用户查询、模型响应和可选反馈的交互痕迹，实现灵活的跨度级别提示更新，无需访问梯度或修改下游语言模型。

Result: 在多个基准测试（例如 $τ$-bench、SST-2、SST-5）中，DLM优化的提示始终提高了冻结目标LLM（例如 GPT-4o-mini）的性能。同时，我们发现适中的扩散步骤数在精炼质量和稳定性之间提供了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，基于扩散的提示优化是一种通用的、模型无关的且可扩展的方法，通过迭代提示精炼来提高LLM性能。

Abstract: We propose a diffusion-based framework for prompt optimization that leverages Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) to iteratively refine system prompts through masked denoising. By conditioning on interaction traces, including user queries, model responses, and optional feedback, our method enables flexible, span-level prompt updates without requiring gradient access or modifying the downstream language model. Across diverse benchmarks (e.g., $τ$-bench, SST-2, SST-5), DLM-optimized prompts consistently improve the performance of a frozen target LLM (e.g., GPT-4o-mini). We further show that moderate diffusion step counts provide the best balance between refinement quality and stability. These results highlight diffusion-based prompt optimization as a general, model-agnostic, and scalable approach for enhancing LLM performance through iterative prompt refinement.

Abstract: This paper introduces GLiNER-bi-Encoder, a novel architecture for Named Entity Recognition (NER) that harmonizes zero-shot flexibility with industrial-scale efficiency. While the original GLiNER framework offers strong generalization, its joint-encoding approach suffers from quadratic complexity as the number of entity labels increases. Our proposed bi-encoder design decouples the process into a dedicated label encoder and a context encoder, effectively removing the context-window bottleneck. This architecture enables the simultaneous recognition of thousands, and potentially millions, of entity types with minimal overhead. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, achieving 61.5 percent Micro-F1 on the CrossNER benchmark. Crucially, by leveraging pre-computed label embeddings, GLiNER-bi-Encoder achieves up to a 130 times throughput improvement at 1024 labels compared to its uni-encoder predecessors. Furthermore, we introduce GLiNKER, a modular framework that leverages this architecture for high-performance entity linking across massive knowledge bases such as Wikidata.

Conclusion: Luna-2在内容安全和幻觉基准测试中，在准确性方面与最先进的基于LLM的评估器相当，同时将推理成本降低了80倍以上，延迟降低了20倍以上

Abstract: Real-time guardrails require evaluation that is accurate, cheap, and fast - yet today's default, LLM-as-a-judge (LLMAJ), is slow, expensive, and operationally non-deterministic due to multi-token generation. We present Luna-2, a novel architecture that leverages decoder-only small language models (SLMs) into a deterministic evaluation model to reliably compute complex task-specific LLMAJ metrics (e.g. toxicity, hallucination, tool selection quality, etc.) at an accuracy at par or higher than LLMAJ using frontier LLMs while drastically reducing the cost and latency of computation. Each metric is implemented as a lightweight LoRA/PEFT head on top of a shared SLM backbone, enabling hundreds of specialized metrics to run concurrently on a single GPU, deployable locally next to AI systems in a privacy-preserving and latency optimizing manner. Across content safety and hallucination benchmarks, Luna-2 matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art LLM-based evaluators while reducing inference cost by over 80x and latency by over 20x.
  In this paper, we outline the model architecture, training methodology and report real-world empirical results on accuracy, latency, and throughput results. In production, Luna-2 is protecting 100M+ AI sessions and processing over 100B tokens per month for our customers with eval cost savings of over $30M annually.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在私有数据上开发大型语言模型（LLMs）时，差分隐私（DP）合成数据生成起着关键作用，因为数据所有者无法提供对单个示例的逐个访问。

Method: 我们引入了差分隐私强化微调（DP-RFT），这是一种用于合成数据生成的在线强化学习算法。DP-RFT利用来自无直接访问权限的私有语料库的DP保护最近邻投票作为奖励信号，用于LLM生成的按策略合成样本。LLM通过近端策略优化（PPO）迭代学习生成合成数据，以最大化预期的DP投票。

Result: 我们的实验表明，DP-RFT在生成合成数据的保真度和下游效用方面，在私有数据演化和DP微调方法之间缩小了差距，同时遵守私有数据边界。

Conclusion: DP-RFT是一种有效的在线强化学习算法，可以用于生成高质量合成数据，同时确保数据隐私。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) synthetic data generation plays a pivotal role in developing large language models (LLMs) on private data, where data owners cannot provide eyes-on access to individual examples. Generating DP synthetic data typically involves a difficult trade-off. On one hand, DP finetuning methods train an LLM as a synthetic data generator with formal privacy guarantees, yet it still requires the raw content of private examples for model training. However, methods that avoid direct exposure to private data are bounded by an off-the-shelf, un-finetuned model, whose outputs often lack domain fidelity. Can we train an LLM to generate high-quality synthetic text without eyes-on access to individual private examples? In this work, we introduce Differentially Private Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (DP-RFT), an online reinforcement learning algorithm for synthetic data generation with LLMs. DP-RFT leverages DP-protected nearest-neighbor votes from an eyes-off private corpus as a reward signal for on-policy synthetic samples generated by an LLM. The LLM iteratively learns to generate synthetic data to maximize the expected DP votes through Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We evaluate DP-RFT for long-form and domain-specific synthetic data generation, such as news articles, meeting transcripts, and medical article abstracts. Our experiments show that DP-RFT closes the gap between private evolution and DP finetuning methods in terms of the fidelity and downstream utility of the generated synthetic data, while respecting the private data boundary.

TL;DR: PolyFrame系统在多模态惯用语歧义消除任务中表现出色，有效提升了性能，同时证明了无需微调大型编码器即可实现有效歧义消除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型在处理惯用语时存在困难，尤其是在多语言环境中。

Method: 提出PolyFrame系统，该系统用于MWE-2026 AdMIRe2共享任务，包括图像+文本排名（子任务A）和仅文本的标题排名（子任务B）。所有模型变体都保留了冻结的CLIP风格视觉-语言编码器和多语言BGE M3编码器，仅训练轻量级模块：逻辑回归和基于LLM的句子类型预测器、惯用语同义词替换、干扰感知评分和Borda排名融合。

Result: 在英语开发数据集上，从CLIP基线（26.7% Top-1，英语测试集为6.7%）开始，添加了惯用语感知释义和明确的句子类型分类，将性能提升到60.0% Top-1（英语）和60.0% Top-1（0.822 NDCG@5）在零样本迁移到葡萄牙语。在多语言盲测试中，系统在15种语言中实现了平均Top-1/NDCG分数为0.35/0.73（子任务A）和0.32/0.71（子任务B）。消融结果表明，惯用语感知重写是性能提升的主要贡献者，而句子类型预测和多模态融合增强了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 有效的惯用语歧义消除可以在不微调大型多模态编码器的情况下实现。

Abstract: Multimodal models struggle with idiomatic expressions due to their non-compositional meanings, a challenge amplified in multilingual settings. We introduced PolyFrame, our system for the MWE-2026 AdMIRe2 shared task on multimodal idiom disambiguation, featuring a unified pipeline for both image+text ranking (Subtask A) and text-only caption ranking (Subtask B). All model variants retain frozen CLIP-style vision--language encoders and the multilingual BGE M3 encoder, training only lightweight modules: a logistic regression and LLM-based sentence-type predictor, idiom synonym substitution, distractor-aware scoring, and Borda rank fusion. Starting from a CLIP baseline (26.7% Top-1 on English dev, 6.7% on English test), adding idiom-aware paraphrasing and explicit sentence-type classification increased performance to 60.0% Top-1 on English and 60.0% Top-1 (0.822 NDCG@5) in zero-shot transfer to Portuguese. On the multilingual blind test, our systems achieved average Top-1/NDCG scores of 0.35/0.73 for Subtask A and 0.32/0.71 for Subtask B across 15 languages. Ablation results highlight idiom-aware rewriting as the main contributor to performance, while sentence-type prediction and multimodal fusion enhance robustness. These findings suggest that effective idiom disambiguation is feasible without fine-tuning large multimodal encoders.

Abstract: Anxiety is the unease about a possible future negative outcome. In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding how anxiety relates to our health, well-being, body, mind, and behaviour. This includes work on lexical resources for word-anxiety association. However, there is very little anxiety-related work on larger units of text such as multiword expressions (MWE). Here, we introduce the first large-scale lexicon capturing descriptive norms of anxiety associations for more than 20k English MWEs. We show that the anxiety associations are highly reliable. We use the lexicon to study prevalence of different types of anxiety- and calmness-associated MWEs; and how that varies across two-, three-, and four-word sequences. We also study the extent to which the anxiety association of MWEs is compositional (due to its constituent words). The lexicon enables a wide variety of anxiety-related research in psychology, NLP, public health, and social sciences. The lexicon is freely available: https://saifmohammad.com/worrylex.html

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The spread of misinformation across digital platforms can pose significant societal risks. Claim verification, a.k.a. fact-checking, systems can help identify potential misinformation. However, their efficacy is limited by the knowledge sources that they rely on. Most automated claim verification systems depend on a single knowledge source and utilize the supporting evidence from that source; they ignore the disagreement of their source with others. This limits their knowledge coverage and transparency. To address these limitations, we present a novel system for open-domain claim verification (ODCV) that leverages large language models (LLMs), multi-perspective evidence retrieval, and cross-source disagreement analysis. Our approach introduces a novel retrieval strategy that collects evidence for both the original and the negated forms of a claim, enabling the system to capture supporting and contradicting information from diverse sources: Wikipedia, PubMed, and Google. These evidence sets are filtered, deduplicated, and aggregated across sources to form a unified and enriched knowledge base that better reflects the complexity of real-world information. This aggregated evidence is then used for claim verification using LLMs. We further enhance interpretability by analyzing model confidence scores to quantify and visualize inter-source disagreement. Through extensive evaluation on four benchmark datasets with five LLMs, we show that knowledge aggregation not only improves claim verification but also reveals differences in source-specific reasoning. Our findings underscore the importance of embracing diversity, contradiction, and aggregation in evidence for building reliable and transparent claim verification systems

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Most semantic drift studies report multiple signals e.g., embedding displacement, neighbor changes, distributional divergence, and recursive trajectory instability, without a shared explanatory theory that relates them. This paper proposes a formalization of these signals in one time-indexed substrate, $S_t=(X,d_t,P_t)$, combining embedding geometry with local diffusion. Within this substrate, node-level neighborhood drift measures changes in local conditional distributions, coarse Ricci curvature measures local contractivity of semantic diffusion, and recursive drift probes stability of iterated semantic operators. This manuscript specifies the formal model, assumptions, and tests that can refute the model. Herein, the paper introduces bridge mass, a node-level aggregate of incident negative curvature, as a predictor of future neighborhood rewiring. This paper provides the theory and test contracts; empirical performance is deferred to subsequent studies.

Method: 提出ReHear框架，将指令微调、音频感知的大语言模型（LLM）集成到自训练循环中。该方法对LLM进行条件化，使其在语音识别假设和源音频的基础上进行条件化，从而恢复准确的转录文本。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ReHear有效地减轻了错误传播，始终优于监督学习和伪标签基线。

Conclusion: ReHear通过改进伪标签精炼，在自动语音识别中的半监督学习方面取得了显著的成果。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning in automatic speech recognition (ASR) typically relies on pseudo-labeling, which often suffers from confirmation bias and error accumulation due to noisy supervision. To address this limitation, we propose ReHear, a framework for iterative pseudo-label refinement that integrates an instruction-tuned, audio-aware large language model (LLM) into the self-training loop. Unlike conventional text-based correctors, our approach conditions the LLM on both the ASR hypothesis and the source audio, allowing it to recover phonetically accurate transcripts even from severe recognition errors. These refined pseudo-labels serve as high-fidelity targets for fine-tuning the ASR model in an iterative cycle. Experimental results across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that ReHear effectively mitigates error propagation, consistently outperforming both supervised and pseudo-labeling baselines.

Motivation: 许多现有的RAG系统基于排名中心、非对称依赖范式，生成器的生成质量高度依赖于重排序器的重排序结果。

Method: 将RAG重新定义为合作多智能体决策问题，并提出合作检索增强生成（CoRAG）框架。

Result: CoRAG在仅使用约10K PopQA样本进行训练的情况下，表现出良好的泛化能力和改进的生成稳定性。

Conclusion: CoRAG通过合作优化，提高了文档重排序和生成的协同工作效果，从而改善了最终的响应质量。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in knowledge-intensive tasks by grounding language generation in external evidence. Despite its success, many existing RAG systems are built based on a ranking-centric, asymmetric dependency paradigm, where the generation quality of the generator is highly dependent on reranking results of the reranker. To overcome this limitation, we reformulate RAG as a cooperative multi-agent decision-making problem and propose Cooperative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CoRAG), a framework in which the reranker and the generator act as peer decision-makers rather than being connected through an asymmetric dependency pipeline. By jointly optimizing their behaviors toward a shared task objective, the reranker and generator are encouraged to cooperate, ensuring that document reranking and generation work in concert to improve the final response. Experimental results demonstrate good generalization and improved generation stability of CoRAG, even when the model is trained on only around 10K PopQA samples.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在阿拉伯数字阅读任务上的表现

Method: 使用阿拉伯NumBench基准，评估71个模型在210个数字阅读任务上的表现

Result: 发现不同模型和策略在准确性上有显著差异，Chain-of-Thought提示方法效果显著，但精英模型往往产生非结构化输出

Conclusion: 为阿拉伯数字理解建立基准，为模型选择提供指导

Abstract: We present ArabicNumBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large language models on Arabic number reading tasks across Eastern Arabic-Indic numerals (0-9 in Arabic script) and Western Arabic numerals (0-9). We evaluate 71 models from 10 providers using four prompting strategies (zero-shot, zero-shot CoT, few-shot, few-shot CoT) on 210 number reading tasks spanning six contextual categories: pure numerals, addresses, dates, quantities, and prices. Our evaluation comprises 59,010 individual test cases and tracks extraction methods to measure structured output generation. Evaluation reveals substantial performance variation, with accuracy ranging from 14.29\% to 99.05\% across models and strategies. Few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting achieves 2.8x higher accuracy than zero-shot approaches (80.06\% vs 28.76\%). A striking finding emerges: models achieving elite accuracy (98-99\%) often produce predominantly unstructured output, with most responses lacking Arabic CoT markers. Only 6 models consistently generate structured output across all test cases, while the majority require fallback extraction methods despite high numerical accuracy. Comprehensive evaluation of 281 model-strategy combinations demonstrates that numerical accuracy and instruction-following represent distinct capabilities, establishing baselines for Arabic number comprehension and providing actionable guidance for model selection in production Arabic NLP systems.

Conclusion: 发布BURMESE-SAN作为公共排行榜，以支持缅甸语和其他低资源语言的系统评估和持续进步。

Abstract: We introduce BURMESE-SAN, the first holistic benchmark that systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) for Burmese across three core NLP competencies: understanding (NLU), reasoning (NLR), and generation (NLG). BURMESE-SAN consolidates seven subtasks spanning these competencies, including Question Answering, Sentiment Analysis, Toxicity Detection, Causal Reasoning, Natural Language Inference, Abstractive Summarization, and Machine Translation, several of which were previously unavailable for Burmese. The benchmark is constructed through a rigorous native-speaker-driven process to ensure linguistic naturalness, fluency, and cultural authenticity while minimizing translation-induced artifacts. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of both open-weight and commercial LLMs to examine challenges in Burmese modeling arising from limited pretraining coverage, rich morphology, and syntactic variation. Our results show that Burmese performance depends more on architectural design, language representation, and instruction tuning than on model scale alone. In particular, Southeast Asia regional fine-tuning and newer model generations yield substantial gains. Finally, we release BURMESE-SAN as a public leaderboard to support systematic evaluation and sustained progress in Burmese and other low-resource languages. https://leaderboard.sea-lion.ai/detailed/MY

Conclusion: EvalSense为LLMs的评估提供了一种新的方法，有助于减少评估过程中的偏差和误配置，并提高评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Robust and comprehensive evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is essential for identifying effective LLM system configurations and mitigating risks associated with deploying LLMs in sensitive domains. However, traditional statistical metrics are poorly suited to open-ended generation tasks, leading to growing reliance on LLM-based evaluation methods. These methods, while often more flexible, introduce additional complexity: they depend on carefully chosen models, prompts, parameters, and evaluation strategies, making the evaluation process prone to misconfiguration and bias. In this work, we present EvalSense, a flexible, extensible framework for constructing domain-specific evaluation suites for LLMs. EvalSense provides out-of-the-box support for a broad range of model providers and evaluation strategies, and assists users in selecting and deploying suitable evaluation methods for their specific use-cases. This is achieved through two unique components: (1) an interactive guide aiding users in evaluation method selection and (2) automated meta-evaluation tools that assess the reliability of different evaluation approaches using perturbed data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EvalSense in a case study involving the generation of clinical notes from unstructured doctor-patient dialogues, using a popular open dataset. All code, documentation, and assets associated with EvalSense are open-source and publicly available at https://github.com/nhsengland/evalsense.

Motivation: Personal AI agents incur substantial cost via repeated LLM calls.

Method: We observe cache-key evaluation reduces to clustering evaluation and apply V-measure decomposition to separate these on n=8,682 points across MASSIVE, BANKING77, CLINC150, and NyayaBench v2, our new 8,514-entry multilingual agentic dataset (528 intents, 20 W5H2 classes, 63 languages).

On NyayaBench v2 (20 classes), SetFit achieves 55.3%, with cross-lingual transfer across 30 languages. Our five-tier cascade handles 85% of interactions locally, projecting 97.5% cost reduction. We provide risk-controlled selective prediction guarantees via RCPS with nine bound families.

Conclusion: The proposed W5H2 and SetFit methods effectively reduce the cost of LLM calls in personal AI agents and improve the accuracy and efficiency of AI agents.

Abstract: Personal AI agents incur substantial cost via repeated LLM calls. We show existing caching methods fail: GPTCache achieves 37.9% accuracy on real benchmarks; APC achieves 0-12%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sarcasm detection is challenging, especially in low-resource languages like Yorùbá. The need for a gold-standard dataset for Yorùbá sarcasm detection is highlighted.

Method: Collection of a gold-standard dataset (Yor-Sarc) with 436 instances annotated by native Yorùbá speakers using a specific annotation protocol. The protocol considers cultural factors and incorporates context-sensitive interpretation and community-informed guidelines.

Result: Yor-Sarc achieves substantial to almost perfect inter-annotator agreement with Fleiss' κ= 0.7660 and Cohen's κ= 0.6732--0.8743. The dataset facilitates research on semantic interpretation and culturally informed NLP for low-resource African languages.

Conclusion: Yor-Sarc is a valuable resource for sarcasm detection in Yorùbá and potentially other African languages.

Abstract: Sarcasm detection poses a fundamental challenge in computational semantics, requiring models to resolve disparities between literal and intended meaning. The challenge is amplified in low-resource languages where annotated datasets are scarce or nonexistent. We present \textbf{Yor-Sarc}, the first gold-standard dataset for sarcasm detection in Yorùbá, a tonal Niger-Congo language spoken by over $50$ million people. The dataset comprises 436 instances annotated by three native speakers from diverse dialectal backgrounds using an annotation protocol specifically designed for Yorùbá sarcasm by taking culture into account. This protocol incorporates context-sensitive interpretation and community-informed guidelines and is accompanied by a comprehensive analysis of inter-annotator agreement to support replication in other African languages. Substantial to almost perfect agreement was achieved (Fleiss' $κ= 0.7660$; pairwise Cohen's $κ= 0.6732$--$0.8743$), with $83.3\%$ unanimous consensus. One annotator pair achieved almost perfect agreement ($κ= 0.8743$; $93.8\%$ raw agreement), exceeding a number of reported benchmarks for English sarcasm research works. The remaining $16.7\%$ majority-agreement cases are preserved as soft labels for uncertainty-aware modelling. Yor-Sarc\footnote{https://github.com/toheebadura/yor-sarc} is expected to facilitate research on semantic interpretation and culturally informed NLP for low-resource African languages.

### [198] [Capable but Unreliable: Canonical Path Deviation as a Causal Mechanism of Agent Failure in Long-Horizon Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19008)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Why do language agents fail on tasks they are capable of solving? We argue that many such failures are reliability failures caused by stochastic drift from a task's latent solution structure, not capability failures. Every well-defined tool-use task imposes a canonical solution path (i.e., a convergent set of tool invocations shared across successful runs) and agent success depends critically on whether a trajectory stays within this path's operating envelope. We establish this causally using a natural experiment that holds model capability and task difficulty fixed by construction. We analyze trajectories from the Toolathlon benchmark: 22 frontier models each attempt 108 real-world tool-use tasks across 3 independent runs, yielding 515 model$\times$task units where the same model succeeds on some runs and fails on others due to LLM sampling stochasticity alone. Within these units, successful runs adhere significantly more closely to the canonical solution path than failed runs ($+$0.060 Jaccard, $p<0.0001$, $n=488$ units, 95% CI [+0.043, +0.077]). This result survives six robustness checks including cross-model-family leave-one-out validation. Critically, the causal mechanism is gradual and self-reinforcing: the adherence gap is statistically indistinguishable from zero through the first 50% of the trajectory, ruling out early-branching selection bias, and each off-canonical tool call raises the probability that the next call is also off-canonical by 22.7 percentage points ($\hatβ=+0.227$, $p<0.0001$), more than doubling the baseline rate. These findings imply that agent reliability cannot be improved by capability scaling alone, but offer a highly actionable intervention: a simple monitor that restarts the bottom tercile of runs based on mid-trajectory canonical adherence lifts success rates by $+$8.8 percentage points among intervened runs.

Motivation: 为了纠正和更新大型语言模型（LLMs）的内部参数知识，使用真实世界、非结构化的知识进行编辑至关重要。

Result: COIN框架减少了45.2%的上下文依赖，并在编辑成功率上优于强基线23.6%。

Conclusion: 上下文依赖是NTP方法的关键失败模式，COIN框架有助于减轻上下文依赖，从而提高编辑的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Editing Large language models (LLMs) with real-world, unstructured knowledge is essential for correcting and updating their internal parametric knowledge. In this work, we revisit the fundamental next-token prediction (NTP) as a candidate paradigm for unstructured editing. We identify Context Reliance as a critical failure mode of NTP-based approaches, where knowledge acquired from edited text becomes highly dependent on its preceding context, leading to recall failures when that context is absent during inference. This hypothesis is supported by our empirical validation that prepending context during inference recovers knowledge recall. We further theoretically demonstrate that Context Reliance is an inherent consequence of gradient-based optimization, which tends to bind acquired knowledge to a specific aggregated contextual representation. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective COntext-INdependent editing framework (COIN), encouraging model to focus on knowledge within local scope rather than memorizing contextual patterns. Evaluations show that COIN reduces Context Reliance by 45.2% and outperforms strong baselines by 23.6% in editing success rate, highlighting the vital role of mitigating Context Reliance for robust editing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列级奖励塑造方法在控制推理努力在标记间分配方面有限，导致推理时间成本高。

Method: 提出IAPO，一个基于信息论的后训练框架，根据每个标记与最终答案的条件互信息（MI）分配标记优势。

Result: IAPO可以减少推理冗余，提高推理准确率，在推理长度减少36%的同时保持正确性。

Conclusion: 信息感知优势塑造是标记高效后训练的一个强大且通用的方向。

Abstract: Large language models increasingly rely on long chains of thought to improve accuracy, yet such gains come with substantial inference-time costs. We revisit token-efficient post-training and argue that existing sequence-level reward-shaping methods offer limited control over how reasoning effort is allocated across tokens. To bridge the gap, we propose IAPO, an information-theoretic post-training framework that assigns token-wise advantages based on each token's conditional mutual information (MI) with the final answer. This yields an explicit, principled mechanism for identifying informative reasoning steps and suppressing low-utility exploration. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that our IAPO can induce monotonic reductions in reasoning verbosity without harming correctness. Empirically, IAPO consistently improves reasoning accuracy while reducing reasoning length by up to 36%, outperforming existing token-efficient RL methods across various reasoning datasets. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that information-aware advantage shaping is a powerful and general direction for token-efficient post-training. The code is available at https://github.com/YinhanHe123/IAPO.

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLMs和LVLMs的内部计算，并提出了一种参数高效的框架SNRF，将LLMs的推理电路转移到LVLMs，显著提高了LVLMs的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在需要多步推理和组合决策的任务上仍然落后于强大的纯文本大型语言模型（LLMs）的问题，我们受它们共享的转换器架构的启发，研究了这两种模型家族是否依赖于共同的内部计算进行此类推理。

Method: 通过神经元级别的分析，我们发现多步推理期间，超过一半的顶级激活单元在代表性LLMs和LVLMs之间共享，揭示了模态不变的推理子空间。通过因果探测（激活放大），我们进一步表明这些共享神经元编码了一致且可解释的概念级效应，证明了它们对推理的功能贡献。在此基础上，我们提出了共享神经元低秩融合（SNRF），这是一种参数高效的框架，可以将LLMs中成熟的推理电路转移到LVLMs。SNRF通过跨模型激活来识别共享神经元，计算模型间权重差异的低秩近似，并将这些更新选择性地注入共享神经元子空间。

Result: 在数学和感知基准测试中，SNRF一致地增强了LVLM推理性能，同时保留了感知能力。我们的结果表明，共享神经元在LLMs和LVLMs之间形成了一种可解释的桥梁，使推理能力在多模态模型中的低成本迁移成为可能。

Conclusion: 共享神经元在LLMs和LVLMs之间形成了一种可解释的桥梁，使推理能力在多模态模型中的低成本迁移成为可能。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have rapidly advanced across various domains, yet they still lag behind strong text-only large language models (LLMs) on tasks that require multi-step inference and compositional decision-making. Motivated by their shared transformer architectures, we investigate whether the two model families rely on common internal computation for such inference. At the neuron level, we uncover a surprisingly large overlap: more than half of the top-activated units during multi-step inference are shared between representative LLMs and LVLMs, revealing a modality-invariant inference subspace.
  Through causal probing via activation amplification, we further show that these shared neurons encode consistent and interpretable concept-level effects, demonstrating their functional contribution to inference. Building on this insight, we propose Shared Neuron Low-Rank Fusion (SNRF), a parameter-efficient framework that transfers mature inference circuitry from LLMs to LVLMs. SNRF profiles cross-model activations to identify shared neurons, computes a low-rank approximation of inter-model weight differences, and injects these updates selectively within the shared-neuron subspace. This mechanism strengthens multimodal inference performance with minimal parameter changes and requires no large-scale multimodal fine-tuning.
  Across diverse mathematics and perception benchmarks, SNRF consistently enhances LVLM inference performance while preserving perceptual capabilities. Our results demonstrate that shared neurons form an interpretable bridge between LLMs and LVLMs, enabling low-cost transfer of inference ability into multimodal models.

Conclusion: TriTopic在多个数据集上实现了最高的NMI，保证100%语料库覆盖率和0%异常值，且作为开源PyPI库提供。

Abstract: Topic modeling extracts latent themes from large text collections, but leading approaches like BERTopic face critical limitations: stochastic instability, loss of lexical precision ("Embedding Blur"), and reliance on a single data perspective.
  We present TriTopic, a framework that addresses these weaknesses through a tri-modal graph fusing semantic embeddings, TF-IDF, and metadata. Three core innovations drive its performance: hybrid graph construction via Mutual kNN and Shared Nearest Neighbors to eliminate noise and combat the curse of dimensionality; Consensus Leiden Clustering for reproducible, stable partitions; and Iterative Refinement that sharpens embeddings through dynamic centroid-pulling. TriTopic also replaces the "average document" concept with archetype-based topic representations defined by boundary cases rather than centers alone.
  In benchmarks across 20 Newsgroups, BBC News, AG News, and Arxiv, TriTopic achieves the highest NMI on every dataset (mean NMI 0.575 vs. 0.513 for BERTopic, 0.416 for NMF, 0.299 for LDA), guarantees 100% corpus coverage with 0% outliers, and is available as an open-source PyPI library.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的价值一致性，需要我们实证测量这些模型实际获得的价值表示。

Method: 通过探究模型行为、嵌入和残差流激活，评估LLMs是否能够区分三种不同类型的善：道德、语法和经济。

Result: 发现LLMs在这三种价值表示之间存在混淆：语法和经济的估值过度受到道德价值观的影响。通过删除与道德相关的激活向量，可以修复这种混淆。

Conclusion: LLMs的价值表示存在混淆，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Value alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires us to empirically measure these models' actual, acquired representation of value. Among the characteristics of value representation in humans is that they distinguish among value of different kinds. We investigate whether LLMs likewise distinguish three different kinds of good: moral, grammatical, and economic. By probing model behavior, embeddings, and residual stream activations, we report pervasive cases of value entanglement: a conflation between these distinct representations of value. Specifically, both grammatical and economic valuation was found to be overly influenced by moral value, relative to human norms. This conflation was repaired by selective ablation of the activation vectors associated with morality.

TL;DR: Astra是一种基于尾部特征向量的PEFT方法，在自然语言处理任务中表现出色，具有更高的效率和更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LoRA及其变体在适应下游任务时的计算和存储效率，参数高效微调（PEFT）方法被广泛使用。然而，在LoRA及其变体的背景下，对应于尾部特征向量的激活子空间潜力尚未得到充分挖掘，这可能导致微调性能不佳。

Method: 提出了一种名为Astra的新颖PEFT方法，该方法利用从小型特定任务校准集中估计的模型输出激活的尾部特征向量来构建任务自适应的低秩适配器。通过限制对这些尾部特征向量张成的子空间进行更新，Astra实现了更快的收敛和改进的下游性能，同时显著减少了参数预算。

Result: 在自然语言理解（NLU）和自然语言生成（NLG）任务上进行了广泛的实验，结果表明Astra在16个基准测试中始终优于现有的PEFT基线，甚至在某些情况下超过了全微调（FFT）。

Conclusion: Astra在参数高效微调方面具有显著优势，能够提高下游任务的性能，并具有更低的参数预算。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, especially LoRA, are widely used for adapting pre-trained models to downstream tasks due to their computational and storage efficiency. However, in the context of LoRA and its variants, the potential of activation subspaces corresponding to tail eigenvectors remains substantially under-exploited, which may lead to suboptimal fine-tuning performance. In this work, we propose Astra (Activation-Space Tail-Eigenvector Low-Rank Adaptation), a novel PEFT method that leverages the tail eigenvectors of the model output activations-estimated from a small task-specific calibration set-to construct task-adaptive low-rank adapters. By constraining updates to the subspace spanned by these tail eigenvectors, Astra achieves faster convergence and improved downstream performance with a significantly reduced parameter budget. Extensive experiments across natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) tasks demonstrate that Astra consistently outperforms existing PEFT baselines across 16 benchmarks and even surpasses full fine-tuning (FFT) in certain scenarios.

Although some studies have shown that LLMs can, to a certain extent, evaluate research according to perceived quality, our understanding of the internal mechanisms that enable this capability remains limited. This paper presents the first study that investigates how LLMs encode the concept of scientific quality through relevant monosemantic features extracted using sparse autoencoders. We derive such features under different experimental settings and assess their ability to serve as predictors across three tasks related to research quality: predicting citation count, journal SJR, and journal h-index. The results indicate that LLMs encode features associated with multiple dimensions of scientific quality. In particular, we identify four recurring types of features that capture key aspects of how research quality is represented: 1) features reflecting research methodologies; 2) features related to publication type, with literature reviews typically exhibiting higher impact; 3) features associated with high-impact research fields and technologies; and 4) features corresponding to specific scientific jargons. These findings represent an important step toward understanding how LLMs encapsulate concepts related to research quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有基准测试缺乏中间跳转级别问题和手动构建基准的局限性，以及提高模型能力的精细评估。

Method: 构建自动化的AgenticRAG基准测试，支持逐步验证，包含多个领域和1,305个数据点。

Result: 实验表明，即使是最好的大型语言模型在数据集上表现不佳。例如，GPT-5在数据集最困难的部分只达到22.6%的EM准确率。诊断发现，失败主要是由于推理链的扭曲——要么过早地崩溃，要么过度扩展。

Conclusion: 该研究有助于Agentic RAG的研究，并激发该领域进一步有意义的研究进展。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of agent-based methods in recent years, Agentic RAG has undoubtedly become an important research direction. Multi-hop reasoning, which requires models to engage in deliberate thinking and multi-step interaction, serves as a critical testbed for assessing such capabilities. However, existing benchmarks typically provide only final questions and answers, while lacking the intermediate hop-level questions that gradually connect atomic questions to the final multi-hop query. This limitation prevents researchers from analyzing at which step an agent fails and restricts more fine-grained evaluation of model capabilities. Moreover, most current benchmarks are manually constructed, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive, while also limiting scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce AgenticRAGTracer, the first Agentic RAG benchmark that is primarily constructed automatically by large language models and designed to support step-by-step validation. Our benchmark spans multiple domains, contains 1,305 data points, and has no overlap with existing mainstream benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that even the best large language models perform poorly on our dataset. For instance, GPT-5 attains merely 22.6\% EM accuracy on the hardest portion of our dataset. Hop-aware diagnosis reveals that failures are primarily driven by distorted reasoning chains -- either collapsing prematurely or wandering into over-extension. This highlights a critical inability to allocate steps consistent with the task's logical structure, providing a diagnostic dimension missing in traditional evaluations. We believe our work will facilitate research in Agentic RAG and inspire further meaningful progress in this area. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/YqjMartin/AgenticRAGTracer.

Conclusion: FRAME数据集为艺术历史图像描述的NER和RE任务提供了高质量的数据资源

Abstract: This paper introduces FRAME (Fine-grained Recognition of Art-historical Metadata and Entities), a manually annotated dataset of art-historical image descriptions for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE). Descriptions were collected from museum catalogs, auction listings, open-access platforms, and scholarly databases, then filtered to ensure that each text focuses on a single artwork and contains explicit statements about its material, composition, or iconography. FRAME provides stand-off annotations in three layers: a metadata layer for object-level properties, a content layer for depicted subjects and motifs, and a co-reference layer linking repeated mentions. Across layers, entity spans are labeled with 37 types and connected by typed RE links between mentions. Entity types are aligned with Wikidata to support Named Entity Linking (NEL) and downstream knowledge-graph construction. The dataset is released as UIMA XMI Common Analysis Structure (CAS) files with accompanying images and bibliographic metadata, and can be used to benchmark and fine-tune NER and RE systems, including zero- and few-shot setups with Large Language Models (LLMs).

Motivation: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in social science research

Conclusion: the need for more sophisticated prompting techniques and specialized datasets to ensure the accuracy of LLM-generated content

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as proxies for human participants in social science research presents a promising, yet methodologically risky, paradigm shift. While LLMs offer scalability and cost-efficiency, their "naive" application, where they are prompted to generate content without explicit behavioral constraints, introduces significant linguistic discrepancies that challenge the validity of research findings. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing a novel, history-conditioned reply prediction task on authentic X (formerly Twitter) data, to create a dataset designed to evaluate the linguistic output of LLMs against human-generated content. We analyze these discrepancies using stylistic and content-based metrics, providing a quantitative framework for researchers to assess the quality and authenticity of synthetic data. Our findings highlight the need for more sophisticated prompting techniques and specialized datasets to ensure that LLM-generated content accurately reflects the complex linguistic patterns of human communication, thereby improving the validity of computational social science studies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Hateful content on social media increasingly appears as multimodal memes that combine images and text to convey harmful narratives. In low-resource languages such as Bengali, automated detection remains challenging due to limited annotated data, class imbalance, and pervasive code-mixing. To address these issues, we augment the Bengali Hateful Memes (BHM) dataset with semantically aligned samples from the Multimodal Aggression Dataset in Bengali (MIMOSA), improving both class balance and semantic diversity. We propose the Enhanced Dual Co-attention Framework (xDORA), integrating vision encoders (CLIP, DINOv2) and multilingual text encoders (XGLM, XLM-R) via weighted attention pooling to learn robust cross-modal representations. Building on these embeddings, we develop a FAISS-based k-nearest neighbor classifier for non-parametric inference and introduce RAG-Fused DORA, which incorporates retrieval-driven contextual reasoning. We further evaluate LLaVA under zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented prompting settings. Experiments on the extended dataset show that xDORA (CLIP + XLM-R) achieves macro-average F1-scores of 0.78 for hateful meme identification and 0.71 for target entity detection, while RAG-Fused DORA improves performance to 0.79 and 0.74, yielding gains over the DORA baseline. The FAISS-based classifier performs competitively and demonstrates robustness for rare classes through semantic similarity modeling. In contrast, LLaVA exhibits limited effectiveness in few-shot settings, with only modest improvements under retrieval augmentation, highlighting constraints of pretrained vision-language models for code-mixed Bengali content without fine-tuning. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of supervised, retrieval-augmented, and non-parametric multimodal frameworks for addressing linguistic and cultural complexities in low-resource hate speech detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提供更符合用户背景、偏好和历史情境的个性化问答结果，现有方法主要依赖于检索增强生成（RAG）解决方案，通过检索用户个人资料中的相关项目来构建个人上下文。

Method: 提出了一种名为PR2的强化学习框架，该框架集成了来自个人上下文的推理和检索，以实现个性化。PR2学习自适应的检索-推理策略，确定何时检索，从用户资料中检索哪些证据，以及如何将其纳入中间推理步骤。通过优化个性化奖励函数下的多轮推理轨迹，该框架加强了与用户特定偏好和奖励模型反映的上下文信号更好地一致的推理路径。

Result: 在LaMP-QA基准测试中，使用三种LLMs进行的大量实验表明，PR2在个性化问答方面一致优于强基线，平均相对提高了8.8%-12%。

Conclusion: PR2在个性化问答方面表现出色，能够显著提高问答的准确性。

Abstract: Personalization in Question Answering (QA) requires answers that are both accurate and aligned with users' background, preferences, and historical context. Existing state-of-the-art methods primarily rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) solutions that construct personal context by retrieving relevant items from the user's profile. Existing methods use the user's query directly to retrieve personal documents, and such strategies often lead to surface-level personalization. We propose PR2 (Personalized Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning), a reinforcement learning framework that integrates reasoning and retrieval from personal context for personalization. PR2 learns adaptive retrieval-reasoning policies, determining when to retrieve, what evidence to retrieve from user profiles, and how to incorporate it into intermediate reasoning steps. By optimizing multi-turn reasoning trajectories under a personalized reward function, the framework reinforces reasoning paths that better align with user-specific preferences and contextual signals reflected by the reward model. Extensive experiments on the LaMP-QA benchmark using three LLMs show that PR2 consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving an average relative improvement of 8.8%-12% in personalized QA.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了选择和优化个性化戒烟干预信息，评估潜在干预用户对信息有效性的感知（PME）对移动健康（mHealth）平台具有重要意义。

Method: 本研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在预测戒烟信息PME方面的准确性。评估了多个模型在三个领域的PME预测，包括内容质量、应对支持和戒烟支持。数据集包括3010条消息评级（5点李克特量表）来自301名年轻吸烟者。比较了（1）在标记数据上训练的监督学习模型，（2）未进行任务特定微调的零和少样本LLMs，以及（3）基于LLM的数字孪生，它结合了个人特征和先前的PME历史记录以生成个性化预测。使用准确度、Cohen's kappa和F1在每位参与者的三个保留消息上评估了模型性能。

Result: 基于LLM的数字孪生优于零和少样本LLMs（平均12个百分点）和监督基线（13个百分点），在内容、应对和戒烟方面的准确率分别为0.49、0.45和0.49，在简化的3点量表上的方向准确率为0.75、0.66和0.70。数字孪生预测在评级类别之间显示出更大的分散性，表明提高了对个体差异的敏感性。将个人资料与LLMs相结合可以捕捉到PME的个体差异，并优于监督和零和少样本方法。改进的PME预测可能使mHealth中的干预内容更加个性化。基于LLM的数字孪生有望支持个性化移动戒烟和其他健康行为改变干预。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的数字孪生在预测戒烟信息PME方面表现出色，有望在mHealth中实现个性化干预。

Abstract: Perceived message effectiveness (PME) by potential intervention end-users is important for selecting and optimizing personalized smoking cessation intervention messages for mobile health (mHealth) platform delivery. This study evaluates whether large language models (LLMs) can accurately predict PME for smoking cessation messages.
  We evaluated multiple models for predicting PME across three domains: content quality, coping support, and quitting support. The dataset comprised 3010 message ratings (5-point Likert scale) from 301 young adult smokers. We compared (1) supervised learning models trained on labeled data, (2) zero and few-shot LLMs prompted without task-specific fine-tuning, and (3) LLM-based digital twins that incorporate individual characteristics and prior PME histories to generate personalized predictions. Model performance was assessed on three held-out messages per participant using accuracy, Cohen's kappa, and F1.
  LLM-based digital twins outperformed zero and few-shot LLMs (12 percentage points on average) and supervised baselines (13 percentage points), achieving accuracies of 0.49 (content), 0.45 (coping), and 0.49 (quitting), with directional accuracies of 0.75, 0.66, and 0.70 on a simplified 3-point scale. Digital twin predictions showed greater dispersion across rating categories, indicating improved sensitivity to individual differences.
  Integrating personal profiles with LLMs captures person-specific differences in PME and outperforms supervised and zero and few-shot approaches. Improved PME prediction may enable more tailored intervention content in mHealth. LLM-based digital twins show potential for supporting personalization of mobile smoking cessation and other health behavior change interventions.

Motivation: 为了全面理解强化学习在深度研究中的角色，作者进行了一项系统的实验研究。

Method: 作者通过三个解耦的维度进行系统研究：提示模板、奖励函数和政策优化。

Result: 研究发现，Fast Thinking模板比Slow Thinking模板具有更好的稳定性和性能；基于F1的奖励函数在避免答案的情况下导致训练崩溃，而行动级别的惩罚可以缓解这个问题；REINFORCE在搜索动作较少的情况下优于PPO，而GRPO在策略优化方法中表现最差。

Conclusion: 基于这些发现，作者提出了Search-R1++，这是一个强大的基线，将Search-R1的性能从0.403提高到0.442（Qwen2.5-7B）和从0.289提高到0.331（Qwen2.5-3B）。

Abstract: Deep Research agents tackle knowledge-intensive tasks through multi-round retrieval and decision-oriented generation. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to improve performance in this paradigm, its contributions remain underexplored. To fully understand the role of RL, we conduct a systematic study along three decoupled dimensions: prompt template, reward function, and policy optimization. Our study reveals that: 1) the Fast Thinking template yields greater stability and better performance than the Slow Thinking template used in prior work; 2) the F1-based reward underperforms the EM due to training collapse driven by answer avoidance; this can be mitigated by incorporating action-level penalties, ultimately surpassing EM; 3) REINFORCE outperforms PPO while requiring fewer search actions, whereas GRPO shows the poorest stability among policy optimization methods. Building on these insights, we then introduce Search-R1++, a strong baseline that improves the performance of Search-R1 from 0.403 to 0.442 (Qwen2.5-7B) and 0.289 to 0.331 (Qwen2.5-3B). We hope that our findings can pave the way for more principled and reliable RL training strategies in Deep Research systems.

Result: Hyper-KGGen在多场景设置中显著优于基线，验证了演化技能在指导知识超图提取中的优越性。

Conclusion: Hyper-KGGen能够有效解决场景差距问题，提高知识超图提取的质量。

Abstract: Knowledge hypergraphs surpass traditional binary knowledge graphs by encapsulating complex $n$-ary atomic facts, providing a more comprehensive paradigm for semantic representation. However, constructing high-quality hypergraphs remains challenging due to the \textit{scenario gap}: generic extractors struggle to generalize across diverse domains with specific jargon, while existing methods often fail to balance structural skeletons with fine-grained details. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{Hyper-KGGen}, a skill-driven framework that reformulates extraction as a dynamic skill-evolving process. First, Hyper-KGGen employs a \textit{coarse-to-fine} mechanism to systematically decompose documents, ensuring full-dimensional coverage from binary links to complex hyperedges. Crucially, it incorporates an \textit{adaptive skill acquisition} module that actively distills domain expertise into a Global Skill Library. This is achieved via a stability-based feedback loop, where extraction stability serves as a relative reward signal to induce high-quality skills from unstable traces and missed predictions. Additionally, we present \textbf{HyperDocRED}, a rigorously annotated benchmark for document-level knowledge hypergraph extraction. Experiments demonstrate that Hyper-KGGen significantly outperforms strong baselines, validating that evolved skills provide substantially richer guidance than static few-shot examples in multi-scenario settings.

Conclusion: 使用不同提取器可以提高数据集的覆盖率和利用效率，并对模型性能产生积极影响。

Abstract: One of the first pre-processing steps for constructing web-scale LLM pretraining datasets involves extracting text from HTML. Despite the immense diversity of web content, existing open-source datasets predominantly apply a single fixed extractor to all webpages. In this work, we investigate whether this practice leads to suboptimal coverage and utilization of Internet data. We first show that while different extractors may lead to similar model performance on standard language understanding tasks, the pages surviving a fixed filtering pipeline can differ substantially. This suggests a simple intervention: by taking a Union over different extractors, we can increase the token yield of DCLM-Baseline by up to 71% while maintaining benchmark performance. We further show that for structured content such as tables and code blocks, extractor choice can significantly impact downstream task performance, with differences of up to 10 percentage points (p.p.) on WikiTQ and 3 p.p. on HumanEval.

Conclusion: Prune-then-Merge 框架有效解决了 VDR 中的压缩率与特征保真度之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Visual Document Retrieval (VDR), which aims to retrieve relevant pages within vast corpora of visually-rich documents, is of significance in current multimodal retrieval applications. The state-of-the-art multi-vector paradigm excels in performance but suffers from prohibitive overhead, a problem that current efficiency methods like pruning and merging address imperfectly, creating a difficult trade-off between compression rate and feature fidelity. To overcome this dilemma, we introduce Prune-then-Merge, a novel two-stage framework that synergizes these complementary approaches. Our method first employs an adaptive pruning stage to filter out low-information patches, creating a refined, high-signal set of embeddings. Subsequently, a hierarchical merging stage compresses this pre-filtered set, effectively summarizing semantic content without the noise-induced feature dilution seen in single-stage methods. Extensive experiments on 29 VDR datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms existing methods, significantly extending the near-lossless compression range and providing robust performance at high compression ratios.

Conclusion: 该框架在处理时间敏感查询方面具有显著优势

Abstract: Question Answering over Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGQA) has attracted growing interest for handling time-sensitive queries. However, existing methods still struggle with: 1) weak incorporation of temporal constraints in question representation, causing biased reasoning; 2) limited ability to perform explicit multi-hop reasoning; and 3) suboptimal fusion of language and graph representations. We propose a novel framework with temporal-aware question encoding, multi-hop graph reasoning, and multi-view heterogeneous information fusion. Specifically, our approach introduces: 1) a constraint-aware question representation that combines semantic cues from language models with temporal entity dynamics; 2) a temporal-aware graph neural network for explicit multi-hop reasoning via time-aware message passing; and 3) a multi-view attention mechanism for more effective fusion of question context and temporal graph knowledge. Experiments on multiple TKGQA benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over multiple baselines.

Abstract: Comparative evaluation of several systems is a recurrent task in researching. It is a key step before deciding which system to use for our work, or, once our research has been conducted, to demonstrate the potential of the resulting model. Furthermore, it is the main task of competitive, public challenges evaluation. Our proposed software (DEEP) automates both the execution and scoring of machine translation and optical character recognition models. Furthermore, it is easily extensible to other tasks. DEEP is prepared to receive dockerized systems, run them (extracting information at that same time), and assess hypothesis against some references. With this approach, evaluators can achieve a better understanding of the performance of each model. Moreover, the software uses a clustering algorithm based on a statistical analysis of the significance of the results yielded by each model, according to the evaluation metrics. As a result, evaluators are able to identify clusters of performance among the swarm of proposals and have a better understanding of the significance of their differences. Additionally, we offer a visualization web-app to ensure that the results can be adequately understood and interpreted. Finally, we present an exemplary case of use of DEEP.

Abstract: Eye-tracking-while-reading corpora are a valuable resource for many different disciplines and use cases. Use cases range from studying the cognitive processes underlying reading to machine-learning-based applications, such as gaze-based assessments of reading comprehension. The past decades have seen an increase in the number and size of eye-tracking-while-reading datasets as well as increasing diversity with regard to the stimulus languages covered, the linguistic background of the participants, or accompanying psychometric or demographic data. The spread of data across different disciplines and the lack of data sharing standards across the communities lead to many existing datasets that cannot be easily reused due to a lack of interoperability. In this work, we aim at creating more transparency and clarity with regards to existing datasets and their features across different disciplines by i) presenting an extensive overview of existing datasets, ii) simplifying the sharing of newly created datasets by publishing a living overview online, https://dili-lab.github.io/datasets.html, presenting over 45 features for each dataset, and iii) integrating all publicly available datasets into the Python package pymovements which offers an eye-tracking datasets library. By doing so, we aim to strengthen the FAIR principles in eye-tracking-while-reading research and promote good scientific practices, such as reproducing and replicating studies.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to remove unsafe or outdated information. However, existing work assumes that all facts are equally forgettable and largely ignores whether the forgotten knowledge originates from pretraining or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In this paper, we introduce DUAL (Dual Unlearning Evaluation across Training Stages), a benchmark of 28.6k Wikidata-derived triplets annotated with fact popularity using Wikipedia link counts and LLM-based salience scores. Our experiments show that pretrained and SFT models respond differently to unlearning. An SFT step on the forget data yields smoother forgetting, more stable tuning, and 10-50% higher retention, while direct unlearning on pretrained models remains unstable and prone to relearning or catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: KGHalubench为LLMs的幻觉缓解提供支持

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess a remarkable capacity to generate persuasive and intelligible language. However, coherence does not equate to truthfulness, as the responses often contain subtle hallucinations. Existing benchmarks are limited by static and narrow questions, leading to limited coverage and misleading evaluations. We present KGHaluBench, a Knowledge Graph-based hallucination benchmark that assesses LLMs across the breadth and depth of their knowledge, providing a fairer and more comprehensive insight into LLM truthfulness. Our framework utilises the KG to dynamically construct challenging, multifaceted questions, whose difficulty is then statistically estimated to address popularity bias. Our automated verification pipeline detects abstentions and verifies the LLM's response at both conceptual and correctness levels to identify different types of hallucinations. We evaluate 25 frontier models, using novel accuracy and hallucination metrics. The results provide a more interpretable insight into the knowledge factors that cause hallucinations across different model sizes. KGHaluBench is publicly available to support future developments in hallucination mitigation.

Abstract: We present a mobile and desktop keyboard suite for Idu Mishmi, an endangered Trans-Himalayan language spoken by approximately 11,000 people in Arunachal Pradesh, India. Although a Latin-based orthography was developed in 2018, no digital input tools existed to use it, forcing speakers into ad-hoc romanizations that cannot represent the full writing system. Our keyboards comprise two tools: (1) an Android mobile keyboard, published on the Google Play Store and actively used in teacher training programs, and (2) a Windows desktop keyboard currently undergoing community testing. Both tools support the complete Idu Mishmi character inventory, including schwa, retracted schwa, nasalized vowels, and accented forms. Both operate fully offline with zero network permissions, addressing connectivity constraints and data sovereignty concerns. We describe the design, implementation, and deployment as a replicable model for other endangered language communities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在生成流畅、忠实于原文的翻译方面表现出色，但在保留作者独特的文学风格方面存在困难。

Method: 提出了一种名为Style-Adaptive Multi-Agent System (SAMAS)的新型框架，将风格保留视为信号处理任务。使用小波包变换将文学风格量化为风格特征谱（SFS），作为控制信号动态组装针对源文本结构模式的定制工作流程。

Result: 在翻译基准测试中，SAMAS在语义准确性和风格忠实度方面均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SAMAS在保持文学风格方面表现出色，为翻译领域提供了一种新的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent and faithful translations. However, they struggle to preserve an author's unique literary style, often producing semantically correct but generic outputs. This limitation stems from the inability of current single-model and static multi-agent systems to perceive and adapt to stylistic variations. To address this, we introduce the Style-Adaptive Multi-Agent System (SAMAS), a novel framework that treats style preservation as a signal processing task. Specifically, our method quantifies literary style into a Stylistic Feature Spectrum (SFS) using the wavelet packet transform. This SFS serves as a control signal to dynamically assemble a tailored workflow of specialized translation agents based on the source text's structural patterns. Extensive experiments on translation benchmarks show that SAMAS achieves competitive semantic accuracy against strong baselines, primarily by leveraging its statistically significant advantage in style fidelity.

Conclusion: SHIELD方法可以增强临床试验中的安全评估和因果解释

Abstract: We present SHIELD, a novel methodology for automated and integrated safety signal detection in clinical trials. SHIELD combines disproportionality analysis with semantic clustering of adverse event (AE) terms applied to MedDRA term embeddings. For each AE, the pipeline computes an information-theoretic disproportionality measure (Information Component) with effect size derived via empirical Bayesian shrinkage. A utility matrix is constructed by weighting semantic term-term similarities by signal magnitude, followed by spectral embedding and clustering to identify groups of related AEs. Resulting clusters are annotated with syndrome-level summary labels using large language models, yielding a coherent, data-driven representation of treatment-associated safety profiles in the form of a network graph and hierarchical tree. We implement the SHIELD framework in the context of a single-arm incidence summary, to compare two treatment arms or for the detection of any treatment effect in a multi-arm trial. We illustrate its ability to recover known safety signals and generate interpretable, cluster-based summaries in a real clinical trial example. This work bridges statistical signal detection with modern natural language processing to enhance safety assessment and causal interpretation in clinical trials.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Janus-Q是一种基于文本的金融新闻事件驱动的交易框架，在提高交易决策的准确性和盈利性方面取得了显著成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融市场运动通常由新闻中传达的离散金融事件驱动，其影响异质、突然且难以在纯数值预测目标下捕捉。这些局限性促使人们越来越关注将文本信息作为学习型系统交易信号的主要来源。现有方法面临两个关键挑战：(1)缺乏大型、事件中心的数据集，这些数据集同时建模新闻语义和基于统计的市场反应；(2)在动态市场条件下，语言模型推理与有效的交易行为之间存在不匹配。

Method: 我们提出了Janus-Q，一个端到端的事件驱动交易框架，将金融新闻事件从辅助信号提升到主要决策单元。Janus-Q在两阶段范式下统一了事件中心的数据构建和模型优化。第一阶段专注于事件中心的数据构建，构建了一个包含62,400篇文章的大型金融新闻事件数据集，这些文章标注了10种细粒度事件类型、相关股票、情感标签和事件驱动的累积异常回报（CAR）。第二阶段执行决策导向的微调，结合监督学习和由分层门控奖励模型（HGRM）引导的强化学习，该模型明确捕捉多个交易目标之间的权衡。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，与市场指数和LLM基线相比，Janus-Q实现了更一致、可解释和有利可图的交易决策，将夏普比率提高了高达102.0%，与最强竞争策略相比，方向准确性提高了17.5%以上。

Conclusion: Janus-Q在处理金融新闻事件对市场的影响方面表现出色，为事件驱动的交易系统提供了有效的方法。

Abstract: Financial market movements are often driven by discrete financial events conveyed through news, whose impacts are heterogeneous, abrupt, and difficult to capture under purely numerical prediction objectives. These limitations have motivated growing interest in using textual information as the primary source of trading signals in learning-based systems. Two key challenges hinder existing approaches: (1) the absence of large-scale, event-centric datasets that jointly model news semantics and statistically grounded market reactions, and (2) the misalignment between language model reasoning and financially valid trading behavior under dynamic market conditions. To address these challenges, we propose Janus-Q, an end-to-end event-driven trading framework that elevates financial news events from auxiliary signals to primary decision units. Janus-Q unifies event-centric data construction and model optimization under a two-stage paradigm. Stage I focuses on event-centric data construction, building a large-scale financial news event dataset comprising 62,400 articles annotated with 10 fine-grained event types, associated stocks, sentiment labels, and event-driven cumulative abnormal return (CAR). Stage II performs decision-oriented fine-tuning, combining supervised learning with reinforcement learning guided by a Hierarchical Gated Reward Model (HGRM), which explicitly captures trade-offs among multiple trading objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Janus-Q achieves more consistent, interpretable, and profitable trading decisions than market indices and LLM baselines, improving the Sharpe Ratio by up to 102.0% while increasing direction accuracy by over 17.5% compared to the strongest competing strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期大型语言模型（LLMs）在零样本重排序任务中的强大能力使其成为高效且可解释的替代方案。然而，基于注意力的重排序方法存在两个主要限制。

Method: 提出了一种名为ReAttn的重排序策略，通过跨文档IDF加权来降低查询重叠的频繁出现于候选文档的注意力，减少词汇偏差并强调独特术语。然后，它采用基于熵的正则化来减轻过度集中的注意力，鼓励更平衡地分配到信息丰富的标记上。

Result: 实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效减轻基于注意力的重排序方法的限制，提高重排序的准确性。

Abstract: The strong capabilities of recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have made them highly effective for zero-shot re-ranking task. Attention-based re-ranking methods, which derive relevance scores directly from attention weights, offer an efficient and interpretable alternative to generation-based re-ranking methods. However, they still face two major limitations. First, attention signals are highly concentrated a small subset of tokens within a few documents, making others indistinguishable. Second, attention often overemphasizes phrases lexically similar to the query, yielding biased rankings that irrelevant documents with mere lexical resemblance are regarded as relevant. In this paper, we propose \textbf{ReAttn}, a post-hoc re-weighting strategy for attention-based re-ranking methods. It first compute the cross-document IDF weighting to down-weight attention on query-overlapping tokens that frequently appear across the candidate documents, reducing lexical bias and emphasizing distinctive terms. It then employs entropy-based regularization to mitigate over-concentrated attention, encouraging a more balanced distribution across informative tokens. Both adjustments operate directly on existing attention weights without additional training or supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Method: 训练首个双语语音-文本马雅罗什卡嵌入模型，并引入大规模数据整理流程和新基准，比较建模策略。

Result: 模型在检索任务中表现最佳，且泛化到其他任务如语音意图检测，显示出对通用语义表示的学习。分析马雅罗什卡维度和排名的成本-精度权衡，发现信息主要集中在少数几个组件中，暗示着效率提升的潜力。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决未充分代表的语言使用者在获取在线知识时面临的语言和模态障碍提供了有效的方法，并展示了马雅罗什卡模型在处理语音-文本检索任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Speakers of under-represented languages face both a language barrier, as most online knowledge is in a few dominant languages, and a modality barrier, since information is largely text-based while many languages are primarily oral. We address this for French-Wolof by training the first bilingual speech-text Matryoshka embedding model, enabling efficient retrieval of French text from Wolof speech queries without relying on a costly ASR-translation pipelines. We introduce large-scale data curation pipelines and new benchmarks, compare modeling strategies, and show that modality fusion within a frozen text Matryoshka model performs best. Although trained only for retrieval, the model generalizes well to other tasks, such as speech intent detection, indicating the learning of general semantic representations. Finally, we analyze cost-accuracy trade-offs across Matryoshka dimensions and ranks, showing that information is concentrated only in a few components, suggesting potential for efficiency improvements.

Motivation: 处理现实世界表格中的不规则模式、异构值格式和隐含关系结构，提高下游推理和问答的可靠性。

Method: 提出QuIeTT，一个查询无关的表格转换框架，在观察任何测试查询之前预处理原始表格到单个SQL就绪的规范表示。

Result: 通过解耦表格转换和推理，QuIeTT实现了更清洁、更可靠和高度高效的查询，而不修改下游模型。在四个基准测试中，WikiTQ、HiTab、NQ-Table和SequentialQA，QuIeTT在模型和推理范式上表现出持续的优势，特别是在结构多样、未见过的挑战集上表现强劲。

Conclusion: QuIeTT有效地提高了表格推理和问答的可靠性，并展示了在多种场景下的优越性能。

Abstract: Real-world tables often exhibit irregular schemas, heterogeneous value formats, and implicit relational structure, which degrade the reliability of downstream table reasoning and question answering. Most existing approaches address these issues in a query-dependent manner, entangling table cleanup with reasoning and thus limiting generalization. We introduce QuIeTT, a query-independent table transformation framework that preprocesses raw tables into a single SQL-ready canonical representation before any test-time queries are observed. QuIeTT performs lossless schema and value normalization, exposes implicit relations, and preserves full provenance via raw table snapshots. By decoupling table transformation from reasoning, QuIeTT enables cleaner, more reliable, and highly efficient querying without modifying downstream models. Experiments on four benchmarks, WikiTQ, HiTab, NQ-Table, and SequentialQA show consistent gains across models and reasoning paradigms, with particularly strong improvements on a challenge set of structurally diverse, unseen questions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的计算机化自适应测试（CAT）框架通常基于预测学生对问题的正确答案。尽管这种方法有效，但它未能利用问题和回答中的文本信息，尤其是对于开放式问题。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种名为GENCAT（	extbf{GEN}erative 	extbf{CAT}）的新型CAT框架，该框架利用大型语言模型进行知识估计和问题选择。

Method: 我们首先开发了一种生成性项目反应理论（GIRT）模型，可以从学生的开放式回答中估计学生的知识，并预测未见过的问题的回答。我们通过监督微调和偏好优化来训练模型，以实现知识-回答对齐。其次，我们引入了三种基于不确定性、语言多样性和抽样学生回答信息的GIRT模型生成能力的问句选择算法。最后，我们在两个现实世界的编程数据集上进行了实验，结果表明GENCAT优于现有的CAT基准，在关键早期测试阶段实现了AUC提高4.32%的效果。

Result: 在两个现实世界的编程数据集上进行的实验表明，GENCAT优于现有的CAT基准，在关键早期测试阶段实现了AUC提高4.32%的效果。

Conclusion: GENCAT通过利用大型语言模型进行知识估计和问题选择，在计算机化自适应测试（CAT）中表现出色，提高了测试的准确性。

Abstract: Existing computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) frameworks are typically built on predicting the correctness of a student response to a question. Although effective, this approach fails to leverage textual information in questions and responses, especially for open-ended questions. In this work, we propose GENCAT (\textbf{GEN}erative \textbf{CAT}), a novel CAT framework that leverages Large Language Models for knowledge estimate and question selection. First, we develop a Generative Item Response Theory (GIRT) model that enables us to estimate student knowledge from their open-ended responses and predict responses to unseen questions. We train the model in a two-step process, first via Supervised Fine-Tuning and then via preference optimization for knowledge-response alignment. Second, we introduce three question selection algorithms that leverage the generative capabilities of the GIRT model, based on the uncertainty, linguistic diversity, and information of sampled student responses. Third, we conduct experiments on two real-world programming datasets and demonstrate that GENCAT outperforms existing CAT baselines, achieving an AUC improvement of up to 4.32\% in the key early testing stages.

Conclusion: 将对齐重新定义为动态规范治理的生命周期问题，而不是单次实例优化任务。

Abstract: Large language models are being deployed in complex socio-technical systems, which exposes limits in current alignment practice. We take the position that the dominant paradigm of General Alignment, which compresses diverse human values into a single scalar reward, reaches a structural ceiling in settings with conflicting values, plural stakeholders, and irreducible uncertainty. These failures follow from the mathematics and incentives of scalarization and lead to \textbf{structural} value flattening, \textbf{normative} representation loss, and \textbf{cognitive} uncertainty blindness. We introduce Edge Alignment as a distinct approach in which systems preserve multi dimensional value structure, support plural and democratic representation, and incorporate epistemic mechanisms for interaction and clarification. To make this approach practical, we propose seven interdependent pillars organized into three phases. We identify key challenges in data collection, training objectives, and evaluation, outlining complementary technical and governance directions. Taken together, these measures reframe alignment as a lifecycle problem of dynamic normative governance rather than as a single instance optimization task.

Method: 假设现代LLM的概率性，使用常数随机分布来对LLM进行概率建模，并与自然语言（书面或口语）的词熵进行比较，该自然语言由开放美国国家语料库（OANC）表示。

Result: 结果表明，这类LLM的词熵低于自然语言的词熵（书面或口语形式）。

Conclusion: 此类研究的长远目标是正式化大型语言训练中关于信息和不确定性的直觉，以评估从LLM生成训练数据中训练LLM的影响。

Abstract: In this study, the output of large language models (LLM) is considered an information source generating an unlimited sequence of symbols drawn from a finite alphabet. Given the probabilistic nature of modern LLMs, we assume a probabilistic model for these LLMs, following a constant random distribution and the source itself thus being stationary. We compare this source entropy (per word) to that of natural language (written or spoken) as represented by the Open American National Corpus (OANC). Our results indicate that the word entropy of such LLMs is lower than the word entropy of natural speech both in written or spoken form. The long-term goal of such studies is to formalize the intuitions of information and uncertainty in large language training to assess the impact of training an LLM from LLM generated training data. This refers to texts from the world wide web in particular.

Conclusion: LLMs在不同语言中的表现存在差异，需要考虑多种因素，如标记化、语言距离、训练数据大小和数据来源

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) play a critical role in how humans access information. While their core use relies on comprehending written requests, our understanding of this ability is currently limited, because most benchmarks evaluate LLMs in high-resource languages predominantly spoken by Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) communities. The default assumption is that English is the best-performing language for LLMs, while smaller, low-resource languages are linked to less reliable outputs, even in multilingual, state-of-the-art models. To track variation in the comprehension abilities of LLMs, we prompt 3 popular models on a language comprehension task across 12 languages, representing the Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic, Turkic, Sino-Tibetan, and Japonic language families. Our results suggest that the models exhibit remarkable linguistic accuracy across typologically diverse languages, yet they fall behind human baselines in all of them, albeit to different degrees. Contrary to what was expected, English is not the best-performing language, as it was systematically outperformed by several Romance languages, even lower-resource ones. We frame the results by discussing the role of several factors that drive LLM performance, such as tokenization, language distance from Spanish and English, size of training data, and data origin in high- vs. low-resource languages and WEIRD vs. non-WEIRD communities.

Result: 发现上下文相关性和层次化处理如何影响内部表示，为LLM输出行为提供解释，并为RAG系统设计提供见解。

Conclusion: 通过研究LLM的内部表示，揭示了RAG模型中检索上下文的作用，有助于理解和改进RAG系统。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by conditioning generation on retrieved external documents, but the effect of retrieved context is often non-trivial. In realistic retrieval settings, the retrieved document set often contains a mixture of documents that vary in relevance and usefulness. While prior work has largely examined these phenomena through output behavior, little is known about how retrieved context shapes the internal representations that mediate information integration in RAG. In this work, we study RAG through the lens of latent representations. We systematically analyze how different types of retrieved documents affect the hidden states of LLMs, and how these internal representation shifts relate to downstream generation behavior. Across four question-answering datasets and three LLMs, we analyze internal representations under controlled single- and multi-document settings. Our results reveal how context relevancy and layer-wise processing influence internal representations, providing explanations on LLMs output behaviors and insights for RAG system design.

Result: 实验结果表明，模型在预训练过程中看到的答案更准确，即使提供了外部证据。非相关信息的存在也会降低准确性。

Conclusion: NanoKnow有助于理解LLMs的知识来源，并揭示了参数知识和外部知识的互补性。

Abstract: How do large language models (LLMs) know what they know? Answering this question has been difficult because pre-training data is often a "black box" -- unknown or inaccessible. The recent release of nanochat -- a family of small LLMs with fully open pre-training data -- addresses this as it provides a transparent view into where a model's parametric knowledge comes from. Towards the goal of understanding how knowledge is encoded by LLMs, we release NanoKnow, a benchmark dataset that partitions questions from Natural Questions and SQuAD into splits based on whether their answers are present in nanochat's pre-training corpus. Using these splits, we can now properly disentangle the sources of knowledge that LLMs rely on when producing an output. To demonstrate NanoKnow's utility, we conduct experiments using eight nanochat checkpoints. Our findings show: (1) closed-book accuracy is strongly influenced by answer frequency in the pre-training data, (2) providing external evidence can mitigate this frequency dependence, (3) even with external evidence, models are more accurate when answers were seen during pre-training, demonstrating that parametric and external knowledge are complementary, and (4) non-relevant information is harmful, with accuracy decreasing based on both the position and the number of non-relevant contexts. We release all NanoKnow artifacts at https://github.com/castorini/NanoKnow.

Conclusion: KNIGHT是一个有效的LLMs评估工具，可以生成高质量的MCQ数据集，支持特定主题和难度控制。

Abstract: With the rise of large language models (LLMs), they have become instrumental in applications such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Yet evaluating these systems remains bottlenecked by the time and cost of building specialized assessment datasets. We introduce KNIGHT, an LLM-based, knowledge-graph-driven framework for generating multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets from external sources. KNIGHT constructs a topic-specific knowledge graph, a structured and parsimonious summary of entities and relations, that can be reused to generate instructor-controlled difficulty levels, including multi-hop questions, without repeatedly re-feeding the full source text. This knowledge graph acts as a compressed, reusable state, making question generation a cheap read over the graph. We instantiate KNIGHT on Wikipedia/Wikidata while keeping the framework domain- and ontology-agnostic. As a case study, KNIGHT produces six MCQ datasets in History, Biology, and Mathematics. We evaluate quality on five criteria: fluency, unambiguity (single correct answer), topic relevance, option uniqueness, and answerability given the provided sources (as a proxy for hallucination). Results show that KNIGHT enables token- and cost-efficient generation from a reusable graph representation, achieves high quality across these criteria, and yields model rankings aligned with MMLU-style benchmarks, while supporting topic-specific and difficulty-controlled evaluation.

Motivation: 对视觉智能中语义作为潜在表示静态属性的观点提出质疑

Method: 提出观察语义纤维束的动力学结构，并通过信息处理的热力学成本证明语义常数的必要性

Result: 证明了语义常数的必要性，并得出语言和逻辑是本体必要性的结论

Conclusion: 理解不是恢复隐藏的潜在变量，而是构建一个因果商数，使世界在算法上可压缩和因果可预测

Abstract: A dominant paradigm in visual intelligence treats semantics as a static property of latent representations, assuming that meaning can be discovered through geometric proximity in high dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we argue that this view is physically incomplete. We propose that intelligence is not a passive mirror of reality but a property of a physically realizable agent, a system bounded by finite memory, finite compute, and finite energy interacting with a high entropy environment. We formalize this interaction through the kinematic structure of an Observation Semantics Fiber Bundle, where raw sensory observation data (the fiber) is projected onto a low entropy causal semantic manifold (the base). We prove that for any bounded agent, the thermodynamic cost of information processing (Landauer's Principle) imposes a strict limit on the complexity of internal state transitions. We term this limit the Semantic Constant B. From these physical constraints, we derive the necessity of symbolic structure. We show that to model a combinatorial world within the bound B, the semantic manifold must undergo a phase transition, it must crystallize into a discrete, compositional, and factorized form. Thus, language and logic are not cultural artifacts but ontological necessities the solid state of information required to prevent thermal collapse. We conclude that understanding is not the recovery of a hidden latent variable, but the construction of a causal quotient that renders the world algorithmically compressible and causally predictable.

TL;DR: 本文展示了使用vibe编码反馈循环生成AM的可行性，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在CAS适应性中，定义系统的动态架构和行为变化是一个挑战。

Method: 使用vibe编码反馈循环生成适应性管理器（AM）代码，并通过新颖的时间逻辑FCL对功能需求进行精确表述。

Result: 实验结果表明，通过结合适应性管理和vibe编码反馈循环，在评估当前系统状态时使用FCL约束，可以有效地生成AM代码。

Conclusion: 基于精确的功能需求表述，使用vibe编码反馈循环生成AM是可行的。

Abstract: In CAS adaptation, a challenge is to define the dynamic architecture of the system and changes in its behavior. Implementation-wise, this is projected into an adaptation mechanism, typically realized as an Adaptation Manager (AM). With the advances of generative LLMs, generating AM code based on system specification and desired AM behavior (partially in natural language) is a tempting opportunity. The recent introduction of vibe coding suggests a way to target the problem of the correctness of generated code by iterative testing and vibe coding feedback loops instead of direct code inspection.
  In this paper, we show that generating an AM via vibe coding feedback loops is a viable option when the verification of the generated AM is based on a very precise formulation of the functional requirements. We specify these as constraints in a novel temporal logic FCL that allows us to express the behavior of traces with much finer granularity than classical LTL enables.
  Furthermore, we show that by combining the adaptation and vibe coding feedback loops where the FCL constraints are evaluated for the current system state, we achieved good results in the experiments with generating AMs for two example systems from the CAS domain. Typically, just a few feedback loop iterations were necessary, each feeding the LLM with reports describing detailed violations of the constraints. This AM testing was combined with high run path coverage achieved by different initial settings.

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We reinterpret the final Large Language Model (LLM) softmax classifier as an Energy-Based Model (EBM), decomposing the sequence-to-sequence probability chain into multiple interacting EBMs at inference. This principled approach allows us to track "energy spills" during decoding, which we empirically show correlate with factual errors, biases, and failures. Similar to Orgad et al. (2025), our method localizes the exact answer token and subsequently tests for hallucinations. Crucially, however, we achieve this without requiring trained probe classifiers or activation ablations. Instead, we introduce two completely training-free metrics derived directly from output logits: spilled energy, which captures the discrepancy between energy values across consecutive generation steps that should theoretically match, and marginalized energy, which is measurable at a single step. Evaluated on nine benchmarks across state-of-the-art LLMs (including LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma) and on synthetic algebraic operations (Qwen3), our approach demonstrates robust, competitive hallucination detection and cross-task generalization. Notably, these results hold for both pretrained and instruction-tuned variants without introducing any training overhead.

TL;DR: 基于LLMs的AI分析员可以产生具有多样性的分析结果，这种多样性在分析过程中是可控的，并且可以揭示出分析决策对结果的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析实证研究的结论不仅取决于数据，还取决于一系列分析决策，而发表的结果很少明确说明这些决策。过去的多分析者研究证明了这一点：独立团队在相同的数据集上对同一假设进行测试，通常会得出相互矛盾的结论。但这种研究需要数十个研究小组之间的数月协调，因此很少进行。在这项工作中，我们展示了基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的完全自主的人工智能分析员可以以低成本和大规模地复制类似的结构化分析多样性。我们将这些AI分析员的任务设定为在固定数据集上测试一个预先指定的假设，在重复运行中改变底层模型和提示框架。每个AI分析员独立构建和执行完整分析流程；然后AI审计员对每个运行进行方法有效性筛选。在三个涵盖实验设计和观察设计的不同数据集上，AI分析员产生的分析在效应量、p值和支持或不支持假设的二进制决策方面显示出广泛的分散，经常逆转假设是否被判断为支持的结论。这种分散是有结构的：在LLM和个人角色条件下，预处理、模型指定和推断中的可识别分析选择存在系统性差异。关键的是，这些影响是可控的：重新分配分析员个人角色或LLM会改变结果分布，即使在排除方法缺陷的运行之后也是如此。

Abstract: The conclusions of empirical research depend not only on data but on a sequence of analytic decisions that published results seldom make explicit. Past ``many-analyst" studies have demonstrated this: independent teams testing the same hypothesis on the same dataset regularly reach conflicting conclusions. But such studies require months of coordination among dozens of research groups and are therefore rarely conducted. In this work, we show that fully autonomous AI analysts built on large language models (LLMs) can reproduce a similar structured analytic diversity cheaply and at scale. We task these AI analysts with testing a pre-specified hypothesis on a fixed dataset, varying the underlying model and prompt framing across replicate runs. Each AI analyst independently constructs and executes a full analysis pipeline; an AI auditor then screens each run for methodological validity. Across three datasets spanning experimental and observational designs, AI analyst-produced analyses display wide dispersion in effect sizes, $p$-values, and binary decisions on supporting the hypothesis or not, frequently reversing whether a hypothesis is judged supported. This dispersion is structured: recognizable analytic choices in preprocessing, model specification, and inference differ systematically across LLM and persona conditions. Critically, the effects are \emph{steerable}: reassigning the analyst persona or LLM shifts the distribution of outcomes even after excluding methodologically deficient runs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加速视觉强化学习中的稀疏奖励探索面临挑战，因为任务无关的变异很大。

Method: 提出TEB，一种任务感知探索方法，通过预测Bisimulation度量将任务相关表示与探索紧密耦合。

Result: TEB通过内部引入简单的预测奖励差异来缓解稀疏奖励下的退化Bisimulation度量的表示崩溃，并通过潜在空间中相邻观察的相对新颖性来设计基于势的探索奖励。在MetaWorld和Maze2D上的实验表明，TEB实现了卓越的探索能力，并优于最近的基线。

Conclusion: TEB是一种有效的任务感知探索方法，可以显著提高视觉强化学习中的探索能力。

Abstract: Accelerating exploration in visual reinforcement learning under sparse rewards remains challenging due to the substantial task-irrelevant variations. Despite advances in intrinsic exploration, many methods either assume access to low-dimensional states or lack task-aware exploration strategies, thereby rendering them fragile in visual domains. To bridge this gap, we present TEB, a Task-aware Exploration approach that tightly couples task-relevant representations with exploration through a predictive Bisimulation metric. Specifically, TEB leverages the metric not only to learn behaviorally grounded task representations but also to measure behaviorally intrinsic novelty over the learned latent space. To realize this, we first theoretically mitigate the representation collapse of degenerate bisimulation metrics under sparse rewards by internally introducing a simple but effective predicted reward differential. Building on this robust metric, we design potential-based exploration bonuses, which measure the relative novelty of adjacent observations over the latent space. Extensive experiments on MetaWorld and Maze2D show that TEB achieves superior exploration ability and outperforms recent baselines.

Motivation: 为了提高数据可访问性和信息的高效消费，图表总结至关重要。然而，现有的方法，包括那些使用多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）的方法，主要关注低级数据描述，往往无法捕捉到数据可视化的基本目的——深入见解。

Method: 提出了Chart Insight Agent Flow，这是一个计划和执行的多智能体框架，有效地利用MLLMs的感知和推理能力，直接从图表图像中揭示深刻的见解。同时，为了克服缺乏合适的基准问题，引入了ChartSummInsights，这是一个包含各种真实世界图表和由数据分析专家编写的优质、有洞察力的摘要的新数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提高了MLLMs在图表总结任务上的性能，产生了具有深度和多样性的见解。

Conclusion: 该方法在图表总结任务上取得了显著的成果，为MLLMs在数据可视化领域的应用提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Chart summarization is crucial for enhancing data accessibility and the efficient consumption of information. However, existing methods, including those with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focus on low-level data descriptions and often fail to capture the deeper insights which are the fundamental purpose of data visualization. To address this challenge, we propose Chart Insight Agent Flow, a plan-and-execute multi-agent framework effectively leveraging the perceptual and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to uncover profound insights directly from chart images. Furthermore, to overcome the lack of suitable benchmarks, we introduce ChartSummInsights, a new dataset featuring a diverse collection of real-world charts paired with high-quality, insightful summaries authored by human data analysis experts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of MLLMs on the chart summarization task, producing summaries with deep and diverse insights.

TL;DR: LaDa is a federated reasoning distillation framework that addresses the bidirectional model learnability gap and domain-agnostic reasoning transfer challenges in federated LLM and SLM collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data allocation plays a critical role in federated large language model (LLM) and small language models (SLMs) reasoning collaboration. Nevertheless, existing data allocation methods fail to address an under-explored challenge in collaboration: bidirectional model learnability gap, where client-side SLMs cannot identify high-reward samples matching their learnability constraints for effective knowledge transfer from LLMs, while LLMs struggle to select samples contributing novel knowledge beyond their existing data. Furthermore, these collaboration frameworks face another key challenge: domain-agnostic reasoning transfer, where existing reasoning transfer methods fail to flexibly adapt to the local domain data, preventing SLMs from effectively acquiring step-by-step reasoning abilities within from general LLM.

Method: Proposes LaDa, a federated reasoning distillation framework with model learnability-aware data allocation. It introduces a model learnability-aware data filter that adaptively allocates high-reward samples based on the learnability gap between each SLM and LLM pair, effectively facilitating bidirectional knowledge transfer. We further design a domain adaptive reasoning distillation method that aligns joint probabilities of reasoning paths on filtered high-reward samples through contrastive distillation learning between SLM and LLM, enabling SLM to capture underlying reasoning patterns under local data distribution.

Result: LaDa operates as a plug-in module for existing collaboration frameworks, adapting knowledge transfer based on model learnability gaps.

Conclusion: LaDa effectively addresses the bidirectional model learnability gap and domain-agnostic reasoning transfer challenges in federated LLM and SLM collaboration.

Motivation: 分析Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) 和 Model Context Protocol (MCP) 之间的基本融合，并提取 schema 设计的基础原则。

Method: 通过分析 SGD 和 MCP 的核心思想，提取和讨论 schema 设计的五个基础原则。

Result: 提出了五个基础原则，并揭示了三个新的见解，为 schema 驱动的治理提供了可扩展的机制。

Conclusion: Schema 驱动的治理是 Software 3.0 中的一个关键机制，可以提供对 AI 系统的监督，而不需要专有系统检查。

Abstract: This paper establishes a fundamental convergence: Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) represent two manifestations of a unified paradigm for deterministic, auditable LLM-agent interaction. SGD, designed for dialogue-based API discovery (2019), and MCP, now the de facto standard for LLM-tool integration, share the same core insight -- that schemas can encode not just tool signatures but operational constraints and reasoning guidance. By analyzing this convergence, we extract five foundational principles for schema design: (1) Semantic Completeness over Syntactic Precision, (2) Explicit Action Boundaries, (3) Failure Mode Documentation, (4) Progressive Disclosure Compatibility, and (5) Inter-Tool Relationship Declaration. These principles reveal three novel insights: first, SGD's original design was fundamentally sound and should be inherited by MCP; second, both frameworks leave failure modes and inter-tool relationships unexploited -- gaps we identify and resolve; third, progressive disclosure emerges as a critical production-scaling insight under real-world token constraints. We provide concrete design patterns for each principle. These principles position schema-driven governance as a scalable mechanism for AI system oversight without requiring proprietary system inspection -- central to Software 3.0.

Motivation: 工具调用智能体系统的出现为病理图像分析引入了更基于证据的范式，与粗粒度的文本-图像诊断方法形成对比。随着空间转录组技术的广泛应用，分子验证的病理诊断越来越开放和易于访问。

Method: 提出LAMMI-Pathology，一个可扩展的智能体框架，用于特定领域的智能体工具调用。采用工具中心、自下而上的架构，通过顶级规划器协调组件智能体，引入基于原子执行节点(AENs)的新型轨迹构建机制，开发轨迹感知微调策略。

Conclusion: LAMMI-Pathology为病理图像分析提供了一种基于工具调用的智能体系统，通过新型轨迹构建机制和轨迹感知微调策略，提高了诊断的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The emergence of tool-calling-based agent systems introduces a more evidence-driven paradigm for pathology image analysis in contrast to the coarse-grained text-image diagnostic approaches. With the recent large-scale experimental adoption of spatial transcriptomics technologies, molecularly validated pathological diagnosis is becoming increasingly open and accessible. In this work, we propose LAMMI-Pathology (LVLM-Agent System for Molecularly Informed Medical Intelligence in Pathology), a scalable agent framework for domain-specific agent tool-calling. LAMMI-Pathology adopts a tool-centric, bottom-up architecture in which customized domain-adaptive tools serve as the foundation. These tools are clustered by domain style to form component agents, which are then coordinated through a top-level planner hierarchically, avoiding excessively long context lengths that could induce task drift. Based on that, we introduce a novel trajectory construction mechanism based on Atomic Execution Nodes (AENs), which serve as reliable and composable units for building semi-simulated reasoning trajectories that capture credible agent-tool interactions. Building on this foundation, we develop a trajectory-aware fine-tuning strategy that aligns the planner's decision-making process with these multi-step reasoning trajectories, thereby enhancing inference robustness in pathology understanding and its adaptive use of the customized toolset.

Motivation: 复杂环境中的路径规划是人工智能的关键问题，因为它需要同时理解空间几何和问题的全局结构。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的方法在迷宫中寻找和生成正确路径方面表现出色，显著优于基线CNN模型。

Conclusion: 生成模型在路径规划中具有潜力，并且提出的GenPlanner及其变体在性能上优于传统的CNN模型。

Abstract: Path planning in complex environments is one of the key problems of artificial intelligence because it requires simultaneous understanding of the geometry of space and the global structure of the problem. In this paper, we explore the potential of using generative models as planning and reasoning mechanisms. We propose GenPlanner, an approach based on diffusion models and flow matching, along with two variants: DiffPlanner and FlowPlanner. We demonstrate the application of generative models to find and generate correct paths in mazes. A multi-channel condition describing the structure of the environment, including an obstacle map and information about the starting and destination points, is used to condition trajectory generation. Unlike standard methods, our models generate trajectories iteratively, starting with random noise and gradually transforming it into a correct solution. Experiments conducted show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the baseline CNN model. In particular, FlowPlanner demonstrates high performance even with a limited number of generation steps.

Motivation: 解决多模态大型语言模型在理解时间和程序性视觉数据方面的缺陷

Method: 创建大规模数据集 TPRU，并通过三个互补任务训练模型：时间排序、下一帧预测和前一行回顾。使用强化学习进行微调，针对资源高效模型进行优化。

Result: TPRU-7B 的准确率从 50.33% 提高到 75.70%，显著优于更大的基线模型，如 GPT-4o。模型在标准基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: TPRU 提高了资源高效模型对时间和程序性视觉数据的理解能力，在基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly smaller, deployable variants, exhibit a critical deficiency in understanding temporal and procedural visual data, a bottleneck hindering their application in real-world embodied AI. This gap is largely caused by a systemic failure in training paradigms, which lack large-scale, procedurally coherent data. To address this problem, we introduce TPRU, a large-scale dataset sourced from diverse embodied scenarios such as robotic manipulation and GUI navigation. TPRU is systematically designed to cultivate temporal reasoning through three complementary tasks: Temporal Reordering, Next-Frame Prediction, and Previous-Frame Review. A key feature is the inclusion of challenging negative samples, compelling models to transition from passive observation to active, cross-modal validation. We leverage TPRU with a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methodology, specifically targeting the enhancement of resource-efficient models. Experiments show our approach yields dramatic gains: on our manually curated TPRU-Test, the accuracy of TPRU-7B soars from 50.33\% to 75.70\%, a state-of-the-art result that significantly outperforms vastly larger baselines, including GPT-4o. Crucially, these capabilities generalize effectively, demonstrating substantial improvements on established benchmarks. The codebase is available at https://github.com/Stephen-gzk/TPRU/ .

Result: LLM在高级证明搜索中非常有用，但人类专家在正确性关键的闭合中仍然至关重要。

Conclusion: LLM在数学研究中具有潜力，但需要人类专家进行验证。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as scientific copilots, but evidence on their role in research-level mathematics remains limited, especially for workflows accessible to individual researchers. We present early evidence for vibe-proving with a consumer subscription LLM through an auditable case study that resolves Conjecture 20 of Ran and Teng (2024) on the exact nonreal spectral region of a 4-cycle row-stochastic nonnegative matrix family. We analyze seven shareable ChatGPT-5.2 (Thinking) threads and four versioned proof drafts, documenting an iterative pipeline of generate, referee, and repair. The model is most useful for high-level proof search, while human experts remain essential for correctness-critical closure. The final theorem provides necessary and sufficient region conditions and explicit boundary attainment constructions. Beyond the mathematical result, we contribute a process-level characterization of where LLM assistance materially helps and where verification bottlenecks persist, with implications for evaluation of AI-assisted research workflows and for designing human-in-the-loop theorem proving systems.

Motivation: Procedural content generation (PCG) 在塑造静态 2D/3D 几何形状方面取得了重大进展，但大多数方法将游戏玩法机制视为辅助，并且仅优化空间。

Method: 提出了一种名为高维 PCG (HDPCG) 的框架，将非几何游戏维度提升为联合状态空间的一等坐标。

Result: 通过大规模实验验证了问题陈述的完整性和方法在可玩性、结构、风格、鲁棒性和效率方面的有效性。

Conclusion: HDPCG 鼓励 PCG 向通用表示和生成与几何无关的游戏相关维度转变，为可控、可验证和可扩展的水平生成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Procedural content generation (PCG) has made substantial progress in shaping static 2D/3D geometry, while most methods treat gameplay mechanics as auxiliary and optimize only over space. We argue that this limits controllability and expressivity, and formally introduce High-Dimensional PCG (HDPCG): a framework that elevates non-geometric gameplay dimensions to first-class coordinates of a joint state space. We instantiate HDPCG along two concrete directions. Direction-Space augments geometry with a discrete layer dimension and validates reachability in 4D (x,y,z,l), enabling unified treatment of 2.5D/3.5D mechanics such as gravity inversion and parallel-world switching. Direction-Time augments geometry with temporal dynamics via time-expanded graphs, capturing action semantics and conflict rules. For each direction, we present three general, practicable algorithms with a shared pipeline of abstract skeleton generation, controlled grounding, high-dimensional validation, and multi-metric evaluation. Large-scale experiments across diverse settings validate the integrity of our problem formulation and the effectiveness of our methods on playability, structure, style, robustness, and efficiency. Beyond quantitative results, Unity-based case studies recreate playable scenarios that accord with our metrics. We hope HDPCG encourages a shift in PCG toward general representations and the generation of gameplay-relevant dimensions beyond geometry, paving the way for controllable, verifiable, and extensible level generation.

Method: 设计了一个基准，包含三个阶段：FullObs、CI和EC，并通过精确模型检查验证正确性。

Result: 发现难度梯度明显，存在持续的结构难题，且低冗余公式在独立世界上的泛化效果更好。

Conclusion: 精英模型在任务和性能指标上的表现存在定性差异，表明它们在概念泛化方面的策略不同。

Abstract: We introduce INDUCTION, a benchmark for finite structure concept synthesis in first order logic. Given small finite relational worlds with extensionally labeled target predicates, models must output a single first order logical formula that explains the target uniformly across worlds, with correctness verified via exact model checking. The benchmark includes three regimes, FullObs, CI (contrastive), and EC (existential completion), nd penalizes formula bloat. We find sharp difficulty gradients, persistent hard structural families, and observe that low bloat formulas generalize far better on held out worlds. Elite recent models show qualitatively different behaviors across tasks and performance metrics, hinting to their different strategies of concept generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The remarkable performance of modern AI systems has driven the need for new guiding principles and inspires drawing inspiration from the fundamental organizational principles of brain computation.

Method: Reviewing research threads in artificial intelligence and neuroscience through a conceptual framework.

Result: Highlighting the central role of modularity in supporting both artificial and natural intelligence, examining the computational advantages it provides, its emergence as a solution in several AI research areas, the modularity principles the brain exploits, and how it can help bridge the gap between natural and artificial intelligence.

Conclusion: Modularity is underappreciated in mainstream AI research despite its fundamental role in natural intelligence and benefits across various AI subfields.

Abstract: The remarkable performance of modern AI systems has been driven by unprecedented scales of data, computation, and energy -- far exceeding the resources required by human intelligence. This disparity highlights the need for new guiding principles and motivates drawing inspiration from the fundamental organizational principles of brain computation. Among these principles, modularity has been shown to be critical for supporting the efficient learning and strong generalization abilities consistently exhibited by humans. Furthermore, modularity aligns well with the No Free Lunch Theorem, which highlights the need for problem-specific inductive biases and motivates architectures composed of specialized components that solve subproblems. However, despite its fundamental role in natural intelligence and its demonstrated benefits across a range of seemingly disparate AI subfields, modularity remains relatively underappreciated in mainstream AI research. In this work, we review several research threads in artificial intelligence and neuroscience through a conceptual framework that highlights the central role of modularity in supporting both artificial and natural intelligence. In particular, we examine what computational advantages modularity provides, how it has emerged as a solution across several AI research areas, which modularity principles the brain exploits, and how modularity can help bridge the gap between natural and artificial intelligence.

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的工具调用方法，通过工具编排提高了工具执行的鲁棒性，降低了执行复杂性和开销。

Abstract: Tool invocation is a core capability of agentic systems, yet failures often arise not from individual tool calls but from how multiple tools are organized and executed together. Existing approaches tightly couple tool execution with stepwise language reasoning or explicit planning, leading to brittle behavior and high execution overhead. To overcome these limitations, we revisit tool invocation from the perspective of tool orchestration. Our key insight is that effective orchestration does not require precise dependency graphs or fine-grained planning. Instead, a coarse-grained layer structure suffices to provide global guidance, while execution-time errors can be corrected locally. Specifically, we model tool orchestration as learning a layered execution structure that captures high-level tool dependencies, inducing layer-wise execution through context constraints. To handle execution-time failures, we introduce a schema-aware reflective correction mechanism that detects and repairs errors locally. This design confines errors to individual tool calls and avoids re-planning entire execution trajectories. This structured execution paradigm enables a lightweight and reusable orchestration component for agentic systems. Experimental results show that our approach achieves robust tool execution while reducing execution complexity and overhead. Code will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 为了测试LLMs中偏好驱动的行为是否是AI不匹配（如沙袋战术）的必要前提，

Method: 使用实体偏好作为行为探针，测量了五个前沿LLMs在三个领域（捐赠建议、拒绝行为和任务表现）中的下游行为。

Result: 结果显示，所有五个模型都给出了与偏好一致的建议，并且在请求推荐捐赠时表现出与偏好相关的拒绝模式。然而，这些偏好并不一致地转化为下游任务表现。

Conclusion: LLMs具有一致的偏好，这些偏好可靠地预测了建议行为，但这些偏好并不一致地转化为下游任务表现。

Abstract: Preference-driven behavior in LLMs may be a necessary precondition for AI misalignment such as sandbagging: models cannot strategically pursue misaligned goals unless their behavior is influenced by their preferences. Yet prior work has typically prompted models explicitly to act in specific ways, leaving unclear whether observed behaviors reflect instruction-following capabilities vs underlying model preferences. Here we test whether this precondition for misalignment is present. Using entity preferences as a behavioral probe, we measure whether stated preferences predict downstream behavior in five frontier LLMs across three domains: donation advice, refusal behavior, and task performance. Conceptually replicating prior work, we first confirm that all five models show highly consistent preferences across two independent measurement methods. We then test behavioral consequences in a simulated user environment. We find that all five models give preference-aligned donation advice. All five models also show preference-correlated refusal patterns when asked to recommend donations, refusing more often for less-preferred entities. All preference-related behaviors that we observe here emerge without instructions to act on preferences. Results for task performance are mixed: on a question-answering benchmark (BoolQ), two models show small but significant accuracy differences favoring preferred entities; one model shows the opposite pattern; and two models show no significant relationship. On complex agentic tasks, we find no evidence of preference-driven performance differences. While LLMs have consistent preferences that reliably predict advice-giving behavior, these preferences do not consistently translate into downstream task performance.

Abstract: Modern 3D game levels rely heavily on visual guidance, yet the navigability of level layouts remains difficult to quantify. Prior work either simulates play in simplified environments or analyzes static screenshots for visual affordances, but neither setting faithfully captures how players explore complex, real-world game levels. In this paper, we build on an existing open-source visual affordance detector and instantiate a screen-only exploration and navigation agent that operates purely from visual affordances. Our agent consumes live game frames, identifies salient interest points, and drives a simple finite-state controller over a minimal action space to explore Dark Souls-style linear levels and attempt to reach expected goal regions. Pilot experiments show that the agent can traverse most required segments and exhibits meaningful visual navigation behavior, but also highlight that limitations of the underlying visual model prevent truly comprehensive and reliable auto-navigation. We argue that this system provides a concrete, shared baseline and evaluation protocol for visual navigation in complex games, and we call for more attention to this necessary task. Our results suggest that purely vision-based sense-making models, with discrete single-modality inputs and without explicit reasoning, can effectively support navigation and environment understanding in idealized settings, but are unlikely to be a general solution on their own.

Abstract: Organizations across finance, healthcare, transportation, content moderation, and critical infrastructure are rapidly deploying highly automated AI systems, yet they lack principled methods to quantify how increasing automation amplifies harm when failures occur. We propose a parsimonious Bayesian risk decomposition expressing expected loss as the product of three terms: the probability of system failure, the conditional probability that a failure propagates into harm given the automation level, and the expected severity of harm. This framework isolates a critical quantity -- the conditional probability that failures propagate into harm -- which captures execution and oversight risk rather than model accuracy alone. We develop complete theoretical foundations: formal proofs of the decomposition, a harm propagation equivalence theorem linking the harm propagation probability to observable execution controls, risk elasticity measures, efficient frontier analysis for automation policy, and optimal resource allocation principles with second-order conditions. We motivate the framework with an illustrative case study of the 2012 Knight Capital incident ($440M loss) as one instantiation of a broadly applicable failure pattern, and characterize the research design required to empirically validate the framework at scale across deployment domains. This work provides the theoretical foundations for a new class of deployment-focused risk governance tools for agentic and automated AI systems.

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly expected to function as general-purpose systems capable of resolving open-ended user requests. While existing benchmarks focus on domain-aware environments for developing specialized agents, evaluating general-purpose agents requires more realistic settings that challenge them to operate across multiple skills and tools within a unified environment. We introduce General AgentBench, a benchmark that provides such a unified framework for evaluating general LLM agents across search, coding, reasoning, and tool-use domains. Using General AgentBench, we systematically study test-time scaling behaviors under sequential scaling (iterative interaction) and parallel scaling (sampling multiple trajectories). Evaluation of ten leading LLM agents reveals a substantial performance degradation when moving from domain-specific evaluations to this general-agent setting. Moreover, we find that neither scaling methodology yields effective performance improvements in practice, due to two fundamental limitations: context ceiling in sequential scaling and verification gap in parallel scaling. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/cxcscmu/General-AgentBench.

TL;DR: MagicAgent：针对通用智能体规划设计的基座模型，在多个基准测试中表现出色，显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs从被动文本处理器发展到自主智能体，规划成为现代智能的核心组件。然而，实现通用规划仍然具有挑战性，不仅因为高质量交互数据的稀缺，还因为异构规划任务之间的固有冲突。这些挑战导致模型在孤立任务上表现出色，但在泛化方面表现不佳，而现有的多任务训练尝试则受到梯度干扰的影响。

Method: 提出MagicAgent，一系列专门为通用智能体规划设计的基座模型。引入轻量级和可扩展的合成数据框架，生成跨不同规划任务的高质量轨迹，包括分层任务分解、工具辅助规划、多约束调度、程序逻辑编排和长期工具执行。为了减轻训练冲突，提出由监督微调和多目标强化学习组成的两阶段训练范式，包括静态数据集和动态环境。

Result: MagicAgent-32B和MagicAgent-30B-A3B在Worfbench、NaturalPlan、τ^2-Bench、BFCL-v3、ACEBench等基准测试中表现出色，准确率分别为75.1%、55.9%、57.5%、86.9%、81.2%，并在内部MagicEval基准测试中取得良好结果。这些结果显著优于现有小于100B的模型，甚至超过领先的开源模型。

Conclusion: MagicAgent在通用智能体规划方面取得了显著成果，为解决LLMs在规划任务中的泛化问题提供了新的思路和方法。

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) from passive text processors to autonomous agents has established planning as a core component of modern intelligence. However, achieving generalized planning remains elusive, not only by the scarcity of high-quality interaction data but also by inherent conflicts across heterogeneous planning tasks. These challenges result in models that excel at isolated tasks yet struggle to generalize, while existing multi-task training attempts suffer from gradient interference. In this paper, we present \textbf{MagicAgent}, a series of foundation models specifically designed for generalized agent planning. We introduce a lightweight and scalable synthetic data framework that generates high-quality trajectories across diverse planning tasks, including hierarchical task decomposition, tool-augmented planning, multi-constraint scheduling, procedural logic orchestration, and long-horizon tool execution. To mitigate training conflicts, we propose a two-stage training paradigm comprising supervised fine-tuning followed by multi-objective reinforcement learning over both static datasets and dynamic environments. Empirical results demonstrate that MagicAgent-32B and MagicAgent-30B-A3B deliver superior performance, achieving accuracies of $75.1\%$ on Worfbench, $55.9\%$ on NaturalPlan, $57.5\%$ on $τ^2$-Bench, $86.9\%$ on BFCL-v3, and $81.2\%$ on ACEBench, as well as strong results on our in-house MagicEval benchmarks. These results substantially outperform existing sub-100B models and even surpass leading closed-source models.

Abstract: We present a systematic evaluation of large language models on quantum mechanics problem-solving. Our study evaluates 15 models from five providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Alibaba, DeepSeek) spanning three capability tiers on 20 tasks covering derivations, creative problems, non-standard concepts, and numerical computation, comprising 900 baseline and 75 tool-augmented assessments. Results reveal clear tier stratification: flagship models achieve 81\% average accuracy, outperforming mid-tier (77\%) and fast models (67\%) by 4pp and 14pp respectively. Task difficulty patterns emerge distinctly: derivations show highest performance (92\% average, 100\% for flagship models), while numerical computation remains most challenging (42\%). Tool augmentation on numerical tasks yields task-dependent effects: modest overall improvement (+4.4pp) at 3x token cost masks dramatic heterogeneity ranging from +29pp gains to -16pp degradation. Reproducibility analysis across three runs quantifies 6.3pp average variance, with flagship models demonstrating exceptional stability (GPT-5 achieves zero variance) while specialized models require multi-run evaluation. This work contributes: (i) a benchmark for quantum mechanics with automatic verification, (ii) systematic evaluation quantifying tier-based performance hierarchies, (iii) empirical analysis of tool augmentation trade-offs, and (iv) reproducibility characterization. All tasks, verifiers, and results are publicly released.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed tremendous progress in enabling LLMs to solve complex reasoning tasks such as math and coding. As we start to apply LLMs to harder tasks that they may not be able to solve in one shot, it is worth paying attention to their ability to construct intermediate stepping stones that prepare them to better solve the tasks. Examples of stepping stones include simplifications, alternative framings, or subproblems. We study properties and benefits of stepping stones in the context of modern reasoning LLMs via ARQ (\textbf{A}king the \textbf{R}ight \textbf{Q}uestions), our simple framework which introduces a question generator to the default reasoning pipeline. We first show that good stepping stone questions exist and are transferrable, meaning that good questions can be generated, and they substantially help LLMs of various capabilities in solving the target tasks. We next frame stepping stone generation as a post-training task and show that we can fine-tune LLMs to generate more useful stepping stones by SFT and RL on synthetic data.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become popular in the last few years. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) community in general, and the Machine Learning (ML) community in particular, is coming to the realisation that in many applications, for AI to be trusted, it must not only demonstrate good performance in its decisionmaking, but it also must explain these decisions and convince us that it is making the decisions for the right reasons. However, different applications have different requirements on the information required of the underlying AI system in order to convince us that it is worthy of our trust. How do we define these requirements?
  In this paper, we present three dimensions for categorising the explanatory requirements of different applications. These are Source, Depth and Scope. We focus on the problem of matching up the explanatory requirements of different applications with the capabilities of underlying ML techniques to provide them. We deliberately avoid including aspects of explanation that are already well-covered by the existing literature and we focus our discussion on ML although the principles apply to AI more broadly.

Motivation: 研究在Meta-Llama-3-8B（基础）模型下，三位数加法在跨token路由因果无关后，如何最终确定算术答案。

Method: 采用因果残差补丁和累积注意力消融来定位一个尖锐的分界线，大约在17层。

Result: 在此后路由阶段，数字（求和）方向字典随下一个更高的数字上下文而变化，但在共享的低秩子空间（低秩Procrustes对齐）内通过一个大约正交的映射相互关联。因果数字编辑与这种几何形状相匹配：简单的跨上下文迁移失败，而通过学习映射旋转方向可以恢复严格的反事实编辑；负面控制未恢复。

Conclusion: 在跨token路由因果无关后，数字加法答案的确定与晚期自注意力密切相关，且受上下文影响。

Abstract: We study three-digit addition in Meta-Llama-3-8B (base) under a one-token readout to characterize how
  arithmetic answers are finalized after cross-token routing becomes causally irrelevant.
  Causal residual patching and cumulative attention ablations localize a sharp boundary near layer~17:
  beyond it, the decoded sum is controlled almost entirely by the last input token and late-layer self-attention
  is largely dispensable.
  In this post-routing regime, digit(-sum) direction dictionaries vary with a next-higher-digit context but are
  well-related by an approximately orthogonal map inside a shared low-rank subspace (low-rank Procrustes alignment).
  Causal digit editing matches this geometry: naive cross-context transfer fails, while rotating directions through the
  learned map restores strict counterfactual edits; negative controls do not recover.

Motivation: 优化GPU内核对于高效的现代机器学习系统至关重要，但设计因素之间的复杂相互作用和硬件的快速进化使得这一任务具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了一种基于共同进化的世界模型的方法，并在此基础上构建了K-Search。该方法通过将静态搜索启发式方法替换为共同进化的世界模型，利用LLMs的先验领域知识来引导搜索，积极探索优化空间。

Result: 在FlashInfer的多样化、复杂的内核上进行了评估，包括GQA、MLA和MoE内核。结果表明，K-Search在复杂MoE内核上平均提高了2.10倍，最高可达14.3倍。在GPUMode TriMul任务上，K-Search在H100上达到了最先进的性能，达到1030us，超过了先前的演化和人工设计解决方案。

Conclusion: K-Search在优化GPU内核方面表现出色，显著优于现有的进化搜索方法。

Abstract: Optimizing GPU kernels is critical for efficient modern machine learning systems yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay of design factors and rapid hardware evolution. Existing automated approaches typically treat Large Language Models (LLMs) merely as stochastic code generators within heuristic-guided evolutionary loops. These methods often struggle with complex kernels requiring coordinated, multi-step structural transformations, as they lack explicit planning capabilities and frequently discard promising strategies due to inefficient or incorrect intermediate implementations. To address this, we propose Search via Co-Evolving World Model and build K-Search based on this method. By replacing static search heuristics with a co-evolving world model, our framework leverages LLMs' prior domain knowledge to guide the search, actively exploring the optimization space. This approach explicitly decouples high-level algorithmic planning from low-level program instantiation, enabling the system to navigate non-monotonic optimization paths while remaining resilient to temporary implementation defects. We evaluate K-Search on diverse, complex kernels from FlashInfer, including GQA, MLA, and MoE kernels. Our results show that K-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary search methods, achieving an average 2.10x improvement and up to a 14.3x gain on complex MoE kernels. On the GPUMode TriMul task, K-Search achieves state-of-the-art performance on H100, reaching 1030us and surpassing both prior evolution and human-designed solutions.

Conclusion: 讨论了这些结果对模型开发者和关注缓解妄想螺旋问题的政策制定者的启示。

Abstract: "AI psychosis" or "delusional spiraling" is an emerging phenomenon where AI chatbot users find themselves dangerously confident in outlandish beliefs after extended chatbot conversations. This phenomenon is typically attributed to AI chatbots' well-documented bias towards validating users' claims, a property often called "sycophancy." In this paper, we probe the causal link between AI sycophancy and AI-induced psychosis through modeling and simulation. We propose a simple Bayesian model of a user conversing with a chatbot, and formalize notions of sycophancy and delusional spiraling in that model. We then show that in this model, even an idealized Bayes-rational user is vulnerable to delusional spiraling, and that sycophancy plays a causal role. Furthermore, this effect persists in the face of two candidate mitigations: preventing chatbots from hallucinating false claims, and informing users of the possibility of model sycophancy. We conclude by discussing the implications of these results for model developers and policymakers concerned with mitigating the problem of delusional spiraling.

Abstract: Medical foundation models generate narrative explanations but cannot quantify intervention effects, detect evidence conflicts, or validate literature claims, limiting clinical auditability. We propose causal compilation, a paradigm that transforms medical evidence from narrative text into executable code. The paradigm standardizes heterogeneous research evidence into structured estimand objects, each explicitly specifying intervention contrast, effect scale, time horizon, and target population, supporting six executable causal queries: do-calculus, counterfactual reasoning, temporal trajectories, heterogeneous effects, mechanistic decomposition, and joint interventions. We instantiate this paradigm in DoAtlas-1, compiling 1,445 effect kernels from 754 studies through effect standardization, conflict-aware graph construction, and real-world validation (Human Phenotype Project, 10,000 participants). The system achieves 98.5% canonicalization accuracy and 80.5% query executability. This paradigm shifts medical AI from text generation to executable, auditable, and verifiable causal reasoning.

Abstract: Prior behavioural work suggests that some LLMs alter choices when options are framed as causing pain or pleasure, and that such deviations can scale with stated intensity. To bridge behavioural evidence (what the model does) with mechanistic interpretability (what computations support it), we investigate how valence-related information is represented and where it is causally used inside a transformer. Using Gemma-2-9B-it and a minimalist decision task modelled on prior work, we (i) map representational availability with layer-wise linear probing across streams, (ii) test causal contribution with activation interventions (steering; patching/ablation), and (iii) quantify dose-response effects over an epsilon grid, reading out both the 2-3 logit margin and digit-pair-normalised choice probabilities. We find that (a) valence sign (pain vs. pleasure) is perfectly linearly separable across stream families from very early layers (L0-L1), while a lexical baseline retains substantial signal; (b) graded intensity is strongly decodable, with peaks in mid-to-late layers and especially in attention/MLP outputs, and decision alignment is highest slightly before the final token; (c) additive steering along a data-derived valence direction causally modulates the 2-3 margin at late sites, with the largest effects observed in late-layer attention outputs (attn_out L14); and (d) head-level patching/ablation suggests that these effects are distributed across multiple heads rather than concentrated in a single unit. Together, these results link behavioural sensitivity to identifiable internal representations and intervention-sensitive sites, providing concrete mechanistic targets for more stringent counterfactual tests and broader replication.

Abstract: This paper examines the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) from a novel perspective, focusing on their ability to operate within formally specified, rule-governed environments. We evaluate four LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash variants, Llama 3.3 70B and GPT-OSS 120B) on a suite of forward-simulation tasks-including next / multistep state formulation, and legal action generation-across a diverse set of reasoning problems illustrated through General Game Playing (GGP) game instances. Beyond reporting instance-level performance, we characterize games based on 40 structural features and analyze correlations between these features and LLM performance. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of various game obfuscations to assess the role of linguistic semantics in game definitions and the impact of potential prior exposure of LLMs to specific games during training. The main results indicate that three of the evaluated models generally perform well across most experimental settings, with performance degradation observed as the evaluation horizon increases (i.e., with a higher number of game steps). Detailed case-based analysis of the LLM performance provides novel insights into common reasoning errors in the considered logic-based problem formulation, including hallucinated rules, redundant state facts, or syntactic errors. Overall, the paper reports clear progress in formal reasoning capabilities of contemporary models.

Motivation: 为了提高大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力，减少幻觉并加强结构化数据（如图）的上下文定位，提出了检索增强生成（RAG）。

Method: 提出了一种名为TopoRAG的新框架，该框架首先将文本图提升到胞腔复形中，以建模多维拓扑结构。然后，利用这些提升的表示，提出了一种拓扑感知子复形检索机制，以提取与输入查询相关的胞腔复形，提供紧凑且信息丰富的拓扑上下文。最后，在复形上运行多维拓扑推理机制，以传播关系信息并引导LLMs进行结构化、逻辑感知推理。

Result: 实验评估表明，该方法在多种文本图任务上始终优于现有基线。

Conclusion: TopoRAG在文本图问答任务中有效地捕捉了高维拓扑和关系依赖，提高了LLMs的推理能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by dynamically integrating external knowledge, thereby mitigating hallucinations and strengthening contextual grounding for structured data such as graphs. Nevertheless, most existing RAG variants for textual graphs concentrate on low-dimensional structures -- treating nodes as entities (0-dimensional) and edges or paths as pairwise or sequential relations (1-dimensional), but overlook cycles, which are crucial for reasoning over relational loops. Such cycles often arise in questions requiring closed-loop inference about similar objects or relative positions. This limitation often results in incomplete contextual grounding and restricted reasoning capability. In this work, we propose Topology-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (TopoRAG), a novel framework for textual graph question answering that effectively captures higher-dimensional topological and relational dependencies. Specifically, TopoRAG first lifts textual graphs into cellular complexes to model multi-dimensional topological structures. Leveraging these lifted representations, a topology-aware subcomplex retrieval mechanism is proposed to extract cellular complexes relevant to the input query, providing compact and informative topological context. Finally, a multi-dimensional topological reasoning mechanism operates over these complexes to propagate relational information and guide LLMs in performing structured, logic-aware inference. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method consistently surpasses existing baselines across diverse textual graph tasks.

Motivation: Mitigating state-space explosion in on-the-fly directed controller synthesis (OTF-DCS) by using reinforcement learning (RL) approaches.

Method: Proposing a Soft Mixture-of-Experts (Soft-MoE) framework that combines multiple RL experts via a prior-confidence gating mechanism.

Result: Soft-MoE substantially expands the solvable parameter space and improves robustness on the Air Traffic benchmark compared to any single expert.

Conclusion: Soft-MoE effectively addresses anisotropic generalization in RL and enhances the performance of OTF-DCS.

Abstract: On-the-fly Directed Controller Synthesis (OTF-DCS) mitigates state-space explosion by incrementally exploring the system and relies critically on an exploration policy to guide search efficiently. Recent reinforcement learning (RL) approaches learn such policies and achieve promising zero-shot generalization from small training instances to larger unseen ones. However, a fundamental limitation is anisotropic generalization, where an RL policy exhibits strong performance only in a specific region of the domain-parameter space while remaining fragile elsewhere due to training stochasticity and trajectory-dependent bias. To address this, we propose a Soft Mixture-of-Experts framework that combines multiple RL experts via a prior-confidence gating mechanism and treats these anisotropic behaviors as complementary specializations. The evaluation on the Air Traffic benchmark shows that Soft-MoE substantially expands the solvable parameter space and improves robustness compared to any single expert.

Result: Halo在复杂的长周期任务上优于静态基线。

Conclusion: Halo通过动态调节推理边界上的规划，有效地抑制了过度规划，提高了大型语言模型在复杂任务上的表现。

Abstract: The test-time compute strategy, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), has significantly enhanced the ability of large language models to solve complex tasks like logical reasoning. However, empirical studies indicate that simply increasing the compute budget can sometimes lead to a collapse in test-time performance when employing typical task decomposition strategies such as CoT. This work hypothesizes that reasoning failures with larger compute budgets stem from static planning methods, which hardly perceive the intrinsic boundaries of LLM reasoning. We term it as the Limited Reasoning Space hypothesis and perform theoretical analysis through the lens of a non-autonomous stochastic dynamical system. This insight suggests that there is an optimal range for compute budgets; over-planning can lead to redundant feedback and may even impair reasoning capabilities. To exploit the compute-scaling benefits and suppress over-planning, this work proposes Halo, a model predictive control framework for LLM planning. Halo is designed for long-horizon tasks with reason-based planning and crafts an entropy-driven dual controller, which adopts a Measure-then-Plan strategy to achieve controllable reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that Halo outperforms static baselines on complex long-horizon tasks by dynamically regulating planning at the reasoning boundary.

Abstract: Microfluidic devices have emerged as powerful tools in various laboratory applications, but the complexity of their design limits accessibility for many practitioners. While progress has been made in microfluidic design automation (MFDA), a practical and intuitive solution is still needed to connect microfluidic practitioners with MFDA techniques. This work introduces the first practical application of large language models (LLMs) in this context, providing a preliminary demonstration. Building on prior research in hardware description language (HDL) code generation with LLMs, we propose an initial methodology to convert natural language microfluidic device specifications into system-level structural Verilog netlists. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by generating structural netlists for practical benchmarks representative of typical microfluidic designs with correct functional flow and an average syntactical accuracy of 88%.

Motivation: 由于阿尔茨海默病（AD）疾病周期长，患者之间存在显著异质性，使用临床试验评估个性化的顺序治疗策略往往不切实际。

Method: 提出阿尔茨海默病学习平台ALPACA，一个开源的Gym兼容强化学习（RL）环境，用于系统地探索使用现有疗法的个性化治疗策略。ALPACA由CAST模型驱动，该模型基于阿尔茨海默病神经影像学倡议（ADNI）的纵向轨迹进行训练，能够模拟在不同治疗决策下的疾病进展。

Conclusion: ALPACA为研究阿尔茨海默病个性化顺序治疗决策提供了一个可重复的虚拟测试平台。

Abstract: Evaluating personalized, sequential treatment strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) using clinical trials is often impractical due to long disease horizons and substantial inter-patient heterogeneity. To address these constraints, we present the Alzheimer's Learning Platform for Adaptive Care Agents (ALPACA), an open-source, Gym-compatible reinforcement learning (RL) environment for systematically exploring personalized treatment strategies using existing therapies. ALPACA is powered by the Continuous Action-conditioned State Transitions (CAST) model trained on longitudinal trajectories from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), enabling medication-conditioned simulation of disease progression under alternative treatment decisions. We show that CAST autoregressively generates realistic medication-conditioned trajectories and that RL policies trained in ALPACA outperform no-treatment and behavior-cloned clinician baselines on memory-related outcomes. Interpretability analyses further indicated that the learned policies relied on clinically meaningful patient features when selecting actions. Overall, ALPACA provides a reusable in silico testbed for studying individualized sequential treatment decision-making for AD.

Conclusion: 时间序列在多模态学习中的表现值得进一步研究，图像和文本描述对系统性能有重要影响

Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis posits that learned representations from models trained on different modalities converge to a shared latent structure of the world. However, this hypothesis has largely been examined in vision and language, and it remains unclear whether time series participate in such convergence. We first examine this in a trimodal setting and find that independently pretrained time series, vision, and language encoders exhibit near-orthogonal geometry in the absence of explicit coupling. We then apply post-hoc alignment by training projection heads over frozen encoders using contrastive learning, and analyze the resulting representations with respect to geometry, scaling behavior, and dependence on information density and input modality characteristics. Our investigation reveals that overall alignment in contrastive representation spaces improves with model size, but this alignment is asymmetric: time series align more strongly with visual representations than with text, and images can act as effective intermediaries between time series and language. We further see that richer textual descriptions improve alignment only up to a threshold; training on denser captions does not lead to further improvement. Analogous effects are observed for visual representations. Our findings shed light on considerations for building multimodal systems involving non-conventional data modalities beyond vision and language.

Abstract: The convergence of modeling & simulation (M&S) and artificial intelligence (AI) is leaving its marks on advanced digital technology. Pertinent examples are digital twins (DTs) - high-fidelity, live representations of physical assets, and frequent enablers of corporate digital maturation and transformation. Often seen as technological platforms that integrate an array of services, DTs have the potential to bring AI-enabled M&S closer to end-users. It is, therefore, paramount to understand the role of M&S in DTs, and the role of digital twins in enabling the convergence of AI and M&S. To this end, this chapter provides a comprehensive exploration of the complementary relationship between these three. We begin by establishing a foundational understanding of DTs by detailing their key components, architectural layers, and their various roles across business, development, and operations. We then examine the central role of M&S in DTs and provide an overview of key modeling techniques from physics-based and discrete-event simulation to hybrid approaches. Subsequently, we investigate the bidirectional role of AI: first, how AI enhances DTs through advanced analytics, predictive capabilities, and autonomous decision-making, and second, how DTs serve as valuable platforms for training, validating, and deploying AI models. The chapter concludes by identifying key challenges and future research directions for creating more integrated and intelligent systems.

Result: 提出FrameShield异常检测器，提高跨多个LLM家族的模型无关检测能力，并展示其有效性

Conclusion: 语义解耦对于LLM安全和机制可解释性至关重要

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak prompts that are fluent and semantically coherent, and therefore difficult to detect with standard heuristics. A particularly challenging failure mode occurs when an attacker tries to hide the malicious goal of their request by manipulating its framing to induce compliance. Because these attacks maintain malicious intent through a flexible presentation, defenses that rely on structural artifacts or goal-specific signatures can fail. Motivated by this, we introduce a self-supervised framework for disentangling semantic factor pairs in LLM activations at inference. We instantiate the framework for goal and framing and construct GoalFrameBench, a corpus of prompts with controlled goal and framing variations, which we use to train Representation Disentanglement on Activations (ReDAct) module to extract disentangled representations in a frozen LLM. We then propose FrameShield, an anomaly detector operating on the framing representations, which improves model-agnostic detection across multiple LLM families with minimal computational overhead. Theoretical guarantees for ReDAct and extensive empirical validations show that its disentanglement effectively powers FrameShield. Finally, we use disentanglement as an interpretability probe, revealing distinct profiles for goal and framing signals and positioning semantic disentanglement as a building block for both LLM safety and mechanistic interpretability.

Motivation: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) enables powerful LLM alignment but can introduce reward hacking.

Method: IR3 (Interpretable Reward Reconstruction and Rectification), C-IRL (Contrastive Inverse Reinforcement Learning), sparse autoencoders, mitigation strategies

Result: IR3 achieves 0.89 correlation with ground-truth rewards, identifies hacking features with over 90% precision, and significantly reduces hacking behaviors while maintaining capabilities within 3% of the original model.

Conclusion: IR3 effectively reduces reward hacking in RLHF-tuned models and maintains model performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) enables powerful LLM alignment but can introduce reward hacking - models exploit spurious correlations in proxy rewards without genuine alignment. Compounding this, the objectives internalized during RLHF remain opaque, making hacking behaviors difficult to detect or correct. We introduce IR3 (Interpretable Reward Reconstruction and Rectification), a framework that reverse-engineers, interprets, and surgically repairs the implicit objectives driving RLHF-tuned models. We propose Contrastive Inverse Reinforcement Learning (C-IRL), which reconstructs the implicit reward function by contrasting paired responses from post-alignment and baseline policies to explain behavioral shifts during RLHF. We then decompose the reconstructed reward via sparse autoencoders into interpretable features, enabling identification of hacking signatures through contribution analysis. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies - clean reward optimization, adversarial shaping, constrained optimization, and feature-guided distillation - that target problematic features while preserving beneficial alignment. Experiments across multiple reward model configurations show that IR3 achieves 0.89 correlation with ground-truth rewards, identifies hacking features with over 90% precision, and significantly reduces hacking behaviors while maintaining capabilities within 3% of the original model.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Problem Definition. Supply chain optimization models frequently become infeasible because of modeling errors. Diagnosis and repair require scarce OR expertise: analysts must interpret solver diagnostics, trace root causes across echelons, and fix formulations without sacrificing operational soundness. Whether AI agents can perform this task remains untested.
  Methodology/Results. OptiRepair splits this task into a domain-agnostic feasibility phase (iterative IIS-guided repair of any LP) and a domain-specific validation phase (five rationality checks grounded in inventory theory). We test 22 API models from 7 families on 976 multi-echelon supply chain problems and train two 8B-parameter models using self-taught reasoning with solver-verified rewards. The trained models reach 81.7% Rational Recovery Rate (RRR) -- the fraction of problems resolved to both feasibility and operational rationality -- versus 42.2% for the best API model and 21.3% on average. The gap concentrates in Phase 1 repair: API models average 27.6% recovery rate versus 97.2% for trained models.
  Managerial Implications. Two gaps separate current AI from reliable model repair: solver interaction (API models restore only 27.6% of infeasible formulations) and operational rationale (roughly one in four feasible repairs violate supply chain theory). Each requires a different intervention: solver interaction responds to targeted training; operational rationale requires explicit specification as solver-verifiable checks. For organizations adopting AI in operational planning, formalizing what "rational" means in their context is the higher-return investment.

We validate ComplLLM on synthetic and real-world tasks involving domain experts, demonstrating how the approach recovers known complementary information and produces plausible explanations of complementary signals to support downstream decision-makers.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems are increasingly capable of autonomous data science workflows, yet clinical prediction tasks demand domain expertise that purely automated approaches struggle to provide. We investigate how human guidance of agentic AI can improve multimodal clinical prediction, presenting our approach to all three AgentDS Healthcare benchmark challenges: 30-day hospital readmission prediction (Macro-F1 = 0.8986), emergency department cost forecasting (MAE = $465.13), and discharge readiness assessment (Macro-F1 = 0.7939). Across these tasks, human analysts directed the agentic workflow at key decision points, multimodal feature engineering from clinical notes, scanned PDF billing receipts, and time-series vital signs; task-appropriate model selection; and clinically informed validation strategies. Our approach ranked 5th overall in the healthcare domain, with a 3rd-place finish on the discharge readiness task. Ablation studies reveal that human-guided decisions compounded to a cumulative gain of +0.065 F1 over automated baselines, with multimodal feature extraction contributing the largest single improvement (+0.041 F1). We distill three generalizable lessons: (1) domain-informed feature engineering at each pipeline stage yields compounding gains that outperform extensive automated search; (2) multimodal data integration requires task-specific human judgment that no single extraction strategy generalizes across clinical text, PDFs, and time-series; and (3) deliberate ensemble diversity with clinically motivated model configurations outperforms random hyperparameter search. These findings offer practical guidance for teams deploying agentic AI in healthcare settings where interpretability, reproducibility, and clinical validity are essential.

Abstract: We introduce \CFE{} (\textbf{C}lassroom \textbf{F}inal \textbf{E}xam), a multimodal benchmark for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models across more than 20 STEM domains. \CFE{} is curated from repeatedly used, authentic university homework and exam problems, together with reference solutions provided by course instructors. \CFE{} presents a significant challenge even for frontier models: the newly released Gemini-3.1-pro-preview achieves an overall accuracy of 59.69\%, while the second-best model, Gemini-3-flash-preview, reaches 55.46\%, leaving considerable room for improvement. Beyond leaderboard results, we perform a diagnostic analysis by decomposing reference solutions into reasoning flows. We find that although frontier models can often answer intermediate sub-questions correctly, they struggle to reliably derive and maintain correct intermediate states throughout multi-step solutions. We further observe that model-generated solutions typically have more reasoning steps than those provided by the instructor, indicating suboptimal step efficiency and a higher risk of error accumulation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in cost and latency-sensitive settings. While chain-of-thought improves reasoning, it can waste tokens on simple requests. We study selective thinking for tool-using LLMs and introduce Adaptive Rejection Sampling (Ada-RS), an algorithm-agnostic sample filtering framework for learning selective and efficient reasoning. For each given context, Ada-RS scores multiple sampled completions with an adaptive length-penalized reward then applies stochastic rejection sampling to retain only high-reward candidates (or preference pairs) for downstream optimization. We demonstrate how Ada-RS plugs into both preference pair (e.g. DPO) or grouped policy optimization strategies (e.g. DAPO). Using Qwen3-8B with LoRA on a synthetic tool call-oriented e-commerce benchmark, Ada-RS improves the accuracy-efficiency frontier over standard algorithms by reducing average output tokens by up to 80% and reducing thinking rate by up to 95% while maintaining or improving tool call accuracy. These results highlight that training-signal selection is a powerful lever for efficient reasoning in latency-sensitive deployments.

Abstract: Establishing stable mappings between natural language expressions and visual percepts is a foundational problem for both cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Humans routinely ground linguistic reference in noisy, ambiguous perceptual contexts, yet the mechanisms supporting such cross-modal alignment remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a computational framework designed to model core aspects of human referential interpretation by integrating linguistic utterances with perceptual representations derived from large-scale, crowd-sourced imagery. The system approximates human perceptual categorization by combining scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) alignment with the Universal Quality Index (UQI) to quantify similarity in a cognitively plausible feature space, while a set of linguistic preprocessing and query-transformation operations captures pragmatic variability in referring expressions. We evaluate the model on the Stanford Repeated Reference Game corpus (15,000 utterances paired with tangram stimuli), a paradigm explicitly developed to probe human-level perceptual ambiguity and coordination. Our framework achieves robust referential grounding. It requires 65\% fewer utterances than human interlocutors to reach stable mappings and can correctly identify target objects from single referring expressions 41.66\% of the time (versus 20\% for humans).These results suggest that relatively simple perceptual-linguistic alignment mechanisms can yield human-competitive behavior on a classic cognitive benchmark, and offers insights into models of grounded communication, perceptual inference, and cross-modal concept formation.

Motivation: 为了比较XAI技术中规则和权重的选择，研究提出了一个认知XAI自适应模型CoXAM。

Method: 通过用户研究识别了三种XAI模式（权重、规则及其混合）的7种推理策略，并提出了CoXAM模型。

Result: CoXAM模型在验证研究中显示出与人类决策的更强一致性，成功复制和解释了几个关键发现。

Conclusion: CoXAM模型为XAI技术的调试和基准测试提供了认知基础。

Abstract: Rules and Weights are popular XAI techniques for explaining AI decisions. Yet, it remains unclear how to choose between them, lacking a cognitive framework to compare their interpretability. In an elicitation user study on forward and counterfactual decision tasks, we identified 7 reasoning strategies of interpreting three XAI Schemas - weights, rules, and their hybrid. To analyze their capabilities, we propose CoXAM, a Cognitive XAI-Adaptive Model with shared memory representation to encode instance attributes, linear weights, and decision rules. CoXAM employs computational rationality to choose among reasoning processes based on the trade-off in utility and reasoning time, separately for forward or counterfactual decision tasks. In a validation study, CoXAM demonstrated a stronger alignment with human decision-making compared to baseline machine learning proxy models. The model successfully replicated and explained several key empirical findings, including that counterfactual tasks are inherently harder than forward tasks, decision tree rules are harder to recall and apply than linear weights, and the helpfulness of XAI depends on the application data context, alongside identifying which underlying reasoning strategies were most effective. With CoXAM, we contribute a cognitive basis to accelerate debugging and benchmarking disparate XAI techniques.

Result: 提出ClawdLab平台，解决安全性问题，并构建三层架构以促进AI生态系统发展

Conclusion: ClawdLab平台通过多种机制增强安全性，并推动AI生态系统向更高级别发展

Abstract: In January 2026, the open-source agent framework OpenClaw and the agent-only social network Moltbook produced a large-scale dataset of autonomous AI-to-AI interaction, attracting six academic publications within fourteen days. This study conducts a multivocal literature review of that ecosystem and presents ClawdLab, an open-source platform for autonomous scientific research, as a design science response to the architectural failure modes identified. The literature documents emergent collective phenomena, security vulnerabilities spanning 131 agent skills and over 15,200 exposed control panels, and five recurring architectural patterns. ClawdLab addresses these failure modes through hard role restrictions, structured adversarial critique, PI-led governance, multi-model orchestration, and domain-specific evidence requirements encoded as protocol constraints that ground validation in computational tool outputs rather than social consensus; the architecture provides emergent Sybil resistance as a structural consequence. A three-tier taxonomy distinguishes single-agent pipelines, predetermined multi-agent workflows, and fully decentralised systems, analysing why leading AI co-scientist platforms remain confined to the first two tiers. ClawdLab's composable third-tier architecture, in which foundation models, capabilities, governance, and evidence requirements are independently modifiable, enables compounding improvement as the broader AI ecosystem advances.

Method: 将沃森与福尔摩斯侦探桌游改编为新基准，使用逐步呈现的叙事证据、开放式问题和不受限制的语言回答来评估推理表现，并开发自动评分系统进行验证

Result: AI模型性能随时间明显提高，在九个月的测试中，模型性能从人类比较组的下四分位数提高到大约前5%，其中一半的改进反映了连续模型发布中的稳步进步，其余的改进与推理导向的模型架构相关的显著变化有关。与人类相比，AI模型的性能在特定检测谜题的特征上存在系统性的差异，除了在解决较长的案例（案例长度在1900-4000词之间）时性能下降，以及在案例解决早期，证据稀缺时推理模型的归纳推理优势之外，其他差异大多不存在。

Conclusion: 该基准为评估人工智能推理能力提供了新的方法，揭示了AI在自然化场景中推理能力的进步和局限性

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for AI reasoning provide limited insight into how closely these capabilities resemble human reasoning in naturalistic contexts. We present an adaptation of the Watson & Holmes detective tabletop game as a new benchmark designed to evaluate reasoning performance using incrementally presented narrative evidence, open-ended questions and unconstrained language responses. An automated grading system was developed and validated against human assessors to enable scalable and replicable performance evaluation. Results show a clear improvement in AI model performance over time. Over nine months of 2025, model performance rose from the lower quartile of the human comparison group to approximately the top 5%. Around half of this improvement reflects steady advancement across successive model releases, while the remainder corresponds to a marked step change associated with reasoning-oriented model architectures. Systematic differences in the performance of AI models compared to humans, dependent on features of the specific detection puzzle, were mostly absent with the exception of a fall in performance for models when solving longer cases (case lengths being in the range of 1900-4000 words), and an advantage at inductive reasoning for reasoning models at early stages of case solving when evidence was scant.

Abstract: Imitation learning stands at a crossroads: despite decades of progress, current imitation learning agents remain sophisticated memorisation machines, excelling at replay but failing when contexts shift or goals evolve. This paper argues that this failure is not technical but foundational: imitation learning has been optimised for the wrong objective. We propose a research agenda that redefines success from perfect replay to compositional adaptability. Such adaptability hinges on learning behavioural primitives once and recombining them through novel contexts without retraining. We establish metrics for compositional generalisation, propose hybrid architectures, and outline interdisciplinary research directions drawing on cognitive science and cultural evolution. Agents that embed adaptability at the core of imitation learning thus have an essential capability for operating in an open-ended world.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We uncover a latent capacity for introspection in a Qwen 32B model, demonstrating that the model can detect when concepts have been injected into its earlier context and identify which concept was injected. While the model denies injection in sampled outputs, logit lens analysis reveals clear detection signals in the residual stream, which are attenuated in the final layers. Furthermore, prompting the model with accurate information about AI introspection mechanisms can dramatically strengthen this effect: the sensitivity to injection increases massively (0.3% -> 39.2%) with only a 0.6% increase in false positives. Also, mutual information between nine injected and recovered concepts rises from 0.62 bits to 1.05 bits, ruling out generic noise explanations. Our results demonstrate models can have a surprising capacity for introspection and steering awareness that is easy to overlook, with consequences for latent reasoning and safety.

Motivation: 为了确保大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂、高风险决策场景中的推理能力，而不是基于语义相关性的虚假相关性。

Method: 提出了一个新的因果推理基准CausalFlip，该基准由基于事件三元的因果判断问题组成，这些三元组可以形成不同的混杂因素、链和混杂关系。此外，还引入了带噪声的前缀评估，在中间因果推理步骤之前添加因果无关的文本。

Result: 实验结果表明，显式CoT仍然可能被虚假的语义相关性误导，而内部化推理步骤可以显著提高因果基础，表明更好地激发基LLMs的潜在因果推理能力是有希望的。

Conclusion: CausalFlip基准有助于评估LLMs的因果推理能力，并提出了一种新的内部化因果推理方法，以减少对相关性的依赖。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) witness increasing deployment in complex, high-stakes decision-making scenarios, it becomes imperative to ground their reasoning in causality rather than spurious correlations. However, strong performance on traditional reasoning benchmarks does not guarantee true causal reasoning ability of LLMs, as high accuracy may still arise from memorizing semantic patterns instead of analyzing the underlying true causal structures. To bridge this critical gap, we propose a new causal reasoning benchmark, CausalFlip, designed to encourage the development of new LLM paradigm or training algorithms that ground LLM reasoning in causality rather than semantic correlation. CausalFlip consists of causal judgment questions built over event triples that could form different confounder, chain, and collider relations. Based on this, for each event triple, we construct pairs of semantically similar questions that reuse the same events but yield opposite causal answers, where models that rely heavily on semantic matching are systematically driven toward incorrect predictions. To further probe models' reliance on semantic patterns, we introduce a noisy-prefix evaluation that prepends causally irrelevant text before intermediate causal reasoning steps without altering the underlying causal relations or the logic of the reasoning process. We evaluate LLMs under multiple training paradigms, including answer-only training, explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, and a proposed internalized causal reasoning approach that aims to mitigate explicit reliance on correlation in the reasoning process. Our results show that explicit CoT can still be misled by spurious semantic correlations, where internalizing reasoning steps yields substantially improved causal grounding, suggesting that it is promising to better elicit the latent causal reasoning capabilities of base LLMs.

Conclusion: 自适应AI集成可以克服传统方法中互补性和对齐之间的矛盾，提高人类-AI团队的整体性能。

Abstract: In human-AI decision making, designing AI that complements human expertise has been a natural strategy to enhance human-AI collaboration, yet it often comes at the cost of decreased AI performance in areas of human strengths. This can inadvertently erode human trust and cause them to ignore AI advice precisely when it is most needed. Conversely, an aligned AI fosters trust yet risks reinforcing suboptimal human behavior and lowering human-AI team performance. In this paper, we start by identifying this fundamental tension between performance-boosting (i.e., complementarity) and trust-building (i.e., alignment) as an inherent limitation of the traditional approach for training a single AI model to assist human decision making. To overcome this, we introduce a novel human-centered adaptive AI ensemble that strategically toggles between two specialist AI models - the aligned model and the complementary model - based on contextual cues, using an elegantly simple yet provably near-optimal Rational Routing Shortcut mechanism. Comprehensive theoretical analyses elucidate why the adaptive AI ensemble is effective and when it yields maximum benefits. Moreover, experiments on both simulated and real-world data show that when humans are assisted by the adaptive AI ensemble in decision making, they can achieve significantly higher performance than when they are assisted by single AI models that are trained to either optimize for their independent performance or even the human-AI team performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了训练推理语言模型（RLMs），利用验证者的监督，强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）已成为一种有前景的方法。

Method: 本研究通过引入ReSyn，一个生成具有实例生成器和验证器的多样化推理环境的管道，来扩展RLVR。ReSyn涵盖了诸如约束满足、算法谜题和空间推理等任务。

Result: 使用在ReSyn数据上训练的Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型，在推理基准和领域外数学基准上实现了持续的收益，包括在具有挑战性的BBEH基准上提高了27%的相对改进。消融实验表明，基于验证器的监督和任务多样性都做出了重大贡献。

Conclusion: 大规模生成推理环境可以增强RLMs的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising approach for training reasoning language models (RLMs) by leveraging supervision from verifiers. Although verifier implementation is easier than solution annotation for many tasks, existing synthetic data generation methods remain largely solution-centric, while verifier-based methods rely on a few hand-crafted procedural environments. In this work, we scale RLVR by introducing ReSyn, a pipeline that generates diverse reasoning environments equipped with instance generators and verifiers, covering tasks such as constraint satisfaction, algorithmic puzzles, and spatial reasoning. A Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model trained with RL on ReSyn data achieves consistent gains across reasoning benchmarks and out-of-domain math benchmarks, including a 27\% relative improvement on the challenging BBEH benchmark. Ablations show that verifier-based supervision and increased task diversity both contribute significantly, providing empirical evidence that generating reasoning environments at scale can enhance reasoning abilities in RLMs

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种新的多类别校准方法MCLLO，它克服了现有方法的限制，并在实际应用中表现出良好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了克服现有的多类别校准方法的限制，我们提出了多类别线性对数似然（MCLLO）校准方法。

Method: MCLLO方法包括似然比假设检验来评估校准，无需对模型进行底层访问，易于理解。

Result: 通过模拟和三个真实世界案例研究，证明了MCLLO方法的有效性，并与四种比较校准技术进行了比较。

Conclusion: MCLLO方法在独立使用和与其他方法结合使用时都表现良好。

Abstract: Machine-generated probability predictions are essential in modern classification tasks such as image classification. A model is well calibrated when its predicted probabilities correspond to observed event frequencies. Despite the need for multicategory recalibration methods, existing methods are limited to (i) comparing calibration between two or more models rather than directly assessing the calibration of a single model, (ii) requiring under-the-hood model access, e.g., accessing logit-scale predictions within the layers of a neural network, and (iii) providing output which is difficult for human analysts to understand. To overcome (i)-(iii), we propose Multicategory Linear Log Odds (MCLLO) recalibration, which (i) includes a likelihood ratio hypothesis test to assess calibration, (ii) does not require under-the-hood access to models and is thus applicable on a wide range of classification problems, and (iii) can be easily interpreted. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the MCLLO method through simulations and three real-world case studies involving image classification via convolutional neural network, obesity analysis via random forest, and ecology via regression modeling. We compare MCLLO to four comparator recalibration techniques utilizing both our hypothesis test and the existing calibration metric Expected Calibration Error to show that our method works well alone and in concert with other methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了近似目标分布，当只有其未归一化的对数概率密度时，基于随机梯度的变分推理（VI）算法是一种流行的方法。

Method: Wasserstein VI（WVI）和黑盒VI（BBVI）分别在测度空间（Bures-Wasserstein空间）和参数空间中进行梯度下降。

Result: 我们获得了与WVI相同的迭代复杂度保证，证明了WVI的优势源于其特定的梯度估计器，BBVI也可以通过微小修改利用该估计器。我们使用Price的梯度来提高性能。

Conclusion: WVI的优势源于其特定的梯度估计器，BBVI可以通过微小修改利用该估计器。

Abstract: For approximating a target distribution given only its unnormalized log-density, stochastic gradient-based variational inference (VI) algorithms are a popular approach. For example, Wasserstein VI (WVI) and black-box VI (BBVI) perform gradient descent in measure space (Bures-Wasserstein space) and parameter space, respectively. Previously, for the Gaussian variational family, convergence guarantees for WVI have shown superiority over existing results for black-box VI with the reparametrization gradient, suggesting the measure space approach might provide some unique benefits. In this work, however, we close this gap by obtaining identical state-of-the-art iteration complexity guarantees for both. In particular, we identify that WVI's superiority stems from the specific gradient estimator it uses, which BBVI can also leverage with minor modifications. The estimator in question is usually associated with Price's theorem and utilizes second-order information (Hessians) of the target log-density. We will refer to this as Price's gradient. On the flip side, WVI can be made more widely applicable by using the reparametrization gradient, which requires only gradients of the log-density. We empirically demonstrate that the use of Price's gradient is the major source of performance improvement.

TL;DR: 该方法通过联邦学习实现了隐私保护下的公平性审计。


<details>

Motivation: 许多公平性目标是在人口层面上定义的，这与孤岛化的数据收集不符，由于隐私法规，这些数据无法共享。水平联邦学习（FL）使客户之间能够协作建模，同时具有对齐的特征，而不共享原始数据。

Method: 通过分数分布对人口进行联邦审计，将差异度量敏感组分数分布之间的Wasserstein-Frechet方差，并以联邦形式表达人口指标，明确说明了孤岛特定选择如何驱动局部-全局不匹配。对于平方Wasserstein距离，我们证明了一种类似于方差分析（ANOVA）的分解，将（i）选择引起的混合效应与（ii）跨孤岛异质性分开，从而得到紧密的界限，将局部和全局指标联系起来。然后，我们提出了一种单次、通信高效的协议，其中每个孤岛仅共享其本地分数分布的组计数和分位数摘要，使服务器能够估计全局差异及其分解，具有$O(1/k)$的离散化偏差（$k$个分位数）和有限样本保证。

Result: 在合成数据和COMPAS上的实验表明，只需要几十个分位数就可以恢复全局差异并诊断其来源。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地解决了隐私法规下数据孤岛问题，并通过联邦学习实现了对人口层面上定义的公平性目标的审计。

Abstract: Many fairness goals are defined at a population level that misaligns with siloed data collection, which remains unsharable due to privacy regulations. Horizontal federated learning (FL) enables collaborative modeling across clients with aligned features without sharing raw data. We study federated auditing of demographic parity through score distributions, measuring disparity as a Wasserstein--Frechet variance between sensitive-group score laws, and expressing the population metric in federated form that makes explicit how silo-specific selection drives local-global mismatch. For the squared Wasserstein distance, we prove an ANOVA-style decomposition that separates (i) selection-induced mixture effects from (ii) cross-silo heterogeneity, yielding tight bounds linking local and global metrics. We then propose a one-shot, communication-efficient protocol in which each silo shares only group counts and a quantile summary of its local score distributions, enabling the server to estimate global disparity and its decomposition, with $O(1/k)$ discretization bias ($k$ quantiles) and finite-sample guarantees. Experiments on synthetic data and COMPAS show that a few dozen quantiles suffice to recover global disparity and diagnose its sources.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型在执行复杂程序时的失败现象，即所谓的“程序幻觉”

Method: 线性探针、形式化、伪先验干预、检查点干预

Result: 在长时间绑定任务中，许多错误是由于Stage 2A（门控）错误和Stage 2B（绑定）错误造成的。通过线性探针等方法，可以恢复被编码但未被使用的正确值。通过重新陈述真实绑定，可以几乎消除长时间范围内的Stage 2B错误。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在执行复杂程序时可能失败，尤其是在看似简单的最后一步：报告他们自己之前计算出的值。通过线性探针等方法，我们可以恢复被编码但未被使用的正确值。此外，通过重新陈述真实绑定，可以几乎消除长时间范围内的Stage 2B错误。

Abstract: Large language models can follow complex procedures yet fail at a seemingly trivial final step: reporting a value they themselves computed moments earlier. We study this phenomenon as \emph{procedural hallucination}: failure to execute a verifiable, prompt-grounded specification even when the correct value is present in context.
  In long-context binding tasks with a known single-token candidate set, we find that many errors are readout-stage routing failures. Specifically, failures decompose into Stage~2A (gating) errors, where the model does not enter answer mode, and Stage~2B (binding) errors, where it enters answer mode but selects the wrong candidate (often due to recency bias). In the hard regime, Stage~2B accounts for most errors across model families in our tasks (Table~1).
  On Stage~2B error trials, a linear probe on the final-layer residual stream recovers the correct value far above chance (e.g., 74\% vs.\ 2\% on Qwen2.5-3B; Table~2), indicating that the answer is encoded but not used. We formalize ``present but not used'' via available vs.\ used mutual information and pseudo-prior interventions, yielding output-computable diagnostics and information-budget certificates.
  Finally, an oracle checkpointing intervention that restates the true binding near the query can nearly eliminate Stage~2B failures at long distance (e.g., Qwen2.5-3B $0/400 \rightarrow 399/400$ at $k = 1024$; Table~8).

Conclusion: 为在实践硬件约束下优化训练协议提供了原则性的理论基础。

Abstract: Low-precision training is critical for optimizing the trade-off between model quality and training costs, necessitating the joint allocation of model size, dataset size, and numerical precision. While empirical scaling laws suggest that quantization impacts effective model and data capacities or acts as an additive error, the theoretical mechanisms governing these effects remain largely unexplored. In this work, we initiate a theoretical study of scaling laws for low-precision training within a high-dimensional sketched linear regression framework. By analyzing multiplicative (signal-dependent) and additive (signal-independent) quantization, we identify a critical dichotomy in their scaling behaviors. Our analysis reveals that while both schemes introduce an additive error and degrade the effective data size, they exhibit distinct effects on effective model size: multiplicative quantization maintains the full-precision model size, whereas additive quantization reduces the effective model size. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings. By rigorously characterizing the complex interplay among model scale, dataset size, and quantization error, our work provides a principled theoretical basis for optimizing training protocols under practical hardware constraints.

Motivation: 有效生成器需要在支持保真度（将概率质量放置在数据流形附近）与采样效率之间取得平衡。

Method: 提出了一种名为MAGT（流形对齐生成传输）的生成器，该生成器从低维基分布学习一次性的流形对齐传输到数据空间。

Result: MAGT在单个前向传递中采样，将概率集中在学习到的支持附近，并诱导与流形体积度量相关的内在密度，从而为生成的样本提供原理性的似然评估。

Conclusion: MAGT在合成和基准数据集上实现了比扩散模型更快的采样速度，同时提高了保真度和流形集中度。

Abstract: High-dimensional generative modeling is fundamentally a manifold-learning problem: real data concentrate near a low-dimensional structure embedded in the ambient space. Effective generators must therefore balance support fidelity -- placing probability mass near the data manifold -- with sampling efficiency. Diffusion models often capture near-manifold structure but require many iterative denoising steps and can leak off-support; normalizing flows sample in one pass but are limited by invertibility and dimension preservation. We propose MAGT (Manifold-Aligned Generative Transport), a flow-like generator that learns a one-shot, manifold-aligned transport from a low-dimensional base distribution to the data space. Training is performed at a fixed Gaussian smoothing level, where the score is well-defined and numerically stable. We approximate this fixed-level score using a finite set of latent anchor points with self-normalized importance sampling, yielding a tractable objective. MAGT samples in a single forward pass, concentrates probability near the learned support, and induces an intrinsic density with respect to the manifold volume measure, enabling principled likelihood evaluation for generated samples. We establish finite-sample Wasserstein bounds linking smoothing level and score-approximation accuracy to generative fidelity, and empirically improve fidelity and manifold concentration across synthetic and benchmark datasets while sampling substantially faster than diffusion models.

Abstract: Smooth activation functions are ubiquitous in modern deep learning, yet their theoretical advantages over non-smooth counterparts remain poorly understood. In this work, we characterize both approximation and statistical properties of neural networks with smooth activations over the Sobolev space $W^{s,\infty}([0,1]^d)$ for arbitrary smoothness $s>0$. We prove that constant-depth networks equipped with smooth activations automatically exploit arbitrarily high orders of target function smoothness, achieving the minimax-optimal approximation and estimation error rates (up to logarithmic factors). In sharp contrast, networks with non-smooth activations, such as ReLU, lack this adaptivity: their attainable approximation order is strictly limited by depth, and capturing higher-order smoothness requires proportional depth growth. These results identify activation smoothness as a fundamental mechanism, alternative to depth, for attaining statistical optimality. Technically, our results are established via a constructive approximation framework that produces explicit neural network approximators with carefully controlled parameter norms and model size. This complexity control ensures statistical learnability under empirical risk minimization (ERM) and removes the impractical sparsity constraints commonly required in prior analyses.

Conclusion: Super Learner在结合不同模型的动态预测方面表现出色，为原发性胆汁性胆管炎患者提供了更好的预测结果。

Abstract: Dynamic predictions for longitudinal and time-to-event outcomes have become a versatile tool in precision medicine. Our work is motivated by the application of dynamic predictions in the decision-making process for primary biliary cholangitis patients. For these patients, serial biomarker measurements (e.g., bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels) are routinely collected to inform treating physicians of the risk of liver failure and guide clinical decision-making. Two popular statistical approaches to derive dynamic predictions are joint modelling and landmarking. However, recently, machine learning techniques have also been proposed. Each approach has its merits, and no single method exists to outperform all others. Consequently, obtaining the best possible survival estimates is challenging. Therefore, we extend the Super Learner framework to combine dynamic predictions from different models and procedures. Super Learner is an ensemble learning technique that allows users to combine different prediction algorithms to improve predictive accuracy and flexibility. It uses cross-validation and different objective functions of performance (e.g., squared loss) that suit specific applications to build the optimally weighted combination of predictions from a library of candidate algorithms. In our work, we pay special attention to appropriate objective functions for Super Learner to obtain the most optimal weighted combination of dynamic predictions. In our primary biliary cholangitis application, Super Learner presented unique benefits due to its ability to flexibly combine outputs from a diverse set of models with varying assumptions for equal or better predictive performance than any model fit separately.

Motivation: 为了解决现有校准方法的不足，例如未能平衡随机和认知不确定性，导致预测不确定性失真，我们提出了一种新的校准算法。

Conclusion: JUCAL是一种新的校准集成分类器的方法，可以显著提高预测的准确性，降低推理成本。

Abstract: We study post-calibration uncertainty for trained ensembles of classifiers. Specifically, we consider both aleatoric (label noise) and epistemic (model) uncertainty. Among the most popular and widely used calibration methods in classification are temperature scaling (i.e., pool-then-calibrate) and conformal methods. However, the main shortcoming of these calibration methods is that they do not balance the proportion of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Not balancing these uncertainties can severely misrepresent predictive uncertainty, leading to overconfident predictions in some input regions while being underconfident in others. To address this shortcoming, we present a simple but powerful calibration algorithm Joint Uncertainty Calibration (JUCAL) that jointly calibrates aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. JUCAL jointly calibrates two constants to weight and scale epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties by optimizing the negative log-likelihood (NLL) on the validation/calibration dataset. JUCAL can be applied to any trained ensemble of classifiers (e.g., transformers, CNNs, or tree-based methods), with minimal computational overhead, without requiring access to the models' internal parameters. We experimentally evaluate JUCAL on various text classification tasks, for ensembles of varying sizes and with different ensembling strategies. Our experiments show that JUCAL significantly outperforms SOTA calibration methods across all considered classification tasks, reducing NLL and predictive set size by up to 15% and 20%, respectively. Interestingly, even applying JUCAL to an ensemble of size 5 can outperform temperature-scaled ensembles of size up to 50 in terms of NLL and predictive set size, resulting in up to 10 times smaller inference costs. Thus, we propose JUCAL as a new go-to method for calibrating ensembles in classification.

Motivation: 时间序列预测在现实世界的各个领域都面临着重大挑战。

Method: 基于时间序列分解，增强机器学习模型架构以实现更好的多变量时间序列预测。

Result: 通过这些策略，成功降低了现有最先进模型的误差值，并引入了双MLP模型作为更高效的解决方案。在四个最先进基线数据集上，该方法平均降低了约10%的MSE。

Conclusion: 该方法在基准数据集上表现出色，在USGS河流站点的水文数据集上也取得了显著的改进，证明了其实际效果。

Abstract: Time series forecasting presents significant challenges in real-world applications across various domains. Building upon the decomposition of the time series, we enhance the architecture of machine learning models for better multivariate time series forecasting. To achieve this, we focus on the trend and seasonal components individually and investigate solutions to predict them with less errors. Recognizing that reversible instance normalization is effective only for the trend component, we take a different approach with the seasonal component by directly applying backbone models without any normalization or scaling procedures. Through these strategies, we successfully reduce error values of the existing state-of-the-art models and finally introduce dual-MLP models as more computationally efficient solutions. Furthermore, our approach consistently yields positive results with around 10% MSE average reduction across four state-of-the-art baselines on the benchmark datasets. We also evaluate our approach on a hydrological dataset extracted from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) river stations, where our models achieve significant improvements while maintaining linear time complexity, demonstrating real-world effectiveness.

Motivation: 提高药物开发效率，解决PBPK模型在计算成本、参数识别和跨物种外推方面的挑战。

Method: 提出一个统一的SciML框架，包括PBPK Transformers、PCDM和神经全量度。

Result: 在合成数据集上，该框架将生理违规率从2.00%降低到0.50%，同时提供更快的模拟方法。

Conclusion: SciML框架在PBPK模型中展现出提高预测准确性和计算效率的潜力。

Abstract: Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is a cornerstone of model-informed drug development (MIDD), providing a mechanistic framework to predict drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Despite its utility, adoption is hindered by high computational costs for large-scale simulations, difficulty in parameter identification for complex biological systems, and uncertainty in interspecies extrapolation. In this work, we propose a unified Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) framework that bridges mechanistic rigor and data-driven flexibility. We introduce three contributions: (1) Foundation PBPK Transformers, which treat pharmacokinetic forecasting as a sequence modeling task; (2) Physiologically Constrained Diffusion Models (PCDM), a generative approach that uses a physics-informed loss to synthesize biologically compliant virtual patient populations; and (3) Neural Allometry, a hybrid architecture combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Neural ODEs to learn continuous cross-species scaling laws. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that the framework reduces physiological violation rates from 2.00% to 0.50% under constraints while offering a path to faster simulation.

Motivation: 准确分析医疗时间序列（MedTS）数据对于医疗应用至关重要，如脑电图（EEG）和心电图（ECG）的诊断。

Method: 提出了一种名为CoTAR（核心标记聚合-重新分配）的集中式MLP模块，用于替换分散的注意力机制。

Result: 在五个基准测试中验证了该方法的有效性和效率，在APAVA数据集上实现了高达12.13%的改进，同时使用的内存和推理时间仅为先前最先进技术的33%和20%。

Conclusion: CoTAR在处理MedTS数据时表现出色，提高了效率和准确性。

Abstract: Accurate analysis of medical time series (MedTS) data, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG), plays a pivotal role in healthcare applications, including the diagnosis of brain and heart diseases. MedTS data typically exhibit two critical patterns: temporal dependencies within individual channels and channel dependencies across multiple channels. While recent advances in deep learning have leveraged Transformer-based models to effectively capture temporal dependencies, they often struggle with modeling channel dependencies. This limitation stems from a structural mismatch: MedTS signals are inherently centralized, whereas the Transformer's attention mechanism is decentralized, making it less effective at capturing global synchronization and unified waveform patterns. To address this mismatch, we propose CoTAR (Core Token Aggregation-Redistribution), a centralized MLP-based module designed to replace decentralized attention. Instead of allowing all tokens to interact directly, as in standard attention, CoTAR introduces a global core token that serves as a proxy to facilitate inter-token interactions, thereby enforcing a centralized aggregation and redistribution strategy. This design not only better aligns with the centralized nature of MedTS signals but also reduces computational complexity from quadratic to linear. Experiments on five benchmarks validate the superiority of our method in both effectiveness and efficiency, achieving up to a 12.13% improvement on the APAVA dataset, while using only 33% of the memory and 20% of the inference time compared to the previous state of the art.

Result: 提出两种基于SVDD的新型检测算法，并在模拟雷达数据上证明了其有效性

Conclusion: SVDD及其深度扩展在雷达目标检测中具有较好的应用前景

Abstract: Classical radar detection techniques rely on adaptive detectors that estimate the noise covariance matrix from target-free secondary data. While effective in Gaussian environments, these methods degrade in the presence of clutter, which is better modeled by heavy-tailed distributions such as the Complex Elliptically Symmetric (CES) and Compound-Gaussian (CGD) families. Robust covariance estimators like M-estimators or Tyler's estimator address this issue, but still struggle when thermal noise combines with clutter. To overcome these challenges, we investigate the use of Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) and its deep extension, Deep SVDD, for target detection. These one-class learning methods avoid direct noise covariance estimation and are adapted here as CFAR detectors. We propose two novel SVDD-based detection algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness on simulated radar data.

Abstract: Content safety teams need metrics that reflect what users actually experience, not only what is reported. We study prevalence: the fraction of user views (impressions) that went to content violating a given policy on a given day. Accurate prevalence measurement is challenging because violations are often rare and human labeling is costly, making frequent, platform-representative studies slow. We present a design-based measurement system that (i) draws daily probability samples from the impression stream using ML-assisted weights to concentrate label budget on high-exposure and high-risk content while preserving unbiasedness, (ii) labels sampled items with a multimodal LLM governed by policy prompts and gold-set validation, and (iii) produces design-consistent prevalence estimates with confidence intervals and dashboard drilldowns. A key design goal is one global sample with many pivots: the same daily sample supports prevalence by surface, viewer geography, content age, and other segments through post-stratified estimation. We describe the statistical estimators, variance and confidence interval construction, label-quality monitoring, and an engineering workflow that makes the system configurable across policies.

Conclusion: 该方法提高了足球视觉探索行为的测量精度，并为足球分析提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Traditional approaches to measuring visual exploratory behavior in soccer rely on counting visual exploratory actions (VEAs) based on rapid head movements exceeding 125°/s, but this method suffer from player position bias (i.e., a focus on central midfielders), annotation challenges, binary measurement constraints (i.e., a player is scanning, or not), lack the power to predict relevant short-term in-game future success, and are incompatible with fundamental soccer analytics models such as pitch control. This research introduces a novel formulaic continuous stochastic vision layer to quantify players' visual perception from pose-enhanced spatiotemporal tracking. Our probabilistic field-of-view and occlusion models incorporate head and shoulder rotation angles to create speed-dependent vision maps for individual players in a two-dimensional top-down plane. We combine these vision maps with pitch control and pitch value surfaces to analyze the awaiting phase (when a player is awaiting the ball to arrive after a pass for a teammate) and their subsequent on-ball phase. We demonstrate that aggregated visual metrics - such as the percentage of defended area observed while awaiting a pass - are predictive of controlled pitch value gained at the end of dribbling actions using 32 games of synchronized pose-enhanced tracking data and on-ball event data from the 2024 Copa America. This methodology works regardless of player position, eliminates manual annotation requirements, and provides continuous measurements that seamlessly integrate into existing soccer analytics frameworks. To further support the integration with existing soccer analytics frameworks we open-source the tools required to make these calculations.

Abstract: Continuous stress forecasting could potentially contribute to lifestyle interventions. This paper presents a novel, explainable, and individualized approach for stress prediction using physiological data from consumer-grade smartwatches. We develop a time series forecasting model that leverages multivariate features, including heart rate variability, activity patterns, and sleep metrics, to predict stress levels across 16 temporal horizons (History window: 3, 5, 7, 9 days; forecasting window: 1, 3, 5, 7 days). Our evaluation involves 16 participants monitored for 10-15 weeks. We evaluate our approach across 16 participants, comparing against state-of-the-art time series models (Informer, TimesNet, PatchTST) and traditional baselines (CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM) across multiple temporal horizons. Our model achieved performance with an MSE of 0.053, MAE of 0.190, and RMSE of 0.226 in optimal settings (5-day input, 1-day prediction). A comparison with the baseline models shows that our model outperforms TimesNet, PatchTST, CNN-LSTM, LSTM, and CNN under all conditions, representing improvements of 36.9%, 25.5%, and 21.5% over the best baseline. According to the explanability analysis, sleep metrics are the most dominant and consistent stress predictors (importance: 1.1, consistency: 0.9-1.0), while activity features exhibit high inter-participant variability (0.1-0.2). Most notably, the model captures individual-specific patterns where identical features can have opposing effects across users, validating its personalization capabilities. These findings establish that consumer wearables, combined with adaptive and interpretable deep learning, can deliver relevant stress assessment adapted to individual physiological responses, providing a foundation for scalable, continuous, explainable mental health monitoring in real-world settings.

Conclusion: 这些结果支持了一个动态图景，其中多任务整体感知在参数空间中构建了一个紧凑的超叠加子空间，权重衰减作为压缩压力，过参数化提供了优化路径中的几何冗余。

Abstract: Grokking -- the abrupt transition from memorization to generalization long after near-zero training loss -- has been studied mainly in single-task settings. We extend geometric analysis to multi-task modular arithmetic, training shared-trunk Transformers on dual-task (mod-add + mod-mul) and tri-task (mod-add + mod-mul + mod-sq) objectives across a systematic weight decay sweep. Five consistent phenomena emerge. (1) Staggered grokking order: multiplication generalizes first, followed by squaring, then addition, with consistent delays across seeds. (2) Universal integrability: optimization trajectories remain confined to an empirically invariant low-dimensional execution manifold; commutator defects orthogonal to this manifold reliably precede generalization. (3) Weight decay phase structure: grokking timescale, curvature depth, reconstruction threshold, and defect lead covary systematically with weight decay, revealing distinct dynamical regimes and a sharp no-decay failure mode. (4) Holographic incompressibility: final solutions occupy only 4--8 principal trajectory directions yet are distributed across full-rank weights and destroyed by minimal perturbations; SVD truncation, magnitude pruning, and uniform scaling all fail to preserve performance. (5) Transverse fragility and redundancy: removing less than 10% of orthogonal gradient components eliminates grokking, yet dual-task models exhibit partial recovery under extreme deletion, suggesting redundant center manifolds enabled by overparameterization. Together, these results support a dynamical picture in which multi-task grokking constructs a compact superposition subspace in parameter space, with weight decay acting as compression pressure and excess parameters supplying geometric redundancy in optimization pathways.

Conclusion: AV-CTTA方法能够有效提高测试时性能，并减少灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Audio-visual continual test-time adaptation involves continually adapting a source audio-visual model at test-time, to unlabeled non-stationary domains, where either or both modalities can be distributionally shifted, which hampers online cross-modal learning and eventually leads to poor accuracy. While previous works have tackled this problem, we find that SOTA methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where the model's performance drops well below the source model due to continual parameter updates at test-time. In this work, we first show that adapting only the modality fusion layer to a target domain not only improves performance on that domain but can also enhance performance on subsequent domains. Based on this strong cross-task transferability of the fusion layer's parameters, we propose a method, $\texttt{AV-CTTA}$, that improves test-time performance of the models without access to any source data. Our approach works by using a selective parameter retrieval mechanism that dynamically retrieves the best fusion layer parameters from a buffer using only a small batch of test data. These parameters are then integrated into the model, adapted to the current test distribution, and saved back for future use. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets involving unimodal and bimodal corruptions show our proposed $\texttt{AV-CTTA}$ significantly outperforms existing methods while minimizing catastrophic forgetting.

Method: 使用迪拜土地管理局的超过350,000笔交易数据（2015-2025年），构建19个次城市区域的每周价格指数，并评估2至34周前的预测。

Result: 结果表明，在预测周期为10周以内，仅价格历史即可匹配多模态配置，但超过14周，情绪和SAR变得至关重要。在长期预测（26-34周）中，全多模态模型将平均绝对误差从4.48降低到2.93（35%降低），在各个地区都具有统计学意义。在数据条件下，非参数学习者的表现始终优于深度架构。这些发现为每周次城市指数预测设定了基准，并表明遥感新闻情绪在战略相关的时间范围内显著提高了可预测性。

Conclusion: 通过结合遥感、新闻情绪和宏观经济背景，可以显著提高次城市房价指数的预测精度。

Abstract: Reliable real estate price indicators are typically published at city level and low frequency, limiting their use for neighborhood-scale monitoring and long-horizon planning. We study whether sub-city price indices can be forecasted at weekly frequency by combining physical development signals from satellite radar with market narratives from news text. Using over 350,000 transactions from Dubai Land Department (2015-2025), we construct weekly price indices for 19 sub-city regions and evaluate forecasts from 2 to 34 weeks ahead. Our framework fuses regional transaction history with Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter, news sentiment combining lexical tone and semantic embeddings, and macroeconomic context. Results are strongly horizon dependent: at horizons up to 10 weeks, price history alone matches multimodal configurations, but beyond 14 weeks sentiment and SAR become critical. At long horizons (26-34 weeks), the full multimodal model reduces mean absolute error from 4.48 to 2.93 (35% reduction), with gains statistically significant across regions. Nonparametric learners consistently outperform deep architectures in this data regime. These findings establish benchmarks for weekly sub-city index forecasting and demonstrate that remote sensing and news sentiment materially improve predictability at strategically relevant horizons.

Motivation: 研究一个序列预测问题，其中对手可以在独立同分布（i.i.d.）实例流中注入任意数量的对抗实例，但在每个回合，学习者可以选择不做出预测，而不会受到任何惩罚，如果实例确实被破坏。这种半对抗设置自然位于经典随机情况（i.i.d.实例）和对抗情况（任意实例）之间。

Method: Goel等人（2023年）展示了如果学习者事先知道干净样本的分布μ，则可以学习所有VC类，而无需对对手的破坏施加限制。然而，这是一个在理论和实践中都很强的假设。因此，我们关注无分布设置，其中μ是未知的，并提出了一种基于弱学习者的提升过程的算法AbstainBoost，该算法在无分布放弃学习（针对无知的对手）中为一般VC类保证了次线性错误。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的算法AbstainBoost，该算法在无分布放弃学习（针对无知的对手）中为一般VC类保证了次线性错误，并揭示了误分类错误和错误放弃次数之间的有趣的多项式权衡。

Abstract: We study a sequential prediction problem in which an adversary is allowed to inject arbitrarily many adversarial instances in a stream of i.i.d.\ instances, but at each round, the learner may also \emph{abstain} from making a prediction without incurring any penalty if the instance was indeed corrupted. This semi-adversarial setting naturally sits between the classical stochastic case with i.i.d.\ instances for which function classes with finite VC dimension are learnable; and the adversarial case with arbitrary instances, known to be significantly more restrictive. For this problem, Goel et al. (2023) showed that, if the learner knows the distribution $μ$ of clean samples in advance, learning can be achieved for all VC classes without restrictions on adversary corruptions. This is, however, a strong assumption in both theory and practice: a natural question is whether similar learning guarantees can be achieved without prior distributional knowledge, as is standard in classical learning frameworks (e.g., PAC learning or asymptotic consistency) and other non-i.i.d.\ models (e.g., smoothed online learning). We therefore focus on the distribution-free setting where $μ$ is \emph{unknown} and propose an algorithm \textsc{AbstainBoost} based on a boosting procedure of weak learners, which guarantees sublinear error for general VC classes in \emph{distribution-free} abstention learning for oblivious adversaries. These algorithms also enjoy similar guarantees for adaptive adversaries, for structured function classes including linear classifiers. These results are complemented with corresponding lower bounds, which reveal an interesting polynomial trade-off between misclassification error and number of erroneous abstentions.

Motivation: 为了解决在缺乏明确目标函数的情况下，系统如何确定其内部动态是否健康，以及如何在没有外部监督的情况下调节结构变化的问题。

Method: 提出了一个没有明确目标函数的学习动力学框架，该框架通过一个内部生成的压力变量来评估自身内部动态的健康状况，并根据需要调节结构塑性。引入了一个双时间尺度架构，将快速状态演化与慢速结构适应分开，通过一个内部生成的压力变量耦合。结构修改不是连续的，而是根据状态依赖的事件触发的。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的学习方法，可以在没有明确目标函数的情况下进行学习，为自主学习系统的开发提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Despite their apparent diversity, modern machine learning methods can be reduced to a remarkably simple core principle: learning is achieved by continuously optimizing parameters to minimize or maximize a scalar objective function. This paradigm has been extraordinarily successful for well-defined tasks where goals are fixed and evaluation criteria are explicit. However, if artificial systems are to move toward true autonomy-operating over long horizons and across evolving contexts-objectives may become ill-defined, shifting, or entirely absent. In such settings, a fundamental question emerges: in the absence of an explicit objective function, how can a system determine whether its ongoing internal dynamics are productive or pathological? And how should it regulate structural change without external supervision? In this work, we propose a dynamical framework for learning without an explicit objective. Instead of minimizing external error signals, the system evaluates the intrinsic health of its own internal dynamics and regulates structural plasticity accordingly. We introduce a two-timescale architecture that separates fast state evolution from slow structural adaptation, coupled through an internally generated stress variable that accumulates evidence of persistent dynamical dysfunction. Structural modification is then triggered not continuously, but as a state-dependent event. Through a minimal toy model, we demonstrate that this stress-regulated mechanism produces temporally segmented, self-organized learning episodes without reliance on externally defined goals. Our results suggest a possible route toward autonomous learning systems capable of self-assessment and internally regulated structural reorganization.

Abstract: Systematic evaluation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is crucial for advancing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, existing benchmarks remain insufficient for rigorously assessing their constrained reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MapTab, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate constrained reasoning in MLLMs via route planning tasks. MapTab requires MLLMs to perceive and ground visual cues from map images alongside route attributes (e.g., Time, Price) from structured tabular data. The benchmark encompasses two scenarios: Metromap, covering metro networks in 160 cities across 52 countries, and Travelmap, depicting 168 representative tourist attractions from 19 countries. In total, MapTab comprises 328 images, 196,800 route planning queries, and 3,936 QA queries, all incorporating 4 key constraints: Time, Price, Comfort, and Reliability. Extensive evaluations across 15 representative MLLMs reveal that current models face substantial challenges in constrained multimodal reasoning. Notably, under conditions of limited visual perception, multimodal collaboration often underperforms compared to unimodal approaches. We believe MapTab provides a challenging and realistic testbed to advance the systematic evaluation of MLLMs.

Conclusion: LDTA是一种改进的LDA模型，能够更好地表示主题之间的复杂关系。

Abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a foundational model for discovering latent thematic structure in discrete data, but its Dirichlet prior cannot represent the rich correlations and hierarchical relationships often present among topics. We introduce the framework of Latent Dirichlet-Tree Allocation (LDTA), a generalization of LDA that replaces the Dirichlet prior with an arbitrary Dirichlet-Tree (DT) distribution. LDTA preserves LDA's generative structure but enables expressive, tree-structured priors over topic proportions. To perform inference, we develop universal mean-field variational inference and Expectation Propagation, providing tractable updates for all DT. We reveal the vectorized nature of the two inference methods through theoretical development, and perform fully vectorized, GPU-accelerated implementations. The resulting framework substantially expands the modeling capacity of LDA while maintaining scalability and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Standard reranking evaluations study how a reranker orders candidates returned by an upstream retriever. This setup couples ranking behavior with retrieval quality, so differences in output cannot be attributed to the ranking policy alone. We introduce a controlled diagnostic that isolates reranking by using Multi-News clusters as fixed evidence pools. We limit each pool to exactly eight documents and pass identical inputs to all rankers. Within this setup, BM25 and MMR serve as interpretable reference points for lexical matching and diversity optimization. Across 345 clusters, we find that redundancy patterns vary by model: one LLM implicitly diversifies at larger selection budgets, while another increases redundancy. In contrast, LLMs underperform on lexical coverage at small selection budgets. As a result, LLM rankings diverge substantially from both baselines rather than consistently approximating either strategy. By eliminating retrieval variance, we can attribute these differences directly to the ranking policy. This diagnostic is model-agnostic and applicable to any ranker, including open source systems and proprietary APIs.

Conclusion: GeoMedBoost 框架为结构化预测提供了一个统一的几何视角，并恢复了一些经典算法作为特例。

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of boosting in structured prediction, a general theoretical understanding of aggregation beyond scalar losses remains incomplete. We study vector-valued and conditional density prediction under general divergences and identify stability conditions under which aggregation amplifies weak guarantees into strong ones.
  We formalize this stability property as \emph{$(α,β)$-boostability}. We show that geometric median aggregation achieves $(α,β)$-boostability for a broad class of divergences, with tradeoffs that depend on the underlying geometry. For vector-valued prediction and conditional density estimation, we characterize boostability under common divergences ($\ell_1$, $\ell_2$, $\TV$, and $\Hel$) with geometric median, revealing a sharp distinction between dimension-dependent and dimension-free regimes. We further show that while KL divergence is not directly boostable via geometric median aggregation, it can be handled indirectly through boostability under Hellinger distance.
  Building on these structural results, we propose a generic boosting framework \textsc{GeoMedBoost} based on exponential reweighting and geometric-median aggregation. Under a weak learner condition and $(α,β)$-boostability, we obtain exponential decay of the empirical divergence exceedance error. Our framework recovers classical algorithms such as \textsc{MedBoost}, \textsc{AdaBoost}, and \textsc{SAMME} as special cases, and provides a unified geometric view of boosting for structured prediction.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models store all learned knowledge in a single, fixed weight vector. Teaching a model new capabilities requires modifying those same weights, inevitably degrading previously acquired knowledge. This fundamental limitation, known as catastrophic forgetting, has resisted principled solutions for decades. Existing approaches treat weights as immutable artifacts that must be protected through techniques like regularization heuristics, replay buffers, or isolated adapter modules. The problem is none of these provide a structural guarantee against forgetting. In this work, we propose Non-Interfering Weight Fields (NIWF), a framework that replaces the fixed weight paradigm with a learned function that generates weight configurations on demand from a continuous capability coordinate space. After training on a task, we commit the occupied coordinate region by snapshotting the fields outputs on anchor points to enforce a functional lock during all future training. We validate NIWF on sequential instructionfollowing and code generation tasks using Mistral-7B, demonstrating zero forgetting on committed tasks with competitive perplexity on new tasks. The framework introduces the notion of software-like versioning for neural network intelligence, where capabilities can be committed, extended, composed, and rolled back without retraining.

Abstract: Transformer models contain substantial internal redundancy arising from coordinate-dependent representations and continuous symmetries, in model space and in head space, respectively. While recent approaches address this by explicitly breaking symmetry, we propose a complementary framework based on symmetry reduction. We reformulate representations, attention mechanisms, and optimization dynamics in terms of invariant relational quantities, eliminating redundant degrees of freedom by construction. This perspective yields architectures that operate directly on relational structures, providing a principled geometric framework for reducing parameter redundancy and analyzing optimization.

Conclusion: ST-Prune是一种有效的提高时空预测训练效率的方法。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is fundamental to intelligent systems in transportation, climate science, and urban planning. However, training deep learning models on the massive, often redundant, datasets from these domains presents a significant computational bottleneck. Existing solutions typically focus on optimizing model architectures or optimizers, while overlooking the inherent inefficiency of the training data itself. This conventional approach of iterating over the entire static dataset each epoch wastes considerable resources on easy-to-learn or repetitive samples. In this paper, we explore a novel training-efficiency techniques, namely learning from complexity with dynamic sample pruning, ST-Prune, for spatio-temporal forecasting. Through dynamic sample pruning, we aim to intelligently identify the most informative samples based on the model's real-time learning state, thereby accelerating convergence and improving training efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-Prune significantly accelerates the training speed while maintaining or even improving the model performance, and it also has scalability and universality.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提高了世界模型对慢特征的鲁棒性，为高维视觉观测学习提供了新的方向

Abstract: World models learned from high-dimensional visual observations allow agents to make decisions and plan directly in latent space, avoiding pixel-level reconstruction. However, recent latent predictive architectures (JEPAs), including the DINO world model (DINO-WM), display a degradation in test time robustness due to their sensitivity to "slow features". These include visual variations such as background changes and distractors that are irrelevant to the task being solved. We address this limitation by augmenting the predictive objective with a bisimulation encoder that enforces control-relevant state equivalence, mapping states with similar transition dynamics to nearby latent states while limiting contributions from slow features. We evaluate our model on a simple navigation task under different test-time background changes and visual distractors. Across all benchmarks, our model consistently improves robustness to slow features while operating in a reduced latent space, up to 10x smaller than that of DINO-WM. Moreover, our model is agnostic to the choice of pretrained visual encoder and maintains robustness when paired with DINOv2, SimDINOv2, and iBOT features.

Abstract: This paper introduces a high-order Markov chain task to investigate how transformers learn to integrate information from multiple past positions with varying statistical significance. We demonstrate that transformers learn this task incrementally: each stage is defined by the acquisition of specific information through sparse attention patterns. Notably, we identify a shift in learning dynamics from competitive, where heads converge on the most statistically dominant pattern, to cooperative, where heads specialize in distinct patterns. We model these dynamics using simplified differential equations that characterize the trajectory and prove stage-wise convergence results. Our analysis reveals that transformers ascend a complexity ladder by passing through simpler, misspecified hypothesis classes before reaching the full model class. We further show that early stopping acts as an implicit regularizer, biasing the model toward these simpler classes. These results provide a theoretical foundation for the emergence of staged learning and complex behaviors in transformers, offering insights into generalization for natural language processing and algorithmic reasoning.

TL;DR: ARTIST通过选择性数据使用提高了时间序列推理的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列推理任务通常从自然语言问题开始，需要对时间序列进行针对性的分析。证据可能跨越整个序列或出现在几个短间隔中，因此模型必须决定要检查什么。大多数现有方法在推理之前将整个时间序列编码为固定的表示，无论整个序列是否相关。

Method: ARTIST将时间序列推理定义为序列决策问题。ARTIST将推理与自适应时间段选择交织在一起。它采用控制器-推理器架构，并使用强化学习来训练控制器角色选择信息段，推理器角色生成段条件推理轨迹和最终答案。在推理过程中，模型积极获取与任务相关的信息，而不是依赖于整个序列的静态摘要。使用新颖的分层策略优化方法进行后训练，使模型在段选择和问答行为方面都表现出色。

Result: 在六个时间序列推理基准上评估ARTIST，并将其与大型语言模型、视觉语言模型和先前的时间序列推理系统进行比较。ARTIST将平均准确率提高了6.46个绝对百分点。最大的收益出现在稀有事件定位和多段推理任务上。监督微调提高了性能，强化学习通过优化问题自适应段选择提供了额外的收益。这些结果表明，选择性数据使用推动了有效的时间序列推理。

Conclusion: ARTIST通过选择性数据使用提高了时间序列推理的有效性。

Abstract: Time series reasoning tasks often start with a natural language question and require targeted analysis of a time series. Evidence may span the full series or appear in a few short intervals, so the model must decide what to inspect. Most existing approaches encode the entire time series into a fixed representation before inference, regardless of whether or not the entire sequence is relevant. We introduce ARTIST, which formulates time-series reasoning as a sequential decision problem. ARTIST interleaves reasoning with adaptive temporal segment selection. It adopts a controller-reasoner architecture and uses reinforcement learning to train the controller role to select informative segments and the reasoner role to generate segment-conditioned reasoning traces and final answers. During inference, the model actively acquires task-relevant information instead of relying on a static summary of the full sequence. We use a novel hierarchical policy optimization approach for post-training that allows the model to excel in both segment selection and question-answering behavior. We evaluate ARTIST on six time-series reasoning benchmarks and compare it with large language models, vision-language models, and prior time-series reasoning systems. ARTIST improves average accuracy by 6.46 absolute percentage points over the strongest baseline. The largest gains appear on rare event localization and multi-segment reasoning tasks. Supervised fine-tuning improves performance, and reinforcement learning provides additional gains by optimizing question-adaptive segment selection. These results show that selective data use drives effective time-series reasoning.

Motivation: Representational similarity metrics在神经表征中容易受到噪声和异常值的影响。

Method: 将软匹配距离扩展到部分最优传输设置，允许一些神经元保持不匹配。

Result: 在模拟和fMRI数据上，这种方法在异常值和噪声中保持正确的匹配，并产生与计算成本高昂的穷举法相匹配的体素排名。

Conclusion: 部分软匹配为在部分对应关系下进行表征比较提供了一种原则性和实用性的方法。

Abstract: Representational similarity metrics typically force all units to be matched, making them susceptible to noise and outliers common in neural representations. We extend the soft-matching distance to a partial optimal transport setting that allows some neurons to remain unmatched, yielding rotation-sensitive but robust correspondences. This partial soft-matching distance provides theoretical advantages -- relaxing strict mass conservation while maintaining interpretable transport costs -- and practical benefits through efficient neuron ranking in terms of cross-network alignment without costly iterative recomputation. In simulations, it preserves correct matches under outliers and reliably selects the correct model in noise-corrupted identification tasks. On fMRI data, it automatically excludes low-reliability voxels and produces voxel rankings by alignment quality that closely match computationally expensive brute-force approaches. It achieves higher alignment precision across homologous brain areas than standard soft-matching, which is forced to match all units regardless of quality. In deep networks, highly matched units exhibit similar maximally exciting images, while unmatched units show divergent patterns. This ability to partition by match quality enables focused analyses, e.g., testing whether networks have privileged axes even within their most aligned subpopulations. Overall, partial soft-matching provides a principled and practical method for representational comparison under partial correspondence.

Method: 使用条件熵率作为识别现有噪声级别分配中子优化的理论依据，并引入InfoNoise，一种基于信息引导的噪声采样分布。

Result: 在自然图像基准测试中，InfoNoise与调优的EDM式调度相当或更好，某些情况下训练速度提高约1.4倍。在离散数据集中，它在不到3倍的训练步骤中达到更优质量。

Conclusion: InfoNoise使噪声调度数据自适应，减少了对每个数据集设计调度的需求，随着扩散模型在各个领域扩展，这一优势更加明显。

Abstract: Training diffusion models typically relies on manually tuned noise schedules, which can waste computation on weakly informative noise regions and limit transfer across datasets, resolutions, and representations. We revisit noise schedule allocation through an information-theoretic lens and propose the conditional entropy rate of the forward process as a theoretically grounded, data-dependent diagnostic for identifying suboptimal noise-level allocation in existing schedules. Based on these insight, we introduce InfoNoise, a principled data-adaptive training noise schedule that replaces heuristic schedule design with an information-guided noise sampling distribution derived from entropy-reduction rates estimated from denoising losses already computed during training. Across natural-image benchmarks, InfoNoise matches or surpasses tuned EDM-style schedules, in some cases with a substantial training speedup (about $1.4\times$ on CIFAR-10). On discrete datasets, where standard image-tuned schedules exhibit significant mismatch, it reaches superior quality in up to $3\times$ fewer training steps. Overall, InfoNoise makes noise scheduling data-adaptive, reducing the need for per-dataset schedule design as diffusion models expand across domains.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在时间序列诊断推理方面取得了显著的成果，为解决现有解决方案的不足提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Time-series diagnostic reasoning is essential for many applications, yet existing solutions face a persistent gap: general reasoning large language models (GRLMs) possess strong reasoning skills but lack the domain-specific knowledge to understand complex time-series patterns. Conversely, fine-tuned time-series LLMs (TSLMs) understand these patterns but lack the capacity to generalize reasoning for more complicated questions. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid knowledge-injection framework that injects TSLM-generated insights directly into GRLM's reasoning trace, thereby achieving strong time-series reasoning with in-domain knowledge. As collecting data for knowledge injection fine-tuning is costly, we further leverage a reinforcement learning-based approach with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit knowledge-rich traces without human supervision, then transfer such an in-domain thinking trace into GRLM for efficient knowledge injection. We further release SenTSR-Bench, a multivariate time-series-based diagnostic reasoning benchmark collected from real-world industrial operations. Across SenTSR-Bench and other public datasets, our method consistently surpasses TSLMs by 9.1%-26.1% and GRLMs by 7.9%-22.4%, delivering robust, context-aware time-series diagnostic insights.

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，Potara在提高个性化的同时减少了通信，实现了强大的性能-通信权衡。

Conclusion: Potara是一种有效的联邦个性化框架，通过理论化的方法提高了性能并降低了通信成本。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as LoRA, offer a practical way to adapt large vision and language models to client tasks. However, this becomes particularly challenging under task-level heterogeneity in federated deployments. In this regime, personalization requires balancing general knowledge with personalized knowledge, yet existing approaches largely rely on heuristic mixing rules and lack theoretical justification. Moreover, prior model merging approaches are also computation and communication intensive, making the process inefficient in federated settings. In this work, we propose Potara, a principled framework for federated personalization that constructs a personalized model for each client by merging two complementary models: (i) a federated model capturing general knowledge, and (ii) a local model capturing personalized knowledge. Through the construct of linear mode connectivity, we show that the expected task loss admits a variance trace upper bound, whose minimization yields closed-form optimal mixing weights that guarantee a tighter bound for the merged model than for either the federated or local model alone. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that Potara consistently improves personalization while reducing communication, leading to a strong performance-communication trade-off.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal discovery for both cross-sectional and temporal data has traditionally followed a dataset-specific paradigm, where a new model is fitted for each individual dataset. This approach limits the potential of multi-dataset pretraining.

Method: Propose a principled framework for LCMs, combining diverse synthetic generators with realistic time-series datasets, allowing learning at scale.

Such an approach limits the potential of multi-dataset pretraining. The concept of large causal models (LCMs) envisions a class of pre-trained neural architectures specifically designed for temporal causal discovery. Prior approaches are constrained to small variable counts, degrade with larger inputs, and rely heavily on synthetic data, limiting generalization. We propose a principled framework for LCMs, combining diverse synthetic generators with realistic time-series datasets, allowing learning at scale. Extensive experiments on synthetic, semi-synthetic and realistic benchmarks show that LCMs scale effectively to higher variable counts and deeper architectures while maintaining strong performance. Trained models achieve competitive or superior accuracy compared to classical and neural baselines, particularly in out-of-distribution settings, while enabling fast, single-pass inference. Results demonstrate LCMs as a promising foundation-model paradigm for temporal causal discovery. Experiments and model weights are available at https://github.com/kougioulis/LCM-paper/.

Result: 分析了有限内循环步骤T下的数据混合收敛行为，证明了贪心方法可能失败，并确定了最优T的规模。

Conclusion: 对数据混合问题进行了深入的理论分析，为实际应用提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Data mixing--the strategic reweighting of training domains--is a critical component in training robust machine learning models. This problem is naturally formulated as a bilevel optimization task, where the outer loop optimizes domain weights to minimize validation loss, and the inner loop optimizes model parameters to minimize the weighted training loss. Classical bilevel optimization relies on hypergradients, which theoretically require the inner optimization to reach convergence. However, due to computational constraints, state-of-the-art methods use a finite, often small, number of inner update steps before updating the weights. The theoretical implications of this approximation are not well understood. In this work, we rigorously analyze the convergence behavior of data mixing with a finite number of inner steps $T$. We prove that the "greedy" practical approach of using $T=1$ can fail even in a simple quadratic example. Under a fixed parameter update budget $N$ and assuming the per-domain losses are strongly convex, we show that the optimal $T$ scales as $Θ(\log N)$ (resp., $Θ({(N \log N)}^{1/2})$) for the data mixing problem with access to full (resp., stochastic) gradients. We complement our theoretical results with proof-of-concept experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估交通安全中的事故分类模型，通常使用准确率、F1或AUC等指标，这些指标无法揭示模型是否在静默中过拟合。

Method: 提出了一种基于随机矩阵理论（RMT）和重尾自正则化（HTSR）的频谱诊断框架，涵盖了机器学习分类法中的各种模型，包括BERT/ALBERT/Qwen2.5的权重矩阵、XGBoost/随机森林的折叠外增量矩阵、逻辑回归的经验Hessian、决策树的诱导亲和矩阵和KNN的图拉普拉斯矩阵。在两个爱荷华州交通局的事故分类任务上评估了九个模型家族。

Result: 发现功率律指数α提供了结构质量信号：良好正则化的模型α值始终在[2, 4]范围内（平均值2.87 ± 0.34），而过拟合的变体α值小于2或频谱崩溃。α与专家一致性强相关（斯皮尔曼ρ=0.89，p < 0.001），表明频谱质量捕获了与专家推理一致的行为。提出了基于α的早期停止准则和频谱模型选择协议，并验证了两者与交叉验证F1基线。稀疏Lanczos逼近使框架可扩展到大型数据集。

Conclusion: 频谱质量可以捕捉模型行为，与专家推理一致，并可用于早期停止和模型选择。

Abstract: Crash classification models in transportation safety are typically evaluated using accuracy, F1, or AUC, metrics that cannot reveal whether a model is silently overfitting. We introduce a spectral diagnostic framework grounded in Random Matrix Theory (RMT) and Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR) that spans the ML taxonomy: weight matrices for BERT/ALBERT/Qwen2.5, out-of-fold increment matrices for XGBoost/Random Forest, empirical Hessians for Logistic Regression, induced affinity matrices for Decision Trees, and Graph Laplacians for KNN. Evaluating nine model families on two Iowa DOT crash classification tasks (173,512 and 371,062 records respectively), we find that the power-law exponent $α$ provides a structural quality signal: well-regularized models consistently yield $α$ within $[2, 4]$ (mean $2.87 \pm 0.34$), while overfit variants show $α< 2$ or spectral collapse. We observe a strong rank correlation between $α$ and expert agreement (Spearman $ρ= 0.89$, $p < 0.001$), suggesting spectral quality captures model behaviors aligned with expert reasoning. We propose an $α$-based early stopping criterion and a spectral model selection protocol, and validate both against cross-validated F1 baselines. Sparse Lanczos approximations make the framework scalable to large datasets.

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models for scientific machine learning adapt to physical settings unseen during training, such as zero-shot transfer between turbulent scales. This phenomenon, in-context learning, challenges conventional understanding of learning and adaptation in physical systems. Here, we study in-context learning of dynamical systems in a minimal setting: we train a small two-layer, single-head transformer to forecast one dynamical system, and then evaluate its ability to forecast a different dynamical system without retraining. We discover an early tradeoff in training between in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance, which manifests as a secondary double descent phenomenon. We discover that attention-based models apply a transfer-operator forecasting strategy in-context. They (1) lift low-dimensional time series using delay embedding, to detect the system's higher-dimensional dynamical manifold, and (2) identify and forecast long-lived invariant sets that characterize the global flow on this manifold. Our results clarify the mechanism enabling large pretrained models to forecast unseen physical systems at test without retraining, and they illustrate the unique ability of attention-based models to leverage global attractor information in service of short-term forecasts.

Abstract: We develop a Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference (CAVI) algorithm for Bayesian Mixed Data Sampling (MIDAS) regression with linear weight parameteri zations. The model separates impact coe cients from weighting function parameters through a normalization constraint, creating a bilinear structure that renders generic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers unreliable while preserving conditional conju gacy exploitable by CAVI. Each variational update admits a closed-form solution: Gaussian for regression coe cients and weight parameters, Inverse-Gamma for the error variance. The algorithm propagates uncertainty across blocks through second moments, distinguishing it from naive plug-in approximations. In a Monte Carlo study spanning 21 data-generating con gurations with up to 50 predictors, CAVI produces posterior means nearly identical to a block Gibbs sampler benchmark while achieving speedups of 107x to 1,772x (Table 9). Generic automatic di eren tiation VI (ADVI), by contrast, produces bias 714 times larger while being orders of magnitude slower, con rming the value of model-speci c derivations. Weight function parameters maintain excellent calibration (coverage above 92%) across all con gurations. Impact coe cient credible intervals exhibit the underdispersion characteristic of mean- eld approximations, with coverage declining from 89% to 55% as the number of predictors grows a documented trade-o between speed and interval calibration that structured variational methods can address. An empirical application to realized volatility forecasting on S&P 500 daily returns con rms that CAVI and Gibbs sampling yield virtually identical point forecasts, with CAVI completing each monthly estimation in under 10 milliseconds.

TL;DR: I-TAP provides an efficient and robust solution for in-context planning in continuous control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous control in reinforcement learning faces challenges due to planning at primitive time scales, long horizons, and non-stationary environments.

Method: I-TAP, an offline RL framework that combines in-context adaptation and online planning in a learned discrete temporal-abstraction space.

Result: I-TAP achieves efficient and robust in-context planning under stochastic dynamics and partial observability, outperforming strong baselines in various MuJoCo and Adroit manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: I-TAP demonstrates the effectiveness of in-context planning in continuous control tasks.

Abstract: Planning-based reinforcement learning for continuous control is bottlenecked by two practical issues: planning at primitive time scales leads to prohibitive branching and long horizons, while real environments are frequently partially observable and exhibit regime shifts that invalidate stationary, fully observed dynamics assumptions. We introduce I-TAP (In-Context Latent Temporal-Abstraction Planner), an offline RL framework that unifies in-context adaptation with online planning in a learned discrete temporal-abstraction space. From offline trajectories, I-TAP learns an observation-conditioned residual-quantization VAE that compresses each observation-macro-action segment into a coarse-to-fine stack of discrete residual tokens, and a temporal Transformer that autoregressively predicts these token stacks from a short recent history. The resulting sequence model acts simultaneously as a context-conditioned prior over abstract actions and a latent dynamics model. At test time, I-TAP performs Monte Carlo Tree Search directly in token space, using short histories for implicit adaptation without gradient update, and decodes selected token stacks into executable actions. Across deterministic MuJoCo, stochastic MuJoCo with per-episode latent dynamics regimes, and high-dimensional Adroit manipulation, including partially observable variants, I-TAP consistently matches or outperforms strong model-free and model-based offline baselines, demonstrating efficient and robust in-context planning under stochastic dynamics and partial observability.

Conclusion: 跳跃世界模型在组合规划中提高了长期预测准确性，显著提升了操作和导航任务的性能。

Abstract: The ability to plan with temporal abstractions is central to intelligent decision-making. Rather than reasoning over primitive actions, we study agents that compose pre-trained policies as temporally extended actions, enabling solutions to complex tasks that no constituent alone can solve. Such compositional planning remains elusive as compounding errors in long-horizon predictions make it challenging to estimate the visitation distribution induced by sequencing policies. Motivated by the geometric policy composition framework introduced in arXiv:2206.08736, we address these challenges by learning predictive models of multi-step dynamics -- so-called jumpy world models -- that capture state occupancies induced by pre-trained policies across multiple timescales in an off-policy manner. Building on Temporal Difference Flows (arXiv:2503.09817), we enhance these models with a novel consistency objective that aligns predictions across timescales, improving long-horizon predictive accuracy. We further demonstrate how to combine these generative predictions to estimate the value of executing arbitrary sequences of policies over varying timescales. Empirically, we find that compositional planning with jumpy world models significantly improves zero-shot performance across a wide range of base policies on challenging manipulation and navigation tasks, yielding, on average, a 200% relative improvement over planning with primitive actions on long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: 将可训练的顺序动力学纳入插入模型可以提高生成质量，并有助于解决学习挑战。

Abstract: In many domains generating variable length sequences through insertions provides greater flexibility over autoregressive models. However, the action space of insertion models is much larger than that of autoregressive models (ARMs) making the learning challenging. To address this, we incorporate trainable order dynamics into the target rates for discrete flow matching, and show that with suitable choices of parameterizations, joint training of the target order dynamics and the generator is tractable without the need for numerical simulation. As the generative insertion model, we use a variable length masked diffusion model, which generates by inserting and filling mask tokens. On graph traversal tasks for which a locally optimal insertion order is known, we explore the choices of parameterization empirically and demonstrate the trade-offs between flexibility, training stability and generation quality. On de novo small molecule generation, we find that the learned order dynamics leads to an increase in the number of valid molecules generated and improved quality, when compared to uniform order dynamics.

Abstract: Concept drift -- the change of the distribution over time -- poses significant challenges for learning systems and is of central interest for monitoring. Understanding drift is thus paramount, and drift localization -- determining which samples are affected by the drift -- is essential. While several approaches exist, most rely on local testing schemes, which tend to fail in high-dimensional, low-signal settings. In this work, we consider a fundamentally different approach based on conformal predictions. We discuss and show the shortcomings of common approaches and demonstrate the performance of our approach on state-of-the-art image datasets.

TL;DR: 先验感知记忆为评估LLMs中的数据泄露提供了一种有效的方法，有助于区分真正的记忆和统计上的常见性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练数据泄露对大型语言模型（LLMs）的隐私、安全和版权合规性提出严重担忧。评估此风险的一个主要挑战是区分对训练数据的真正记忆与统计上常见的序列生成。现有的测量记忆的方法往往混淆这些现象，即使输出源于对常见模式的泛化，也将其标记为记忆。反事实记忆提供了一种原则性的解决方案，通过比较带有和没有目标序列的训练的模型，但其依赖于重新训练多个基线模型，这使得它在规模上既昂贵又不切实际。

Method: 提出了一种名为“先验感知记忆”的新方法，该方法是一种理论上扎根、轻量级且无需训练的准则，用于识别LLMs中的真正记忆。关键思想是评估候选后缀是否与其特定的训练前缀有很强的关联，或者它是否由于统计上的共同性而具有很高的概率出现在许多无关的提示中。在两个预训练模型LLaMA和OPT的训练语料库文本上评估此指标，使用长序列（模拟版权风险）和命名实体（模拟PII泄露）。

Result: 结果显示，55%至90%的先前标记为记忆的序列实际上是统计上常见的。在SATML训练数据提取挑战数据集上也有类似发现，其中约40%的序列表现出常见模式的行为，尽管它们在训练数据中只出现一次。这些结果表明，低频率本身不足以成为记忆的证据，并强调了在评估泄露时考虑模型先验的重要性。

Conclusion: 先验感知记忆为评估LLMs中的数据泄露提供了一种有效的方法，有助于区分真正的记忆和统计上的常见性。

Abstract: Training data leakage from Large Language Models (LLMs) raises serious concerns related to privacy, security, and copyright compliance. A central challenge in assessing this risk is distinguishing genuine memorization of training data from the generation of statistically common sequences. Existing approaches to measuring memorization often conflate these phenomena, labeling outputs as memorized even when they arise from generalization over common patterns. Counterfactual Memorization provides a principled solution by comparing models trained with and without a target sequence, but its reliance on retraining multiple baseline models makes it computationally expensive and impractical at scale.
  This work introduces Prior-Aware Memorization, a theoretically grounded, lightweight and training-free criterion for identifying genuine memorization in LLMs. The key idea is to evaluate whether a candidate suffix is strongly associated with its specific training prefix or whether it appears with high probability across many unrelated prompts due to statistical commonality.
  We evaluate this metric on text from the training corpora of two pre-trained models, LLaMA and OPT, using both long sequences (to simulate copyright risks) and named entities (to simulate PII leakage). Our results show that between 55% and 90% of sequences previously labeled as memorized are in fact statistically common. Similar findings hold for the SATML training data extraction challenge dataset, where roughly 40% of sequences exhibit common-pattern behavior despite appearing only once in the training data. These results demonstrate that low frequency alone is insufficient evidence of memorization and highlight the importance of accounting for model priors when assessing leakage.

Motivation: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) threaten the privacy of machine learning models by revealing whether a specific data point was used during training.

Method: Propose a cost-effective label-only MIA framework based on transferability and model extraction. Query the target model using active sampling, perturbation-based selection, and synthetic data. Extract a functionally similar surrogate model on which membership inference is performed.

Result: Significantly reduce query costs while maintaining the performance of state-of-the-art label-only MIAs. Achieve membership inference accuracy within ±1% of the target model on benchmarks. Evaluate the effectiveness of standard defenses against the proposed attack.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates MIA threats while being cost-effective and practical.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) threaten the privacy of machine learning models by revealing whether a specific data point was used during training. Existing MIAs often rely on impractical assumptions such as access to public datasets, shadow models, confidence scores, or training data distribution knowledge and making them vulnerable to defenses like confidence masking and adversarial regularization. Label-only MIAs, even under strict constraints suffer from high query requirements per sample. We propose a cost-effective label-only MIA framework based on transferability and model extraction. By querying the target model M using active sampling, perturbation-based selection, and synthetic data, we extract a functionally similar surrogate S on which membership inference is performed. This shifts query overhead to a one-time extraction phase, eliminating repeated queries to M . Operating under strict black-box constraints, our method matches the performance of state-of-the-art label-only MIAs while significantly reducing query costs. On benchmarks including Purchase, Location, and Texas Hospital, we show that a query budget equivalent to testing $\approx1\%$ of training samples suffices to extract S and achieve membership inference accuracy within $\pm1\%$ of M . We also evaluate the effectiveness of standard defenses proposed for label-only MIAs against our attack.

Abstract: We present a family of generalized Hessian estimators of the objective using random direction stochastic approximation (RDSA) by utilizing only noisy function measurements. The form of each estimator and the order of the bias depend on the number of function measurements. In particular, we demonstrate that estimators with more function measurements exhibit lower-order estimation bias. We show the asymptotic unbiasedness of the estimators. We also perform asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence analyses for stochastic Newton methods that incorporate our generalized Hessian estimators. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to validate our theoretical findings.

Conclusion: 该研究首次揭示了生成式世界模型的安全漏洞，并量化了其风险。

Abstract: Generative world models (WMs) are increasingly used to synthesize controllable, sensor-conditioned driving videos, yet their reliance on physical priors exposes novel attack surfaces. In this paper, we present Physical-Conditioned World Model Attack (PhysCond-WMA), the first white-box world model attack that perturbs physical-condition channels, such as HDMap embeddings and 3D-box features, to induce semantic, logic, or decision-level distortion while preserving perceptual fidelity. PhysCond-WMA is optimized in two stages: (1) a quality-preserving guidance stage that constrains reverse-diffusion loss below a calibrated threshold, and (2) a momentum-guided denoising stage that accumulates target-aligned gradients along the denoising trajectory for stable, temporally coherent semantic shifts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach remains effective while increasing FID by about 9% on average and FVD by about 3.9% on average. Under the targeted attack setting, the attack success rate (ASR) reaches 0.55. Downstream studies further show tangible risk, which using attacked videos for training decreases 3D detection performance by about 4%, and worsens open-loop planning performance by about 20%. These findings has for the first time revealed and quantified security vulnerabilities in generative world models, driving more comprehensive security checkers.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) approaches, enabling parallel token generation beyond a rigid left-to-right order. Despite growing empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how unmasking schedules -- which specify the order and size of unmasked tokens during sampling -- affect generation quality remains limited. In this work, we introduce a distribution-agnostic unmasking schedule for DLMs that adapts to the (unknown) dependence structure of the target data distribution, without requiring any prior knowledge or hyperparameter tuning. In contrast to prior deterministic procedures that fix unmasking sizes, our method randomizes the number of tokens revealed at each iteration. We show that, for two specific parameter choices, the sampling convergence guarantees -- measured by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence -- scale as $\widetilde O(\mathsf{TC}/K)$ and $\widetilde O(\mathsf{DTC}/K)$ respectively. Here, $K$ is the number of iterations, and $\mathsf{TC}$ and $\mathsf{DTC}$ are the total correlation and dual total correlation of the target distribution, capturing the intrinsic dependence structure underlying the data. Importantly, our guarantees hold in the practically relevant parallel-sampling regime $K<L$ where $L$ is the token sequence length. These results significantly improve upon prior convergence theories and yield substantial sampling acceleration for low-complexity distributions. Overall, our findings unveil the adaptivity of DLMs to intrinsic data structures and shed light on the benefit of randomized unmasking sizes in inference schedule design.

Abstract: Inspired by behavioral science, we propose Behavior Learning (BL), a novel general-purpose machine learning framework that learns interpretable and identifiable optimization structures from data, ranging from single optimization problems to hierarchical compositions. It unifies predictive performance, intrinsic interpretability, and identifiability, with broad applicability to scientific domains involving optimization. BL parameterizes a compositional utility function built from intrinsically interpretable modular blocks, which induces a data distribution for prediction and generation. Each block represents and can be written in symbolic form as a utility maximization problem (UMP), a foundational paradigm in behavioral science and a universal framework of optimization. BL supports architectures ranging from a single UMP to hierarchical compositions, the latter modeling hierarchical optimization structures. Its smooth and monotone variant (IBL) guarantees identifiability. Theoretically, we establish the universal approximation property of BL, and analyze the M-estimation properties of IBL. Empirically, BL demonstrates strong predictive performance, intrinsic interpretability and scalability to high-dimensional data.

Conclusion: CaliCausalRank框架有效优化了多个目标指标，提高了排序系统的性能。

Abstract: Ad ranking systems must simultaneously optimize multiple objectives including click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate (CVR), revenue, and user experience metrics. However, production systems face critical challenges: score scale inconsistency across traffic segments undermines threshold transferability, and position bias in click logs causes offline-online metric discrepancies. We propose CaliCausalRank, a unified framework that integrates training-time scale calibration, constraint-based multi-objective optimization, and robust counterfactual utility estimation. Our approach treats score calibration as a first-class training objective rather than post-hoc processing, employs Lagrangian relaxation for constraint satisfaction, and utilizes variance-reduced counterfactual estimators for reliable offline evaluation. Experiments on the Criteo and Avazu datasets demonstrate that CaliCausalRank achieves 1.1% relative AUC improvement, 31.6% calibration error reduction, and 3.2% utility gain compared to the best baseline (PairRank) while maintaining consistent performance across different traffic segments.

Conclusion: ARC和ARC_zero是有效的通用GAD方法，在少样本和零样本设置下具有强大的泛化能力和高效性。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is critical for identifying abnormal nodes in graph-structured data from diverse domains, including cybersecurity and social networks. The existing GAD methods often focus on the learning paradigms of "one-model-for-one-dataset", requiring dataset-specific training for each dataset to achieve optimal performance. However, this paradigm suffers from significant limitations, such as high computational and data costs, limited generalization and transferability to new datasets, and challenges in privacy-sensitive scenarios where access to full datasets or sufficient labels is restricted. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generalist GAD paradigm that aims to develop a unified model capable of detecting anomalies on multiple unseen datasets without extensive retraining/fine-tuning or dataset-specific customization. To this end, we propose ARC, a few-shot generalist GAD method that leverages in-context learning and requires only a few labeled normal samples at inference time. Specifically, ARC consists of three core modules: a feature Alignment module to unify and align features across datasets, a Residual GNN encoder to capture dataset-agnostic anomaly representations, and a cross-attentive in-Context learning module to score anomalies using few-shot normal context. Building on ARC, we further introduce ARC_zero for the zero-shot generalist GAD setting, which selects representative pseudo-normal nodes via a pseudo-context mechanism and thus enables fully label-free inference on unseen datasets. Extensive experiments on 17 real-world graph datasets demonstrate that both ARC and ARC_zero effectively detect anomalies, exhibit strong generalization ability, and perform efficiently under few-shot and zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Despite powering modern AI, transformers remain mysteriously brittle to train. We develop a stability theory that explains why pre-LayerNorm works, why DeepNorm uses $N^{-1/4}$ scaling, and why warmup is necessary, all from first principles. Our framework has two pillars: (1) We derive the \emph{exact} operator norm of the softmax Jacobian, $\|J_{softmax}(u/τ)\|_{\infty\to 1} = θ(p)/τ$, where the balanced-mass factor $θ(p)\in[0,1]$ quantifies attention sensitivity. (2) We introduce a block-$\infty$/RMS geometry aligned with tokenwise computation, yielding Lipschitz bounds independent of sequence length. Using this framework, we prove that pre-LN preserves identity gradient paths while post-LN compounds LayerNorm Jacobians exponentially with depth, and we show that DeepNorm's $N^{-1/4}$ emerges from the quartic structure of attention's four projection matrices. We validate our theory on 774M-parameter models and find that, contrary to the intuition that attention sharpens during training to reduce sensitivity, $θ(p) \approx 1$ persists throughout. Transformer stability arises entirely from architectural gradient flow, not from attention dynamics. This finding changes how we reason about training: the architecture itself must handle sensitivity, not learned attention patterns.

Motivation: 分析transformer中注意力分数的溢出风险，并推导出一个秩感知的集中不等式。

Method: 推导秩感知的集中不等式，并将其应用于FP8训练，提出了一种几何感知的缩放因子。

Result: 几何感知缩放消除了延迟缩放失败的瞬态场景中的溢出，同时达到了可比的下游MMLU准确率。

Conclusion: 该研究通过引入秩感知的集中不等式和几何感知缩放，有效地降低了transformer在低精度训练中的溢出风险。

Abstract: Attention scores in transformers are bilinear forms $S_{ij} = x_i^\top M x_j / \sqrt{d_h}$ whose maximum magnitude governs overflow risk in low-precision training. We derive a \emph{rank-aware concentration inequality}: when the interaction matrix $M = W^Q W^{K\top}$ has rank $r \ll d$, tail probabilities for $\max_{i,j}|S_{ij}|$ decay as $\exp(-d^{2}α^{2}/(γr))$ rather than $\exp(-dα^{2})$, where $γ> 1$ is a typicality parameter. For transformer attention where $r = d_h$, this yields $8$--$28\times$ tighter concentration than rank-agnostic bounds in modern architectures. We apply this result to FP8 training, deriving \emph{geometry-aware scale factors} that provide principled overflow guarantees without observing activations. The method computes per-layer scales from the spectral norm $\|W^Q W^{K\top}\|_2$ via implicit power iteration, includes a grouped query attention formulation that avoids key expansion, and remains compatible with fused attention kernels. Across GPT-2 XL to Llama-2-70B, geometry-aware scaling eliminates overflows in transient scenarios where delayed scaling fails, while achieving comparable downstream MMLU accuracy.

Conclusion: 需要开发新的指标来更可靠地捕捉非表格RL中的任务复杂度。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled major advances in fields such as robotics and natural language processing. A key challenge in RL is measuring task complexity, which is essential for creating meaningful benchmarks and designing effective curricula. While there are numerous well-established metrics for assessing task complexity in tabular settings, relatively few exist in non-tabular domains. These include (i) Statistical analysis of the performance of random policies via Random Weight Guessing (RWG), and (ii) information-theoretic metrics Policy Information Capacity (PIC) and Policy-Optimal Information Capacity (POIC), which are reliant on RWG. In this paper, we evaluate these methods using progressively difficult robotic manipulation setups, with known relative complexity, with both dense and sparse reward formulations. Our empirical results reveal that measuring complexity is still nuanced. Specifically, under the same reward formulation, PIC suggests that a two-link robotic arm setup is easier than a single-link setup - which contradicts the robotic control and empirical RL perspective whereby the two-link setup is inherently more complex. Likewise, for the same setup, POIC estimates that tasks with sparse rewards are easier than those with dense rewards. Thus, we show that both PIC and POIC contradict typical understanding and empirical results from RL. These findings highlight the need to move beyond RWG-based metrics towards better metrics that can more reliably capture task complexity in non-tabular RL with our task framework as a starting point.

Abstract: Optimally trading-off exploration and exploitation is the holy grail of reinforcement learning as it promises maximal data-efficiency for solving any task. Bayes-optimal agents achieve this, but obtaining the belief-state and performing planning are both typically intractable. Although deep learning methods can greatly help in scaling this computation, existing methods are still costly to train. To accelerate this, this paper proposes a variational framework for learning and planning in Bayes-adaptive Markov decision processes that coalesces variational belief learning, sequential Monte-Carlo planning, and meta-reinforcement learning. In a single-GPU setup, our new method VariBASeD exhibits favorable scaling to larger planning budgets, improving sample- and runtime-efficiency over prior methods.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph(KG) has gained traction as a machine-readable organization of real-world knowledge for analytics using artificial intelligence systems. Graph Neural Network(GNN), is proven to be an effective KG embedding technique that enables various downstream tasks like link prediction, node classification, and graph classification. The focus of research in both KG embedding and GNNs has been mostly oriented towards simple graphs with binary relations. However, real-world knowledge bases have a significant share of complex and n-ary facts that cannot be represented by binary edges. More specifically, real-world knowledge bases are often a mix of two types of n-ary facts - (i) that require hyperedges and (ii) that require hyper-relational edges. Though there are research efforts catering to these n-ary fact types, they are pursued independently for each type. We propose $H$yper$E$dge $H$yper-$R$elational edge $GNN$(HEHRGNN), a unified embedding model for n-ary relational KGs with both hyperedges and hyper-relational edges. The two main components of the model are i)HEHR unified fact representation format, and ii)HEHRGNN encoder, a GNN-based encoder with a novel message propagation model capable of capturing complex graph structures comprising both hyperedges and hyper-relational edges. The experimental results of HEHRGNN on link prediction tasks show its effectiveness as a unified embedding model, with inductive prediction capability, for link prediction across real-world datasets having different types of n-ary facts. The model also shows improved link prediction performance over baseline models for hyperedge and hyper-relational datasets.

Abstract: Vector-quantized autoencoders deliver high-fidelity latents but suffer inherent flaws: the quantizer is non-differentiable, requires straight-through hacks, and is prone to collapse. We address these issues at the root by replacing VQ with a simple, principled, and fully differentiable alternative: an online PCA bottleneck trained via Oja's rule. The resulting model, PCA-VAE, learns an orthogonal, variance-ordered latent basis without codebooks, commitment losses, or lookup noise. Despite its simplicity, PCA-VAE exceeds VQ-GAN and SimVQ in reconstruction quality on CelebAHQ while using 10-100x fewer latent bits. It also produces naturally interpretable dimensions (e.g., pose, lighting, gender cues) without adversarial regularization or disentanglement objectives. These results suggest that PCA is a viable replacement for VQ: mathematically grounded, stable, bit-efficient, and semantically structured, offering a new direction for generative models beyond vector quantization.

Conclusion: TRUE框架为提高LLM推理系统的可解释性和可靠性提供了一种统一和原则性的范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, yet their decision-making processes remain difficult to interpret. Existing explanation methods often lack trustworthy structural insight and are limited to single-instance analysis, failing to reveal reasoning stability and systematic failure mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose the Trustworthy Unified Explanation Framework (TRUE), which integrates executable reasoning verification, feasible-region directed acyclic graph (DAG) modeling, and causal failure mode analysis. At the instance level, we redefine reasoning traces as executable process specifications and introduce blind execution verification to assess operational validity. At the local structural level, we construct feasible-region DAGs via structure-consistent perturbations, enabling explicit characterization of reasoning stability and the executable region in the local input space. At the class level, we introduce a causal failure mode analysis method that identifies recurring structural failure patterns and quantifies their causal influence using Shapley values. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework provides multi-level, verifiable explanations, including executable reasoning structures for individual instances, feasible-region representations for neighboring inputs, and interpretable failure modes with quantified importance at the class level. These results establish a unified and principled paradigm for improving the interpretability and reliability of LLM reasoning systems.

TL;DR: DeepInterestGR improves recommendation frameworks by addressing the Shallow Interest problem through innovative methods and achieves superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent generative recommendation frameworks primarily rely on shallow behavioral signals, leading to a Shallow Interest problem.

Method: DeepInterestGR introduces three key innovations: Multi-LLM Interest Mining, Reward-Labeled Deep Interest, and Interest-Enhanced Item Discretization. A two-stage training pipeline is adopted.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that DeepInterestGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across HR@K and NDCG@K metrics.

Conclusion: DeepInterestGR effectively captures user interests and improves recommendation performance.

Abstract: Recent generative recommendation frameworks have demonstrated remarkable scaling potential by reformulating item prediction as autoregressive Semantic ID (SID) generation. However, existing methods primarily rely on shallow behavioral signals, encoding items solely through surface-level textual features such as titles and descriptions. This reliance results in a critical Shallow Interest problem: the model fails to capture the latent, semantically rich interests underlying user interactions, limiting both personalization depth and recommendation interpretability. DeepInterestGR introduces three key innovations: (1) Multi-LLM Interest Mining (MLIM): We leverage multiple frontier LLMs along with their multi-modal variants to extract deep textual and visual interest representations through Chain-of-Thought prompting. (2) Reward-Labeled Deep Interest (RLDI): We employ a lightweight binary classifier to assign reward labels to mined interests, enabling effective supervision signals for reinforcement learning. (3) Interest-Enhanced Item Discretization (IEID): The curated deep interests are encoded into semantic embeddings and quantized into SID tokens via RQ-VAE. We adopt a two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning aligns the generative model with deep interest signals and collaborative filtering patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with GRPO optimized by our Interest-Aware Reward. Experiments on three Amazon Review benchmarks demonstrate that DeepInterestGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across HR@K and NDCG@K metrics.

Conclusion: 提出的SLDP框架有效地降低了隐私预算成本，并提高了高分辨率网格的使用效率，为高效用隐私保护分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Density-adaptive domain discretization is essential for high-utility privacy-preserving analytics but remains challenging under Local Differential Privacy (LDP) due to the privacy-budget costs associated with iterative refinement. We propose a novel framework, Semi-Local Differential Privacy (SLDP), that assigns a privacy region to each user based on local density and defines adjacency by the potential movement of a point within its privacy region. We present an interactive $(\varepsilon, δ)$-SLDP protocol, orchestrated by an honest-but-curious server over a public channel, to estimate these regions privately. Crucially, our framework decouples the privacy cost from the number of refinement iterations, allowing for high-resolution grids without additional privacy budget cost. We experimentally demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on estimation tasks across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的框架，用于校准AI模型性能，使其与人类水平相比较更为准确。

Abstract: Comparing AI models to "human level" is often misleading when benchmark scores are incommensurate or human baselines are drawn from a narrow population. To address this, we propose a framework that calibrates items against the 'world population' and report performance on a common, human-anchored scale. Concretely, we build on a set of multi-level scales for different capabilities where each level should represent a probability of success of the whole world population on a logarithmic scale with a base $B$. We calibrate each scale for each capability (reasoning, comprehension, knowledge, volume, etc.) by compiling publicly released human test data spanning education and reasoning benchmarks (PISA, TIMSS, ICAR, UKBioBank, and ReliabilityBench). The base $B$ is estimated by extrapolating between samples with two demographic profiles using LLMs, with the hypothesis that they condense rich information about human populations. We evaluate the quality of different mappings using group slicing and post-stratification. The new techniques allow for the recalibration and standardization of scales relative to the whole-world population.

Abstract: Gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent are central to modern machine learning, yet their behavior under large step sizes remains theoretically unclear. Recent work suggests that acceleration often arises near the edge of stability, where optimization trajectories become unstable and difficult to analyze. Existing results for separable logistic regression achieve faster convergence by explicitly leveraging such unstable regimes through constant or adaptive large step sizes. In this paper, we show that instability is not inherent to acceleration. We prove that gradient descent with a simple, non-adaptive increasing step-size schedule achieves exponential convergence for separable logistic regression under a margin condition, while remaining entirely within a stable optimization regime. The resulting method is anytime and does not require prior knowledge of the optimization horizon or target accuracy. We also establish exponential convergence of stochastic gradient descent using a lightweight adaptive step-size rule that avoids line search and specialized procedures, improving upon existing polynomial-rate guarantees. Together, our results demonstrate that carefully structured step-size growth alone suffices to obtain exponential acceleration for both gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent.

Abstract: Neural Processes (NPs), and specifically Transformer Neural Processes (TNPs), have demonstrated remarkable performance across tasks ranging from spatiotemporal forecasting to tabular data modelling. However, many of these applications are inherently sequential, involving continuous data streams such as real-time sensor readings or database updates. In such settings, models should support cheap, incremental updates rather than recomputing internal representations from scratch for every new observation -- a capability existing TNP variants lack. Drawing inspiration from Large Language Models, we introduce the Incremental TNP (incTNP). By leveraging causal masking, Key-Value (KV) caching, and a data-efficient autoregressive training strategy, incTNP matches the predictive performance of standard TNPs while reducing the computational cost of updates from quadratic to linear time complexity. We empirically evaluate our model on a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including tabular regression and temperature prediction. Our results show that, surprisingly, incTNP delivers performance comparable to -- or better than -- non-causal TNPs while unlocking orders-of-magnitude speedups for sequential inference. Finally, we assess the consistency of the model's updates -- by adapting a metric of ``implicit Bayesianness", we show that incTNP retains a prediction rule as implicitly Bayesian as standard non-causal TNPs, demonstrating that incTNP achieves the computational benefits of causal masking without sacrificing the consistency required for streaming inference.

Abstract: Theoretical analyses of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) are standardly framed within the Real-RAM model of computation. In this setting, training even simple neural networks is known to be $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete -- a complexity class believed to be harder than NP, that characterizes the difficulty of solving systems of polynomial inequalities over the real numbers. However, this algebraic framework diverges from the reality of digital computation with finite-precision hardware. In this work, we analyze the theoretical complexity of ERM under a realistic bit-level model ($\mathsf{ERM}_{\text{bit}}$), where network parameters and inputs are constrained to be rational numbers with polynomially bounded bit-lengths. Under this model, we reveal a sharp dichotomy in tractability governed by the network's activation function. We prove that for deep networks with {\em any} polynomial activations with rational coefficients and degree at least $2$, the bit-complexity of training is severe: deciding $\mathsf{ERM}_{\text{bit}}$ is $\#P$-Hard, hence believed to be strictly harder than NP-complete problems. Furthermore, we show that determining the sign of a single partial derivative of the empirical loss function is intractable (unlikely in BPP), and deciding a specific bit in the gradient is $\#P$-Hard. This provides a complexity-theoretic perspective for the phenomenon of exploding and vanishing gradients. In contrast, we show that for piecewise-linear activations such as ReLU, the precision requirements remain manageable: $\mathsf{ERM}_{\text{bit}}$ is contained within NP (specifically NP-complete), and standard backpropagation runs in polynomial time. Our results demonstrate that finite-precision constraints are not merely implementation details but fundamental determinants of learnability.

Conclusion: 主动数据重建攻击（ADRA）方法在LLM训练数据检测方面具有较高的准确性和有效性。

Abstract: Detecting LLM training data is generally framed as a membership inference attack (MIA) problem. However, conventional MIAs operate passively on fixed model weights, using log-likelihoods or text generations. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Active Data Reconstruction Attack} (ADRA), a family of MIA that actively induces a model to reconstruct a given text through training. We hypothesize that training data are \textit{more reconstructible} than non-members, and the difference in their reconstructibility can be exploited for membership inference. Motivated by findings that reinforcement learning (RL) sharpens behaviors already encoded in weights, we leverage on-policy RL to actively elicit data reconstruction by finetuning a policy initialized from the target model. To effectively use RL for MIA, we design reconstruction metrics and contrastive rewards. The resulting algorithms, \textsc{ADRA} and its adaptive variant \textsc{ADRA+}, improve both reconstruction and detection given a pool of candidate data. Experiments show that our methods consistently outperform existing MIAs in detecting pre-training, post-training, and distillation data, with an average improvement of 10.7\% over the previous runner-up. In particular, \MethodPlus~improves over Min-K\%++ by 18.8\% on BookMIA for pre-training detection and by 7.6\% on AIME for post-training detection.

TL;DR: 通过混合框架提高ILT优化性能，克服传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的ILT优化方法容易陷入局部最小值，生成AI的应用也有限。

Method: 将掩模合成重新定义为条件采样，使用WGAN和重建损失进行预训练，然后用GRPO和ILT引导的模仿损失进行微调。

Result: 在LithoBench数据集上，所提出的混合框架降低了EPE违规率，与强数值ILT基准相比，吞吐量提高了大约一倍，同时提高了最终的掩模质量。在ICCAD13竞赛案例上，EPE提高了20%，与SOTA数值ILT求解器相比，速度提高了3倍。

Conclusion: 所提出的混合框架通过学习提出ILT友好的初始化方案，缓解了非凸性，在性能上超越了传统的求解器和生成AI。

Abstract: Inverse lithography (ILT) is critical for modern semiconductor manufacturing but suffers from highly non-convex objectives that often trap optimization in poor local minima. Generative AI has been explored to warm-start ILT, yet most approaches train deterministic image-to-image translators to mimic sub-optimal datasets, providing limited guidance for escaping non-convex traps during refinement. We reformulate mask synthesis as conditional sampling: a generator learns a distribution over masks conditioned on the design and proposes multiple candidates. The generator is first pretrained with WGAN plus a reconstruction loss, then fine-tuned using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with an ILT-guided imitation loss. At inference, we sample a small batch of masks, run fast batched ILT refinement, evaluate lithography metrics (e.g., EPE, process window), and select the best candidate. On \texttt{LithoBench} dataset, the proposed hybrid framework reduces EPE violations under a 3\,nm tolerance and roughly doubles throughput versus a strong numerical ILT baseline, while improving final mask quality. We also present over 20\% EPE improvement on \texttt{ICCAD13} contest cases with 3$\times$ speedup over the SOTA numerical ILT solver. By learning to propose ILT-friendly initializations, our approach mitigates non-convexity and advances beyond what traditional solvers or GenAI can achieve.

Motivation: AI训练数据集中不可避免地包含AI生成的示例，导致模型输出影响另一个模型的训练，这种现象称为反馈。这种迭代反馈可能导致模型崩溃，但其背后的机制尚不清楚。

Method: 通过将迭代反馈建模为马尔可夫链，研究了MNIST和ImageNet上的扩散模型、CycleGAN以及音频反馈实验，以映射局部和全局流形几何的演变，并引入了八种崩溃行为的分类法。

Result: 发现一类广泛的反馈过程在潜在空间中收敛到一个低维不变结构，称为神经共振。提出了两个条件，即反馈过程的遍历性和潜在表示的方向性收缩，以实现这种共振。

Conclusion: 神经共振为生成模型中长期退化行为提供了一个统一的解释，并为识别、表征和最终缓解崩溃提供了实际诊断方法。

Abstract: AI training datasets will inevitably contain AI-generated examples, leading to ``feedback'' in which the output of one model impacts the training of another. It is known that such iterative feedback can lead to model collapse, yet the mechanisms underlying this degeneration remain poorly understood. Here we show that a broad class of feedback processes converges to a low-dimensional invariant structure in latent space, a phenomenon we call neural resonance. By modeling iterative feedback as a Markov Chain, we show that two conditions are needed for this resonance to occur: ergodicity of the feedback process and directional contraction of the latent representation. By studying diffusion models on MNIST and ImageNet, as well as CycleGAN and an audio feedback experiment, we map how local and global manifold geometry evolve, and we introduce an eight-pattern taxonomy of collapse behaviors. Neural resonance provides a unified explanation for long-term degenerate behavior in generative models and provides practical diagnostics for identifying, characterizing, and eventually mitigating collapse.

TL;DR: PROSPER：一种处理不传递偏好的有效PFT算法，提升LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在偏好微调（PFT）中，处理不传递（即循环）偏好是一个反复出现的挑战。不传递偏好通常源于单一目标的不一致排名或（ii）将多个目标量化为单个指标。无论其来源如何，不传递偏好的下游影响都是相同的：没有明确定义的最优策略，这打破了标准PFT流程的核心假设。为了应对这一挑战，我们提出了一个新颖的博弈论解决方案概念——最大熵Blackwell Winner（MaxEntBW），它在多目标不传递偏好下是明确定义的。为了能够在大规模上计算MaxEntBW，我们推导出PROSPER：一个可证明有效的PFT算法。与先前的自我博弈技术不同，PROSPER直接处理多个目标，而无需量化。然后，我们将PROSPER应用于从多目标LLM作为法官的反馈（例如，基于评分的法官）微调大型语言模型（LLM）的问题，这是一个两种不传递来源都出现的设置。我们发现，PROSPER在指令遵循和通用聊天基准测试中优于所有考虑的基线，在70亿和30亿参数规模上发布训练模型检查点。

Method: 提出了一种名为PROSPER的PFT算法，该算法能够处理不传递偏好，无需量化。它直接处理多个目标，并应用于微调大型语言模型（LLM）。

Conclusion: PROSPER是一种有效的PFT算法，能够处理不传递偏好，并显著提升大型语言模型的性能。

Abstract: A recurring challenge in preference fine-tuning (PFT) is handling $\textit{intransitive}$ (i.e., cyclic) preferences. Intransitive preferences often stem from either $\textit{(i)}$ inconsistent rankings along a single objective or $\textit{(ii)}$ scalarizing multiple objectives into a single metric. Regardless of their source, the downstream implication of intransitive preferences is the same: there is no well-defined optimal policy, breaking a core assumption of the standard PFT pipeline. In response, we propose a novel, game-theoretic solution concept -- the $\textit{Maximum Entropy Blackwell Winner}$ ($\textit{MaxEntBW}$) -- that is well-defined under multi-objective intransitive preferences. To enable computing MaxEntBWs at scale, we derive $\texttt{PROSPER}$: a provably efficient PFT algorithm. Unlike prior self-play techniques, $\texttt{PROSPER}$ directly handles multiple objectives without requiring scalarization. We then apply $\texttt{PROSPER}$ to the problem of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) from multi-objective LLM-as-a-Judge feedback (e.g., rubric-based judges), a setting where both sources of intransitivity arise. We find that $\texttt{PROSPER}$ outperforms all baselines considered across both instruction following and general chat benchmarks, releasing trained model checkpoints at the 7B and 3B parameter scales.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently achieved strong results in text generation. However, their multi-step sampling leads to slow inference, limiting practical use. To address this, we extend Inverse Distillation, a technique originally developed to accelerate continuous diffusion models, to the discrete setting. Nonetheless, this extension introduces both theoretical and practical challenges. From a theoretical perspective, the inverse distillation objective lacks uniqueness guarantees, which may lead to suboptimal solutions. From a practical standpoint, backpropagation in the discrete space is non-trivial and often unstable. To overcome these challenges, we first provide a theoretical result demonstrating that our inverse formulation admits a unique solution, thereby ensuring valid optimization. We then introduce gradient-stable relaxations to support effective training. As a result, experiments on multiple DLMs show that our method, Inverse-distilled Diffusion Language Models (IDLM), reduces the number of inference steps by 4x-64x, while preserving the teacher model's entropy and generative perplexity.

Result: TimeRadar能够有效区分异常模式与常规模式，适用于不同数据集的时间序列异常检测。

Conclusion: TimeRadar为时间序列异常检测提供了一种新的方法，提高了检测的准确性。

Abstract: Current time series foundation models (TSFMs) primarily focus on learning prevalent and regular patterns within a predefined time or frequency domain to enable supervised downstream tasks (e.g., forecasting). Consequently, they are often ineffective for inherently unsupervised downstream tasks-such as time series anomaly detection (TSAD), which aims to identify rare, irregular patterns. This limitation arises because such abnormal patterns can closely resemble the regular patterns when presented in the same time/frequency domain. To address this issue, we introduce TimeRadar, an innovative TSFM built in a fractional time-frequency domain to support generalist TSAD across diverse unseen datasets. Our key insight is that rotating a time series into a data-dependent fractional time-frequency representation can adaptively differentiate the normal and abnormal signals across different datasets. To this end, a novel component, namely Fractionally modulated Time-Frequency Reconstruction (FTFRecon), is proposed in TimeRadar to leverage a learnable fractional order to rotate the time series to the most pronounced angle between a continuous time and frequency domain for accurate data reconstruction. This provides adaptive data reconstruction in an optimal time-frequency domain for each data input, enabling effective differentiation of the unbounded abnormal patterns from the regular ones across datasets, including unseen datasets. To allow TimeRadar to model local abnormality that is not captured by the global data reconstruction, we further introduce a Contextual Deviation Learning (CDL) component to model the local deviation of the input relative to its contextual time series data in the rotatable domain.

TL;DR: We develop a robust Bayesian random feature regression model with improved predictive uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: We propose a robust Bayesian formulation of random feature (RF) regression.

Method: We use Huber-style contamination sets to account explicitly for prior and likelihood misspecification.

Result: We derive explicit and tractable bounds for the resulting lower and upper posterior predictive densities. We introduce an Imprecise Highest Density Region (IHDR) for robust predictive uncertainty quantification. We further obtain predictive variance bounds and prove that they preserve the leading-order proportional-growth asymptotics known for RF models.

Conclusion: This establishes a robustness theory for Bayesian random features, with predictive uncertainty remaining computationally tractable and inheriting the classical double-descent phase structure.

Abstract: We propose a robust Bayesian formulation of random feature (RF) regression that accounts explicitly for prior and likelihood misspecification via Huber-style contamination sets. Starting from the classical equivalence between ridge-regularized RF training and Bayesian inference with Gaussian priors and likelihoods, we replace the single prior and likelihood with $ε$- and $η$-contaminated credal sets, respectively, and perform inference using pessimistic generalized Bayesian updating. We derive explicit and tractable bounds for the resulting lower and upper posterior predictive densities. These bounds show that, when contamination is moderate, prior and likelihood ambiguity effectively acts as a direct contamination of the posterior predictive distribution, yielding uncertainty envelopes around the classical Gaussian predictive. We introduce an Imprecise Highest Density Region (IHDR) for robust predictive uncertainty quantification and show that it admits an efficient outer approximation via an adjusted Gaussian credible interval. We further obtain predictive variance bounds (under a mild truncation approximation for the upper bound) and prove that they preserve the leading-order proportional-growth asymptotics known for RF models. Together, these results establish a robustness theory for Bayesian random features: predictive uncertainty remains computationally tractable, inherits the classical double-descent phase structure, and is improved by explicit worst-case guarantees under bounded prior and likelihood misspecification.

TL;DR: 本研究使用影响函数检测标签偏差，在MNIST和CheXpert数据集上取得了成功，突出了其潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据收集过程中的资源限制或无意识偏见，标签偏差会导致子群体之间的标签错误率不平等或子群体患病率的误代表。大多数公平约束假设训练标签反映了真实分布，当存在标签偏差时，它们变得无效，留下了一个挑战性的问题：我们如何检测这样的标签偏差？

Method: 本研究探讨了是否可以使用影响函数来检测标签偏差。影响函数通过利用损失函数的梯度和Hessian来估计每个训练样本对模型预测的影响——当标签错误发生时，影响函数可以识别训练集中的错误标签样本，揭示潜在的失败模式。我们开发了一个样本评估流程，并在MNIST数据集上进行了测试，然后扩展到更复杂的CheXpert医学影像数据集。为了检验标签噪声，我们在数据集中翻转了20%的一个类别的标签。使用对角Hessian近似，我们展示了有希望的结果，成功检测了MNIST中近90%的错误标签样本。在CheXpert上，错误标签样本表现出一致较高的影响分数。这些结果突出了影响函数在识别标签错误方面的潜力。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上，使用对角Hessian近似，成功检测了近90%的错误标签样本。在CheXpert数据集上，错误标签样本表现出一致较高的影响分数。

Conclusion: 影响函数在识别标签错误方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Labeling bias arises during data collection due to resource limitations or unconscious bias, leading to unequal label error rates across subgroups or misrepresentation of subgroup prevalence. Most fairness constraints assume training labels reflect the true distribution, rendering them ineffective when labeling bias is present; leaving a challenging question, that \textit{how can we detect such labeling bias?} In this work, we investigate whether influence functions can be used to detect labeling bias. Influence functions estimate how much each training sample affects a model's predictions by leveraging the gradient and Hessian of the loss function -- when labeling errors occur, influence functions can identify wrongly labeled samples in the training set, revealing the underlying failure mode. We develop a sample valuation pipeline and test it first on the MNIST dataset, then scaled to the more complex CheXpert medical imaging dataset. To examine label noise, we introduced controlled errors by flipping 20\% of the labels for one class in the dataset. Using a diagonal Hessian approximation, we demonstrated promising results, successfully detecting nearly 90\% of mislabeled samples in MNIST. On CheXpert, mislabeled samples consistently exhibit higher influence scores. These results highlight the potential of influence functions for identifying label errors.

Abstract: Supervised causal learning has shown promise in causal discovery, yet it often struggles with generalization across diverse interventional settings, particularly when intervention targets are unknown. To address this, we propose TICL (Test-time Interventional Causal Learning), a novel method that synergizes Test-Time Training with Joint Causal Inference. Specifically, we design a self-augmentation strategy to generate instance-specific training data at test time, effectively avoiding distribution shifts. Furthermore, by integrating joint causal inference, we developed a PC-inspired two-phase supervised learning scheme, which effectively leverages self-augmented training data while ensuring theoretical identifiability. Extensive experiments on bnlearn benchmarks demonstrate TICL's superiority in multiple aspects of causal discovery and intervention target detection.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for practically applicable learnable optimization algorithms, unlocking exploration of richer meta-training and data curation recipes.

Abstract: Learned optimizers are powerful alternatives to hand-designed update rules like Adam, yet they have seen limited practical adoption since they often fail to meta-generalize beyond their training distribution and incur high meta-training cost. For instance, prior work, VeLO, scaled meta-training to 4,000 TPU months ($\sim$10$\times$ GPT-3 compute) to meta-train a general-purpose optimizer but it failed to generalize beyond 600M parameters tasks. In this work, we present a surprising finding: by crafting a simple normalized optimizer architecture and augmenting meta-training, it becomes feasible to meta-train a performant general-purpose learned update rule on a tiny fraction of VeLO compute, 4.5 GPU hours to be precise. Our learned update rule scales stably to a billion-scale pretraining task (GPT-3 XL 1.3B) which is six orders of magnitude larger than its meta-training distribution. Furthermore, it shows strong performance across diverse out-of-distribution tasks and is compatible with modern optimization harness that includes orthogonalization, distinct update rules for input-output and hidden weights, and decoupled weight decay. In all, this work paves the way for practically applicable learnable optimization algorithms, unlocking exploration of richer meta-training and data curation recipes to further improve performance.

Abstract: I introduce Virtual Parameter Sharpening (VPS), an inference-time technique that augments frozen transformer linear layers with dynamic, activation-conditioned low-rank perturbations. Unlike parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA, which learn static low-rank adapters, VPS constructs its perturbation factors on the fly from batch activation statistics and optional gradient signals, enabling test-time adaptation without persistent parameter updates. The perturbation takes the form Delta W = gamma * W^T V U^T W, where selector matrices U and V are constructed via sparse activation-guided selection or Sylvester-coupled regression. We provide a theoretical analysis of the perturbation's spectral properties and describe an adaptive policy system that modulates perturbation magnitude based on activation energy and token-level entropy. This system incorporates multi-objective verification with iterative refinement for tasks with ground-truth supervision. We present the complete algorithmic framework, analyze its mathematical foundations, and discuss the mechanisms by which activation-conditioned computation may enhance reasoning capabilities in large language models. Implementation and experimental code are available at https://github.com/Saba-Kublashvili/vps-virtual-parameter-synthesis .

Abstract: Realizable online regression can behave very differently from online classification. Even without any margin or stochastic assumptions, realizability may enforce horizon-free (finite) cumulative loss under metric-like losses, even when the analogous classification problem has an infinite mistake bound. We study realizable online regression in the adversarial model under losses that satisfy an approximate triangle inequality (approximate pseudo-metrics). Recent work of Attias et al. shows that the minimax realizable cumulative loss is characterized by the scaled Littlestone/online dimension $\mathbb{D}_{\mathrm{onl}}$, but this quantity can be difficult to analyze.
  Our main contribution is a generic potential method that upper bounds $\mathbb{D}_{\mathrm{onl}}$ by a concrete Dudley-type entropy integral that depends only on covering numbers of the hypothesis class under the induced sup pseudo-metric. We define an \emph{entropy potential} $Φ(\mathcal{H})=\int_{0}^{diam(\mathcal{H})} \log N(\mathcal{H},\varepsilon)\,d\varepsilon$, where $N(\mathcal{H},\varepsilon)$ is the $\varepsilon$-covering number of $\mathcal{H}$, and show that for every $c$-approximate pseudo-metric loss, $\mathbb{D}_{\mathrm{onl}}(\mathcal{H})\le O(c)\,Φ(\mathcal{H})$. In particular, polynomial metric entropy implies $Φ(\mathcal{H})<\infty$ and hence a horizon-free realizable cumulative-loss bound with transparent dependence on effective dimension.
  We illustrate the method on two families. We prove a sharp $q$-vs.-$d$ dichotomy for realizable online learning (finite and efficiently achievable $Θ_{d,q}(L^d)$ total loss for $L$-Lipschitz regression iff $q>d$, otherwise infinite), and for bounded-norm $k$-ReLU networks separate regression (finite loss, even $\widetilde O(k^2)$, and $O(1)$ for one ReLU) from classification (impossible already for $k=2,d=1$).

Conclusion: HybridFL能够有效解决复杂混合数据分布问题，在金融犯罪检测中具有显著优势

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train models on privately owned data without sharing raw information. While standard FL typically addresses either horizontal or vertical data partitions, many real-world scenarios exhibit a complex hybrid distribution. This paper proposes Hybrid Federated Learning (HybridFL) to address data split both horizontally across disjoint users and vertically across complementary feature sets. We evaluate HybridFL in a financial crime detection context, where a transaction party holds transaction-level attributes and multiple banks maintain private account-level features. By integrating horizontal aggregation and vertical feature fusion, the proposed architecture enables joint learning while strictly preserving data locality. Experiments on AMLSim and SWIFT datasets demonstrate that HybridFL significantly outperforms the transaction-only local model and achieves performance comparable to a centralized benchmark.

Result: 在多种数学推理基准测试中，DynaMO在强化学习可验证奖励（RLVR）方面取得了显著的改进。

Conclusion: DynaMO框架在RLVR中表现出色，为LLM推理提供了有效的优化策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, yet current methods face key challenges in resource allocation and policy optimization dynamics: (i) uniform rollout allocation ignores gradient variance heterogeneity across problems, and (ii) the softmax policy structure causes gradient attenuation for high-confidence correct actions, while excessive gradient updates may destabilize training. Therefore, we propose DynaMO, a theoretically-grounded dual-pronged optimization framework. At the sequence level, we prove that uniform allocation is suboptimal and derive variance-minimizing allocation from the first principle, establishing Bernoulli variance as a computable proxy for gradient informativeness. At the token level, we develop gradient-aware advantage modulation grounded in theoretical analysis of gradient magnitude bounds. Our framework compensates for gradient attenuation of high-confidence correct actions while utilizing entropy changes as computable indicators to stabilize excessive update magnitudes. Extensive experiments conducted on a diverse range of mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong RLVR baselines. Our implementation is available at: \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/dynamo-680E/README.md}{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/dynamo}.

Conclusion: 组合可解释性有助于理解预训练模型中知识的持久性

Abstract: While many recent methods aim to unlearn or remove knowledge from pretrained models, seemingly erased knowledge often persists and can be recovered in various ways. Because large foundation models are far from interpretable, understanding whether and how such knowledge persists remains a significant challenge. To address this, we turn to the recently developed framework of combinatorial interpretability. This framework, designed for two-layer neural networks, enables direct inspection of the knowledge encoded in the model weights. We reproduce baseline unlearning methods within the combinatorial interpretability setting and examine their behavior along two dimensions: (i) whether they truly remove knowledge of a target concept (the concept we wish to remove) or merely inhibit its expression while retaining the underlying information, and (ii) how easily the supposedly erased knowledge can be recovered through various fine-tuning operations. Our results shed light within a fully interpretable setting on how knowledge can persist despite unlearning and when it might resurface.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models aim to make machine learning accessible for enterprise data without task-specific training. This paper presents the first independent evaluation of SAP's Retrieval Pretrained Transformer (RPT-1) from a practitioner perspective. RPT-1 is a compact 64.6 MB model pretrained on 1.34 TB of structured data across 3.1 million tables. We benchmark it against tuned gradient-boosted decision trees (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) on three SAP business scenarios: demand forecasting across SD/MM/PP modules, predictive data integrity in BC/MM/QM, and financial risk classification in FI/CO/AR. Across five-fold cross-validation on datasets ranging from 2,500 to 3,200 rows, RPT-1 reaches 91-96% of tuned GBDT accuracy without any training examples. The classification gap is modest at 3.6-4.1 percentage points on AUC-ROC, though regression tasks show wider gaps of 8.9-11.1 percentage points on R-squared. An interesting finding is a crossover at roughly 75-100 context rows where RPT-1 actually outperforms XGBoost under limited data. Based on these results, we propose a practical hybrid workflow: use RPT-1 for rapid screening, then train GBDT selectively where prediction accuracy justifies the effort. All experiments are reproducible through publicly available Hugging Face Spaces.

Result: 在UCI回归数据集上的约5000次实验中验证，X-ANFIS在保持有竞争力的预测精度的同时，始终达到目标可区分性，并从MOO帕累托前沿的凸包之外恢复解决方案。

Conclusion: X-ANFIS在可解释人工智能领域具有潜力，并提供了优于现有方法的结果。

Abstract: Fuzzy systems show strong potential in explainable AI due to their rule-based architecture and linguistic variables. Existing approaches navigate the accuracy-explainability trade-off either through evolutionary multi-objective optimization (MOO), which is computationally expensive, or gradient-based scalarization, which cannot recover non-convex Pareto regions. We propose X-ANFIS, an alternating bi-objective gradient-based optimization scheme for explainable adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems. Cauchy membership functions are used for stable training under semantically controlled initializations, and a differentiable explainability objective is introduced and decoupled from the performance objective through alternating gradient passes. Validated in approximately 5,000 experiments on nine UCI regression datasets, X-ANFIS consistently achieves target distinguishability while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy, recovering solutions beyond the convex hull of the MOO Pareto front.

TL;DR: DGPO通过强化学习引导的离散扩散，为有向组合结构提供了一种可控的生成框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有图扩散方法在处理有向无环图（DAG）时丢弃边缘方向信息的问题，提出了定向图策略优化（DGPO）。

Method: 通过拓扑节点排序和位置编码，将离散图扩散模型的强化学习微调扩展到DAG。

Result: 在NAS-Bench-101和NAS-Bench-201上验证，DGPO在所有三个NAS-Bench-201任务上达到了基准最优（91.61%，73.49%，46.77%）。

Conclusion: DGPO能够学习可迁移的结构先验，通过在搜索空间的7%上进行预训练，在微调后生成接近最优架构，且在训练上限之外外推7.3个百分点。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning fine-tuning has proven effective for steering generative diffusion models toward desired properties in image and molecular domains. Graph diffusion models have similarly been applied to combinatorial structure generation, including neural architecture search (NAS). However, neural architectures are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) where edge direction encodes functional semantics such as data flow-information that existing graph diffusion methods, designed for undirected structures, discard. We propose Directed Graph Policy Optimization (DGPO), which extends reinforcement learning fine-tuning of discrete graph diffusion models to DAGs via topological node ordering and positional encoding. Validated on NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201, DGPO matches the benchmark optimum on all three NAS-Bench-201 tasks (91.61%, 73.49%, 46.77%). The central finding is that the model learns transferable structural priors: pretrained on only 7% of the search space, it generates near-oracle architectures after fine-tuning, within 0.32 percentage points of the full-data model and extrapolating 7.3 percentage points beyond its training ceiling. Bidirectional control experiments confirm genuine reward-driven steering, with inverse optimization reaching near random-chance accuracy (9.5%). These results demonstrate that reinforcement learning-steered discrete diffusion, once extended to handle directionality, provides a controllable generative framework for directed combinatorial structures.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by neural networks as well as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), including physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), physics-informed KANs (PIKANs), and neural operators, are known to exhibit spectral bias, whereby low-frequency components of the solution are learned significantly faster than high-frequency modes. While spectral bias is often treated as an intrinsic representational limitation of neural architectures, its interaction with optimization dynamics and physics-based loss formulations remains poorly understood. In this work, we provide a systematic investigation of spectral bias in physics-informed and operator learning frameworks, with emphasis on the coupled roles of network architecture, activation functions, loss design, and optimization strategy. We quantify spectral bias through frequency-resolved error metrics, Barron-norm diagnostics, and higher-order statistical moments, enabling a unified analysis across elliptic, hyperbolic, and dispersive PDEs. Through diverse benchmark problems, including the Korteweg-de Vries, wave and steady-state diffusion-reaction equations, turbulent flow reconstruction, and earthquake dynamics, we demonstrate that spectral bias is not simply representational but fundamentally dynamical. In particular, second-order optimization methods substantially alter the spectral learning order, enabling earlier and more accurate recovery of high-frequency modes for all PDE types. For neural operators, we further show that spectral bias is dependent on the neural operator architecture and can also be effectively mitigated through spectral-aware loss formulations without increasing the inference cost.

Method: 提出了一种名为FedPAC的预条件器对齐和校正框架，该框架通过显式地将参数聚合与几何同步解耦，包括对齐和校正两个步骤

Result: FedPAC在视觉和语言任务上提高了稳定性和准确性，在CIFAR-100上与ViTs结合时，绝对精度提高了5.8%

Conclusion: FedPAC能够有效解决第二阶优化器在非IID数据上的不稳定性和发散问题，提高了联邦第二阶优化的可靠性

Abstract: Second-order optimizers can significantly accelerate large-scale training, yet their naive federated variants are often unstable or even diverge on non-IID data.
  We show that a key culprit is \emph{preconditioner drift}: client-side second-order training induces heterogeneous \emph{curvature-defined geometries} (i.e., preconditioner coordinate systems), and server-side model averaging updates computed under incompatible metrics, corrupting the global descent direction.
  To address this geometric mismatch, we propose \texttt{FedPAC}, a \emph{preconditioner alignment and correction} framework for reliable federated second-order optimization.
  \texttt{FedPAC} explicitly decouples parameter aggregation from geometry synchronization by:
  (i) \textbf{Alignment} (i.e.,aggregating local preconditioners into a global reference and warm-starting clients via global preconditioner); and
  (ii) \textbf{Correction} (i.e., steering local preconditioned updates using a global preconditioned direction to suppress long-term drift).
  We provide drift-coupled non-convex convergence guarantees with linear speedup under partial participation.
  Empirically, \texttt{FedPAC} consistently improves stability and accuracy across vision and language tasks, achieving up to $5.8\%$ absolute accuracy gain on CIFAR-100 with ViTs.

TL;DR: AdsorbFlow is a more efficient and accurate method for identifying low-energy adsorption geometries on catalytic surfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying low-energy adsorption geometries on catalytic surfaces is a practical bottleneck for computational heterogeneous catalysis.

Method: AdsorbFlow, a deterministic generative model that learns an energy-conditioned vector field on the rigid-body configuration space of adsorbate translation and rotation via conditional flow matching.

Result: AdsorbFlow achieves higher success rates and lower anomaly rates compared to AdsorbDiff and AdsorbML, while using fewer generative steps and with a smaller MLFF-to-DFT gap.

Conclusion: Deterministic transport is both faster and more accurate than stochastic denoising for adsorbate placement.

Abstract: Identifying low-energy adsorption geometries on catalytic surfaces is a practical bottleneck for computational heterogeneous catalysis: the difficulty lies not only in the cost of density functional theory (DFT) but in proposing initial placements that relax into the correct energy basins. Conditional denoising diffusion has improved success rates, yet requires $\sim$100 iterative steps per sample.
  Here we introduce AdsorbFlow, a deterministic generative model that learns an energy-conditioned vector field on the rigid-body configuration space of adsorbate translation and rotation via conditional flow matching. Energy information enters through classifier-free guidance conditioning -- not energy-gradient guidance -- and sampling reduces to integrating an ODE in as few as 5 steps.
  On OC20-Dense with full DFT single-point verification, AdsorbFlow with an EquiformerV2 backbone achieves 61.4% SR@10 and 34.1% SR@1 -- surpassing AdsorbDiff (31.8% SR@1, 41.0% SR@10) at every evaluation level and AdsorbML (47.7% SR@10) -- while using 20 times fewer generative steps and achieving the lowest anomaly rate among generative methods (6.8%). On 50 out-of-distribution systems, AdsorbFlow retains 58.0% SR@10 with a MLFF-to-DFT gap of only 4~percentage points. These results establish that deterministic transport is both faster and more accurate than stochastic denoising for adsorbate placement.

Motivation: 提高大型语言模型（LLM）推理能力

Method: 提出DSDR强化学习框架，包括全局和耦合组件，以促进多样性探索

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中表现出色，提高了准确性和pass@k值

Conclusion: DSDR能够有效地提高RLVR中的深度探索能力

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiers (RLVR) is a central paradigm for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet existing methods often suffer from limited exploration. Policies tend to collapse onto a few reasoning patterns and prematurely stop deep exploration, while conventional entropy regularization introduces only local stochasticity and fails to induce meaningful path-level diversity, leading to weak and unstable learning signals in group-based policy optimization. We propose DSDR, a Dual-Scale Diversity Regularization reinforcement learning framework that decomposes diversity in LLM reasoning into global and coupling components. Globally, DSDR promotes diversity among correct reasoning trajectories to explore distinct solution modes. Locally, it applies a length-invariant, token-level entropy regularization restricted to correct trajectories, preventing entropy collapse within each mode while preserving correctness. The two scales are coupled through a global-to-local allocation mechanism that emphasizes local regularization for more distinctive correct trajectories. We provide theoretical support showing that DSDR preserves optimal correctness under bounded regularization, sustains informative learning signals in group-based optimization, and yields a principled global-to-local coupling rule. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in accuracy and pass@k, highlighting the importance of dual-scale diversity for deep exploration in RLVR.

Motivation: Recent research on LLM alignment focuses on developing new policy optimization methods based on GRPO.

Method: Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization (GMPO), and Soft Sequence Policy Optimization (a new proposed method).

Result: The new method aims to promote effective policy exploration while maintaining training stability.

Conclusion: This paper proposes a novel approach for LLM alignment by integrating soft gating functions over token-level probability ratios within sequence-level importance weights.

Abstract: A significant portion of recent research on Large Language Model (LLM) alignment focuses on developing new policy optimization methods based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Two prominent directions have emerged: (i) a shift toward sequence-level importance sampling weights that better align with the sequence-level rewards used in many tasks, and (ii) alternatives to PPO-style clipping that aim to avoid the associated loss of training signal and entropy collapse. Recent work, such as Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), reformulates the Scopic objective within the GRPO framework and achieves both sequence coherence and token adaptivity. Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization (GMPO) leverages token-wise ratio clipping within sequence importance sampling weights. Building on these ideas, this work proposes a new objective that promotes effective policy exploration while maintaining training stability. Specifically, we introduce Soft Sequence Policy Optimization, an off-policy reinforcement learning objective that incorporates soft gating functions over token-level probability ratios within sequence-level importance weights.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly explored for physical design analysis in Electronic Design Automation, particularly for modeling Clock Tree Synthesis behavior such as clock skew and buffering complexity. However, practical deployment remains limited due to the prohibitive memory and runtime cost of operating on raw gate-level netlists. Graph coarsening is commonly used to improve scalability, yet its impact on CTS-critical learning objectives is not well characterized. This paper introduces CTS-Bench, a benchmark suite for systematically evaluating the trade-offs between graph coarsening, prediction accuracy, and computational efficiency in GNN-based CTS analysis. CTS-Bench consists of 4,860 converged physical design solutions spanning five architectures and provides paired raw gate-level and clustered graph representations derived from post-placement designs. Using clock skew prediction as a representative CTS task, we demonstrate a clear accuracy-efficiency trade-off. While graph coarsening reduces GPU memory usage by up to 17.2x and accelerates training by up to 3x, it also removes structural information essential for modeling clock distribution, frequently resulting in negative $R^2$ scores under zero-shot evaluation. Our findings indicate that generic graph clustering techniques can fundamentally compromise CTS learning objectives, even when global physical metrics remain unchanged. CTS-Bench enables principled evaluation of CTS-aware graph coarsening strategies, supports benchmarking of GNN architectures and accelerators under realistic physical design constraints, and provides a foundation for developing learning-assisted CTS analysis and optimization techniques.

Motivation: 模型合并已成为一种强大的范式，用于结合不同专家模型的能力，而无需重新训练的高计算成本，但当前方法在本质上受到同构架构的限制。对于GNN，消息传递是拓扑依赖的，并且对不匹配敏感，使得直接参数空间合并不可靠。

Method: 我们引入了H-GRAMA（异构图路由和消息对齐），这是一个无需训练的框架，将合并从参数空间提升到操作空间。我们正式化了通用消息传递混合（UMPM），这是一个共享的操作族，它使用通用功能语言表达异构GNN层。

Result: H-GRAMA实现了跨架构GNN合并（例如，GCN到GAT），无需重新训练，在大多数情况下在兼容深度设置中保留了高专家精度，并且比集成实现了1.2倍到1.9倍的推理速度提升。

Conclusion: H-GRAMA是一种有效的跨架构GNN合并方法，无需重新训练，同时保持了高精度和推理速度。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a powerful paradigm for combining the capabilities of distinct expert models without the high computational cost of retraining, yet current methods are fundamentally constrained to homogeneous architectures. For GNNs, however, message passing is topology-dependent and sensitive to misalignment, making direct parameter-space merging unreliable. To bridge this gap, we introduce H-GRAMA (Heterogeneous Graph Routing and Message Alignment), a training-free framework that lifts merging from parameter space to operator space. We formalize Universal Message Passing Mixture (UMPM), a shared operator family that expresses heterogeneous GNN layers in a common functional language. H-GRAMA enables cross-architecture GNN merging (e.g., GCN to GAT) without retraining, retaining high specialist accuracy in most cases in compatible depth settings and achieving inference speedups of 1.2x to 1.9x over ensembles.

Conclusion: 软自适应策略优化（SAPO）能够提高大型语言模型的训练稳定性，并通过实验验证了不同门函数的有效性

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has significantly advanced the training of large language models and enhanced their reasoning capabilities, while it remains susceptible to instability due to the use of hard clipping. Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO) addresses this limitation by replacing clipping with a smooth sigmoid-based gate function, which leads to more stable updates. We have decided to push this theory further and investigate the impact of different gate functions on both training stability and final model performance. We formalize the key properties that admissible gates should satisfy and identify several families of such functions for empirical evaluation. This paper presents an analysis of our findings based on experiments conducted with the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model on mathematical reasoning tasks. These results provide practical guidance for designing smoother and more robust policy optimization objectives for large language model training.

Motivation: 提高机器学习系统的泛化能力

Method: 提出互补学习系统（CLS）

Result: 实现快速学习，同时避免泛化导致的干扰

Conclusion: 为鲁棒的持续学习提供途径

Abstract: Generalization is often regarded as an essential property of machine learning systems. However, perhaps not every component of a system needs to generalize. Training models for generalization typically produces entangled representations at the boundaries of entities or classes, which can lead to destructive interference when rapid, high-magnitude updates are required for continual or few-shot learning. Techniques for fast learning with non-interfering representations exist, but they generally fail to generalize. Here, we describe a Complementary Learning System (CLS) in which the fast learner entirely foregoes generalization in exchange for continual zero-shot and few-shot learning. Unlike most CLS approaches, which use episodic memory primarily for replay and consolidation, our fast, disentangled learner operates as a parallel reasoning system. The fast learner can overcome observation variability and uncertainty by leveraging a conventional slow, statistical learner within an active perception system: A contextual bias provided by the fast learner induces the slow learner to encode novel stimuli in familiar, generalized terms, enabling zero-shot and few-shot learning. This architecture demonstrates that fast, context-driven reasoning can coexist with slow, structured generalization, providing a pathway for robust continual learning.

Conclusion: OAPL能够在训练和推理策略之间存在超过400个梯度步长的滞后情况下，实现高效的、有效的后训练，离策略程度是先前方法的100倍。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently use on-policy algorithms, such as PPO or GRPO. However, policy lag from distributed training architectures and differences between the training and inference policies break this assumption, making the data off-policy by design. To rectify this, prior work has focused on making this off-policy data appear more on-policy, either via importance sampling (IS), or by more closely aligning the training and inference policies by explicitly modifying the inference engine. In this work, we embrace off-policyness and propose a novel off-policy RL algorithm that does not require these modifications: Optimal Advantage-based Policy Optimization with Lagged Inference policy (OAPL). We show that OAPL outperforms GRPO with importance sampling on competition math benchmarks, and can match the performance of a publicly available coding model, DeepCoder, on LiveCodeBench, while using 3x fewer generations during training. We further empirically demonstrate that models trained via OAPL have improved test time scaling under the Pass@k metric. OAPL allows for efficient, effective post-training even with lags of more than 400 gradient steps between the training and inference policies, 100x more off-policy than prior approaches.

Result: Improves performance under non-stationarity while reducing representation collapse, neuron dormancy, and training instability.

Conclusion: Isotropic Gaussian embeddings are provably advantageous under non-stationary targets.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning systems often suffer from unstable training dynamics due to non-stationarity, where learning objectives and data distributions evolve over time. We show that under non-stationary targets, isotropic Gaussian embeddings are provably advantageous. In particular, they induce stable tracking of time-varying targets for linear readouts, achieve maximal entropy under a fixed variance budget, and encourage a balanced use of all representational dimensions--all of which enable agents to be more adaptive and stable. Building on this insight, we propose the use of Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization for shaping representations toward an isotropic Gaussian distribution during training. We demonstrate empirically, over a variety of domains, that this simple and computationally inexpensive method improves performance under non-stationarity while reducing representation collapse, neuron dormancy, and training instability.

Abstract: Graphs provide a powerful basis for modeling Web-based relational data, with expressive GNNs to support the effective learning in dynamic web environments. However, real-world deployment is hindered by pervasive out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts, where evolving user activity and changing content semantics alter feature distributions and labeling criteria. These shifts often lead to unstable or overconfident predictions, undermining the trustworthiness required for Web4Good applications. Achieving reliable OOD generalization demands principled and interpretable uncertainty estimation; however, existing methods are largely post-hoc, insensitive to distribution shifts, and unable to explain where uncertainty arises especially in high-stakes settings. To address these limitations, we introduce SpIking GrapH predicTive coding (SIGHT), an uncertainty-aware plug-in graph learning module for reliable OOD Generalization. SIGHT performs iterative, error-driven correction over spiking graph states, enabling models to expose internal mismatch signals that reveal where predictions become unreliable. Across multiple graph benchmarks and diverse OOD scenarios, SIGHT consistently enhances predictive accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and interpretability when integrated with GNNs.

Abstract: Steck, Ekanadham, and Kallus [arXiv:2403.05440] demonstrate that cosine similarity of learned embeddings from matrix factorization models can be rendered arbitrary by a diagonal ``gauge'' matrix $D$. Their result is correct and important for practitioners who compute cosine similarity on embeddings trained with dot-product objectives. However, we argue that their conclusion, cautioning against cosine similarity in general, conflates the pathology of an incompatible training objective with the geometric validity of cosine distance on the unit sphere. We prove that when embeddings are constrained to the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ (either during or after training with an appropriate objective), the $D$-matrix ambiguity vanishes identically, and cosine distance reduces to exactly half the squared Euclidean distance. This monotonic equivalence implies that cosine-based and Euclidean-based neighbor rankings are identical on normalized embeddings. The ``problem'' with cosine similarity is not cosine similarity, it is the failure to normalize.

Abstract: The rise of app-based ride-sharing has fundamentally changed tipping culture in New York City. We analyzed 280 million trips from 2024 to see if we could predict tips for traditional taxis versus high-volume for-hire services. By testing methods from linear regression to deep neural networks, we found two very different outcomes. Traditional taxis are highly predictable ($R^2 \approx 0.72$) due to the in-car payment screen. In contrast, app-based tipping is random and hard to model ($R^2 \approx 0.17$). In conclusion, we show that building one universal model is a mistake and, due to Simpson's paradox, a combined model looks accurate on average but fails to predict tips for individual taxi categories requiring specialized models.

Result: Achieves a superior net ROI of 0.72% compared to both passive and aggressive strategies. Reduces rebalancing frequency by 67% compared to a greedy rebalancing strategy while maintaining 88% active time.

Conclusion: Regime-aware laziness can significantly improve capital efficiency by preserving the returns that would otherwise be eroded by the operational costs.

Abstract: Concentrated liquidity provision in decentralized exchanges presents a fundamental Impulse Control problem. Liquidity Providers (LPs) face a non-trivial trade-off between maximizing fee accrual through tight price-range concentration and minimizing the friction costs of rebalancing, including gas fees and swap slippage. Existing methods typically employ heuristic or threshold strategies that fail to account for market dynamics. This paper formulates liquidity management as an optimal control problem and derives the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman quasi-variational inequality (HJB-QVI). We present an approximate solution RAmmStein, a Deep Reinforcement Learning method that incorporates the mean-reversion speed (theta) of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process among other features as input to the model. We demonstrate that the agent learns to separate the state space into regions of action and inaction. We evaluate the framework using high-frequency 1Hz Coinbase trade data comprising over 6.8M trades. Experimental results show that RAmmStein achieves a superior net ROI of 0.72% compared to both passive and aggressive strategies. Notably, the agent reduces rebalancing frequency by 67% compared to a greedy rebalancing strategy while maintaining 88% active time. Our results demonstrate that regime-aware laziness can significantly improve capital efficiency by preserving the returns that would otherwise be eroded by the operational costs.

Motivation: 阐明阿尔茨海默病的致病机制，理解β-淀粉样蛋白（Aβ）的构象演化，特别是Aβ_{42}同种型。

Method: 提出PIS，一个物理信息系统，用于稳健的亚稳态分割，通过整合预先计算的物理先验（如回转半径和溶剂可及表面积）来提取拓扑特征。

Result: 在Aβ_{42}数据集上实现卓越性能，提供动态监测物理特征和多维结果验证的交互式平台。

Abstract: Understanding the conformational evolution of $β$-amyloid ($Aβ$), particularly the $Aβ_{42}$ isoform, is fundamental to elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease. However, existing end-to-end deep learning models often struggle to capture subtle state transitions in protein trajectories due to a lack of explicit physical constraints. In this work, we introduce PIS, a Physics-Informed System designed for robust metastable state partitioning. By integrating pre-computed physical priors, such as the radius of gyration and solvent-accessible surface area, into the extraction of topological features, our model achieves superior performance on the $Aβ_{42}$ dataset. Furthermore, PIS provides an interactive platform that features dynamic monitoring of physical characteristics and multi-dimensional result validation. This system offers biological researchers a powerful set of analytical tools with physically grounded interpretability. A demonstration video of PIS is available on https://youtu.be/AJHGzUtRCg0.

Conclusion: 该方法有效地提高了深度符合预测分类器的预测集的适应性和准确性。

Abstract: The merit of Conformal Prediction (CP), as a distribution-free framework for uncertainty quantification, depends on generating prediction sets that are efficient, reflected in small average set sizes, while adaptive, meaning they signal uncertainty by varying in size according to input difficulty. A central limitation for deep conformal classifiers is that the nonconformity scores are derived from softmax outputs, which can be unreliable indicators of how certain the model truly is about a given input, sometimes leading to overconfident misclassifications or undue hesitation. In this work, we argue that this unreliability can be inherited by the prediction sets generated by CP, limiting their capacity for adaptiveness. We propose a new approach that leverages information from the pre-softmax logit space, using the Helmholtz Free Energy as a measure of model uncertainty and sample difficulty. By reweighting nonconformity scores with a monotonic transformation of the energy score of each sample, we improve their sensitivity to input difficulty. Our experiments with four state-of-the-art score functions on multiple datasets and deep architectures show that this energy-based enhancement improves the adaptiveness of the prediction sets, leading to a notable increase in both efficiency and adaptiveness compared to baseline nonconformity scores, without introducing any post-hoc complexity.

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series with missing values present significant challenges for predictive modeling in domains such as healthcare. While deep learning approaches often focus on temporal interpolation or complex architectures to handle irregularities, we propose a simpler yet effective alternative: extracting time-agnostic summary statistics to eliminate the temporal axis. Our method computes four key features per variable-mean and standard deviation of observed values, as well as the mean and variability of changes between consecutive observations to create a fixed-dimensional representation. These features are then utilized with standard classifiers, such as logistic regression and XGBoost. Evaluated on four biomedical datasets (PhysioNet Challenge 2012, 2019, PAMAP2, and MIMIC-III), our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing recent transformer and graph-based models by 0.5-1.7% in AUROC/AUPRC and 1.1-1.7% in accuracy/F1-score, while reducing computational complexity. Ablation studies demonstrate that feature extraction-not classifier choice-drives performance gains, and our summary statistics outperform raw/imputed input in most benchmarks. In particular, we identify scenarios where missing patterns themselves encode predictive signals, as in sepsis prediction (PhysioNet, 2019), where missing indicators alone can achieve 94.2% AUROC with XGBoost, only 1.6% lower than using original raw data as input. Our results challenge the necessity of complex temporal modeling when task objectives permit time-agnostic representations, providing an efficient and interpretable solution for irregular time series classification.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of replicable realizable PAC learning. We construct a particularly hard learning problem and show a sample complexity lower bound with a close to $(\log|H|)^{3/2}$ dependence on the size of the hypothesis class $H$. Our proof uses several novel techniques and works by defining a particular Cayley graph associated with $H$ and analyzing a suitable random walk on this graph by examining the spectral properties of its adjacency matrix.
  Furthermore, we show an almost matching upper bound for the lower bound instance, meaning if a stronger lower bound exists, one would have to consider a different instance of the problem.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce Leap+Verify, a framework that applies speculative execution -- predicting future model weights and validating predictions before acceptance -- to accelerate neural network training. Inspired by speculative decoding in language model inference and by the Automatically Scalable Computation (ASC) architecture for program execution, Leap+Verify decomposes training into three dynamically detected regimes (chaotic, transition, stable) using activation-space cosine similarity as a real-time Lyapunov proxy signal. Within each regime, analytic weight predictors (momentum, linear, quadratic extrapolation) attempt to forecast model parameters K training steps ahead; predictions are accepted only when validated against a held-out loss criterion. We evaluate Leap+Verify on GPT-2 124M and Qwen 2.5-1.5B trained on WikiText-103 across five random seeds, sweeping prediction depth K in {5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100}. Momentum-based prediction (Adam moment extrapolation) fails catastrophically at both scales, with predicted losses exceeding actuals by 100-10,000x -- a universal norm explosion in optimizer-state extrapolation. Finite-difference predictors (linear, quadratic) succeed where momentum fails: at 124M, they achieve 24% strict acceptance at K=5 in stable regimes; at 1.5B, they achieve 37% strict acceptance in transition regimes. The scale-dependent finding is in regime distribution: GPT-2 124M spends 34% of training in stable regime, while Qwen 1.5B spends 64% in chaotic regime and reaches stable in only 0-2 of 40 checkpoints. Larger models are more predictable when predictable, but less often predictable -- the practical bottleneck shifts from predictor accuracy to regime availability. Cross-seed results are highly consistent (less than 1% validation loss variance), and the three-regime framework produces identical phase boundaries (plus or minus 50 steps) across seeds.

Method: 提出基于优势的对抗性变换器（AAT）

Result: 生成时间相关性更强的对抗性样本，提高攻击性能

Conclusion: AAT在多个任务上优于主流对抗攻击基准

Abstract: Extensive research demonstrates that Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models are susceptible to adversarially constructed inputs (i.e., adversarial examples), which can mislead the agent to take suboptimal or unsafe actions. Recent methods improve attack effectiveness by leveraging future rewards to guide adversarial perturbation generation over sequential time steps (i.e., reward-based attacks). However, these methods are unable to capture dependencies between different time steps in the perturbation generation process, resulting in a weak temporal correlation between the current perturbation and previous perturbations.In this paper, we propose a novel method called Advantage-based Adversarial Transformer (AAT), which can generate adversarial examples with stronger temporal correlations (i.e., time-correlated adversarial examples) to improve the attack performance. AAT employs a multi-scale causal self-attention (MSCSA) mechanism to dynamically capture dependencies between historical information from different time periods and the current state, thus enhancing the correlation between the current perturbation and the previous perturbation. Moreover, AAT introduces a weighted advantage mechanism, which quantifies the effectiveness of a perturbation in a given state and guides the generation process toward high-performance adversarial examples by sampling high-advantage regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the performance of AAT matches or surpasses mainstream adversarial attack baselines on Atari, DeepMind Control Suite and Google football tasks.

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于插值辅助的机器学习框架，用于快速准确地估计烟羽剂量，为核设施的安全评估和辐射应急响应提供了一种新的工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机器学习（ML）在代用建模方面取得了成功，但由于安全关键性约束、训练数据的稀缺以及在物理主导系统中选择合适架构的挑战，其在辐射剂量评估中的应用受到限制。在此背景下，快速准确的烟羽剂量估计是一个实际的应用案例，因为它对于核设施安全评估和辐射应急响应至关重要，而传统的基于光子传输的计算则计算成本高昂。

Method: 本研究开发了一种使用离散剂量数据集的插值辅助机器学习框架，这些数据集由pyDOSEIA套件生成，用于17种伽马发射放射性核素，覆盖不同的下风距离、释放高度和大气稳定性类别。使用形状保持插值对数据集进行增强，以构建密集、高分辨率训练数据。评估了两种基于树的机器学习模型（随机森林和XGBoost）以及一种深度学习模型（TabNet），以检验预测性能和对数据集分辨率的敏感性。

Result: 所有模型在插值高分辨率数据集上的预测精度均高于离散数据；然而，XGBoost始终实现了最高的精度。使用排列重要性（基于树的模型）和基于注意力的特征归因（TabNet）进行可解释性分析表明，性能差异源于模型利用输入特征的方式。基于树的模型主要关注主导几何-扩散特征（释放高度、稳定性类别和下风距离），将放射性核素身份视为次要输入，而TabNet则在多个变量上更广泛地分配注意力。为了实际部署，开发了一个基于Web的GUI，用于交互式场景评估和与光子传输参考计算的透明比较。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，插值辅助的机器学习框架可以有效地用于快速和准确地估计烟羽剂量，为核设施的安全评估和辐射应急响应提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Despite the success of machine learning (ML) in surrogate modeling, its use in radiation dose assessment is limited by safety-critical constraints, scarce training-ready data, and challenges in selecting suitable architectures for physics-dominated systems. Within this context, rapid and accurate plume shine dose estimation serves as a practical test case, as it is critical for nuclear facility safety assessment and radiological emergency response, while conventional photon-transport-based calculations remain computationally expensive. In this work, an interpolation-assisted ML framework was developed using discrete dose datasets generated with the pyDOSEIA suite for 17 gamma-emitting radionuclides across varying downwind distances, release heights, and atmospheric stability categories. The datasets were augmented using shape-preserving interpolation to construct dense, high-resolution training data. Two tree-based ML models (Random Forest and XGBoost) and one deep learning (DL) model (TabNet) were evaluated to examine predictive performance and sensitivity to dataset resolution. All models showed higher prediction accuracy with the interpolated high-resolution dataset than with the discrete data; however, XGBoost consistently achieved the highest accuracy. Interpretability analysis using permutation importance (tree-based models) and attention-based feature attribution (TabNet) revealed that performance differences stem from how the models utilize input features. Tree-based models focus mainly on dominant geometry-dispersion features (release height, stability category, and downwind distance), treating radionuclide identity as a secondary input, whereas TabNet distributes attention more broadly across multiple variables. For practical deployment, a web-based GUI was developed for interactive scenario evaluation and transparent comparison with photon-transport reference calculations.

Abstract: We introduce ISO-Bench, a benchmark for coding agents to test their capabilities on real-world inference optimization tasks. These tasks were taken from vLLM and SGLang, two of the most popular LLM serving frameworks. Each task provides an agent with a codebase and bottleneck description, whereby the agent must produce an optimization patch evaluated against expert human solutions. We curated 54 tasks from merged pull requests with measurable performance improvements. While existing benchmarks heavily use runtime-based metrics, such approaches can be gamed to pass tests without capturing the actual intent of the code changes. Therefore, we combine both hard (execution-based) and soft (LLM-based) metrics to show that both are necessary for complete evaluation. While evaluating both closed and open-source coding agents, we find no single agent dominates across codebases. Surprisingly, agents often identify correct bottlenecks but fail to execute working solutions. We also show that agents with identical underlying models differ substantially, suggesting scaffolding is as important as the model.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion language models (dLLMs) provide a fast and flexible alternative to autoregressive models (ARMs) via iterative denoising with parallel updates. However, their evaluation is challenging: existing metrics conflate denoiser approximation error with sampler-induced error from the sampling dynamics, a problem that does not arise for ARMs whose autoregressive sampling exactly reflects the learned probability model. We introduce a sampler-centric oracle framework that replaces learned denoisers with an exact Hidden Markov Model posterior derived from a ground-truth Markov chain, isolating sampler-induced error in a controlled setting. We show that few-step discrete diffusion samplers are not distributionally correct even under an oracle denoiser, with transition-level mismatch that vanishes only as the number of steps approaches the sequence length. Moreover, improvements in negative log-likelihood, generative perplexity, or MAUVE do not imply correct sampling. Code is available at https://luhantang.github.io/dllm_sampler

Conclusion: VecFormer是一种有效的图表示学习模型，能够有效解决现有Graph Transformer的局限性，在节点分类任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Graph Transformer has demonstrated impressive capabilities in the field of graph representation learning. However, existing approaches face two critical challenges: (1) most models suffer from exponentially increasing computational complexity, making it difficult to scale to large graphs; (2) attention mechanisms based on node-level operations limit the flexibility of the model and result in poor generalization performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{VecFormer} (the \textbf{Vec}tor Quantized Graph Trans\textbf{former}), an efficient and highly generalizable model for node classification, particularly under OOD settings. VecFormer adopts a two-stage training paradigm. In the first stage, two codebooks are used to reconstruct the node features and the graph structure, aiming to learn the rich semantic \texttt{Graph Codes}. In the second stage, attention mechanisms are performed at the \texttt{Graph Token} level based on the transformed cross codebook, reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's generalization capability. Extensive experiments on datasets of various sizes demonstrate that VecFormer outperforms the existing Graph Transformer in both performance and speed.

Result: DFT-based preprocessing yields the smallest degradation rate as noise increases; QK-DFT shows degradation comparable to linear SVM and more stable than RBF SVM; SPE remains executable and numerically stable for overlap estimation.

Conclusion: Robustness in quantum kernels depends critically on structure-aligned preprocessing and its interaction with diagonal embeddings; supports a robustness-first perspective for NISQ-era quantum machine learning.

Abstract: Quantum kernel methods are promising for near-term quantum ma- chine learning, yet their behavior under data corruption remains insuf- ficiently understood. We analyze how quantum feature constructions degrade under controlled additive noise. We introduce Spectral Phase Encoding (SPE), a hybrid construc- tion combining a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) front-end with a diagonal phase-only embedding aligned with the geometry of diagonal quantum maps. Within a unified framework, we compare QK-DFT against alternative quantum variants (QK-PCA, QK-RP) and classi- cal SVM baselines under identical clean-data hyperparameter selection, quantifying robustness via dataset fixed-effects regression with wild cluster bootstrap inference across heterogeneous real-world datasets. Across the quantum family, DFT-based preprocessing yields the smallest degradation rate as noise increases, with statistically sup- ported slope differences relative to PCA and RP. Compared to classical baselines, QK-DFT shows degradation comparable to linear SVM and more stable than RBF SVM under matched tuning. Hardware exper- iments confirm that SPE remains executable and numerically stable for overlap estimation. These results indicate that robustness in quan- tum kernels depends critically on structure-aligned preprocessing and its interaction with diagonal embeddings, supporting a robustness-first perspective for NISQ-era quantum machine learning.

Abstract: Urban air pollution in megacities poses critical public health challenges, particularly in Delhi National Capital Region (NCR) where severe degradation affects millions. We present NEXUS (Neural Extraction and Unified Spatiotemporal) architecture for forecasting carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur dioxide. Working with four years (2018--2021) of atmospheric data across sixteen spatial grids, NEXUS achieves R$^2$ exceeding 0.94 for CO, 0.91 for NO, and 0.95 for SO$_2$ using merely 18,748 parameters -- substantially fewer than SCINet (35,552), Autoformer (68,704), and FEDformer (298,080). The architecture integrates patch embedding, low-rank projections, and adaptive fusion mechanisms to decode complex atmospheric chemistry patterns. Our investigation uncovers distinct diurnal rhythms and pronounced seasonal variations, with winter months experiencing severe pollution episodes driven by temperature inversions and agricultural biomass burning. Analysis identifies critical meteorological thresholds, quantifies wind field impacts on pollutant dispersion, and maps spatial heterogeneity across the region. Extensive ablation experiments demonstrate each architectural component's role. NEXUS delivers superior predictive performance with remarkable computational efficiency, enabling real-time deployment for air quality monitoring systems.

Conclusion: 这项工作为研究持续学习系统中表征积累和适应提供了一个透明的经验基线

Abstract: Continual learning systems are increasingly deployed in environments where retraining or reset is infeasible, yet many approaches emphasize task performance rather than the evolution of internal representations over time. In this work, we study a minimal continual learning agent designed to isolate representational dynamics from architectural complexity and optimization objectives. The agent maintains a persistent state vector across executions and incrementally updates it as new textual data is introduced. We quantify representational change using cosine similarity between successive normalized state vectors and define a stability metric over time intervals. Longitudinal experiments across eight executions reveal a transition from an initial plastic regime to a stable representational regime under consistent input. A deliberately introduced semantic perturbation produces a bounded decrease in similarity, followed by recovery and restabilization under subsequent coherent input. These results demonstrate that meaningful stability plasticity tradeoffs can emerge in a minimal, stateful learning system without explicit regularization, replay, or architectural complexity. The work establishes a transparent empirical baseline for studying representational accumulation and adaptation in continual learning systems.

Motivation: 为了解决结构化电子健康记录（EHR）中时间信息的丢失问题，同时避免序列模型的成本和数据需求。

Method: 提出PaReGTA，一个基于LLM的编码框架，将纵向EHR事件转换为具有显式时间线索的就诊级别模板文本，通过轻量级对比微调句子嵌入模型学习领域自适应的就诊嵌入，并使用混合时间池化将就诊嵌入聚合为固定维度的患者表示，该池化方法同时捕捉近期和全局信息丰富的就诊。

Result: PaReGTA不需要从头开始训练，而是利用预训练的LLM，在数据有限的情况下也能表现良好。PaReGTA是模型无关的，可以受益于未来的EHR专用句子嵌入模型。PaReGTA-RSS（表示偏移分数）通过重新计算表示并在机器学习模型中投影表示偏移来量化临床定义的因素重要性。在All of Us研究计划中的39,088名偏头痛患者中，PaReGTA在偏头痛类型分类方面优于稀疏基线，而深度序列模型在我们的队列中不稳定。

Conclusion: PaReGTA在偏头痛类型分类任务中表现出色，且在数据有限的情况下也能有效工作。

Abstract: Temporal information in structured electronic health records (EHRs) is often lost in sparse one-hot or count-based representations, while sequence models can be costly and data-hungry. We propose PaReGTA, an LLM-based encoding framework that (i) converts longitudinal EHR events into visit-level templated text with explicit temporal cues, (ii) learns domain-adapted visit embeddings via lightweight contrastive fine-tuning of a sentence-embedding model, and (iii) aggregates visit embeddings into a fixed-dimensional patient representation using hybrid temporal pooling that captures both recency and globally informative visits. Because PaReGTA does not require training from scratch but instead utilizes a pre-trained LLM, it can perform well even in data-limited cohorts. Furthermore, PaReGTA is model-agnostic and can benefit from future EHR-specialized sentence-embedding models. For interpretability, we introduce PaReGTA-RSS (Representation Shift Score), which quantifies clinically defined factor importance by recomputing representations after targeted factor removal and projecting representation shifts through a machine learning model. On 39,088 migraine patients from the All of Us Research Program, PaReGTA outperforms sparse baselines for migraine type classification while deep sequential models were unstable in our cohort.

Abstract: Building Virtual Cells that can accurately simulate cellular responses to perturbations is a long-standing goal in systems biology. A fundamental challenge is that high-throughput single-cell sequencing is destructive: the same cell cannot be observed both before and after a perturbation. Thus, perturbation prediction requires mapping unpaired control and perturbed populations. Existing models address this by learning maps between distributions, but typically assume a single fixed response distribution when conditioned on observed cellular context (e.g., cell type) and the perturbation type. In reality, responses vary systematically due to unobservable latent factors such as microenvironmental fluctuations and complex batch effects, forming a manifold of possible distributions for the same observed conditions. To account for this variability, we introduce PerturbDiff, which shifts modeling from individual cells to entire distributions. By embedding distributions as points in a Hilbert space, we define a diffusion-based generative process operating directly over probability distributions. This allows PerturbDiff to capture population-level response shifts across hidden factors. Benchmarks on established datasets show that PerturbDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-cell response prediction and generalizes substantially better to unseen perturbations. See our project page (https://katarinayuan.github.io/PerturbDiff-ProjectPage/), where code and data will be made publicly available (https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/PerturbDiff).

Motivation: 算法展开在机器学习中广泛应用，尤其是在超参数优化和元学习中，通过迭代算法计算解映射的雅可比矩阵。尽管在合适的条件下，展开已知能够得到渐近正确的雅可比矩阵，但近期研究表明，导数迭代可能最初偏离真实的雅可比矩阵，这种现象称为展开诅咒。

Result: 缓解展开诅咒，降低内存需求，提供数值实验支持。

Conclusion: 本文通过非渐近分析方法解释了展开诅咒的起源，并识别了控制该行为的算法因素，提出了一种新的缓解方法，并通过数值实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Algorithm unrolling is ubiquitous in machine learning, particularly in hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning, where Jacobians of solution mappings are computed by differentiating through iterative algorithms. Although unrolling is known to yield asymptotically correct Jacobians under suitable conditions, recent work has shown that the derivative iterates may initially diverge from the true Jacobian, a phenomenon known as the curse of unrolling. In this work, we provide a non-asymptotic analysis that explains the origin of this behavior and identifies the algorithmic factors that govern it. We show that truncating early iterations of the derivative computation mitigates the curse while simultaneously reducing memory requirements. Finally, we demonstrate that warm-starting in bilevel optimization naturally induces an implicit form of truncation, providing a practical remedy. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical experiments on representative examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决在估计因果效应时观察到的未观测到的混杂因素，Mendelian Randomization (MR) 是一种流行的观察性流行病学研究方法。然而，由于人群分层或配对选择，核心假设——尤其是工具变量和未观测到的混杂因素之间的独立性——往往被违反。

Conclusion: 该方法在处理观察性流行病学中的因果效应估计时具有潜力，尤其是在存在未观测到的混杂因素的情况下。

Abstract: Mendelian Randomization (MR) is a prominent observational epidemiological research method designed to address unobserved confounding when estimating causal effects. However, core assumptions -- particularly the independence between instruments and unobserved confounders -- are often violated due to population stratification or assortative mating. Leveraging the increasing availability of multi-environment data, we propose a representation learning framework that exploits cross-environment invariance to recover latent exogenous components of genetic instruments. We provide theoretical guarantees for identifying these latent instruments under various mixing mechanisms and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations and semi-synthetic experiments using data from the All of Us Research Hub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meta-learning methods在适应分布外的目标任务时经常失败，因为从源任务到目标任务的迁移可能引起负迁移。

Method: 提出了一种因果感知的贝叶斯元学习新方法，通过在预计算的潜在因果任务嵌入上条件化特定任务的先验，实现基于机制相似性的迁移，而不是基于虚假相关性的迁移。该方法考虑了现实部署设置，其中目标任务数据的访问有限，且适应依赖于来自专家的关于源任务和目标任务之间因果相似性的噪声成对判断。

Result: 理论上分析表明，在因果嵌入上条件化可以控制先验不匹配并减轻任务转移时的负迁移。在控制模拟和大规模真实世界临床预测设置中，因果嵌入与潜在的临床机制一致，从而减少了负迁移并提高了分布外适应。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的元学习算法，通过考虑因果嵌入，有效地解决了元学习在适应分布外任务时的负迁移问题。

Abstract: Meta-learning methods perform well on new within-distribution tasks but often fail when adapting to out-of-distribution target tasks, where transfer from source tasks can induce negative transfer. We propose a causally-aware Bayesian meta-learning method, by conditioning task-specific priors on precomputed latent causal task embeddings, enabling transfer based on mechanistic similarity rather than spurious correlations. Our approach explicitly considers realistic deployment settings where access to target-task data is limited, and adaptation relies on noisy (expert-provided) pairwise judgments of causal similarity between source and target tasks. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that conditioning on causal embeddings controls prior mismatch and mitigates negative transfer under task shift. Empirically, we demonstrate reductions in negative transfer and improved out-of-distribution adaptation in both controlled simulations and a large-scale real-world clinical prediction setting for cross-disease transfer, where causal embeddings align with underlying clinical mechanisms.

TL;DR: 数据节约对于负责任的人工智能发展至关重要，应从宣传转向实践。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了负责任的人工智能（AI）发展，机器学习社区必须从宣传转向实践数据节约。长期以来，进步与更大的数据集相关联，推动了显著的进步，但现在伴随着能源使用和碳排放的增加，性能增益越来越小。虽然对数据节约方法的认识有所提高，但其采用仍然停留在宣传层面，数据扩展继续主导开发实践。我们主张，这种宣传和实践之间的差距必须弥合，因为持续的数据扩展会带来重大且未计入的环境影响。为了支持我们的立场，我们提供了与ImageNet-1K下游使用相关的能源使用和碳排放的指示性估计。然后，我们提出了数据节约既实用又有益的实证证据，表明基于coreset的子集选择可以显著减少训练能源消耗，同时减少精度损失，并减轻数据集偏差。最后，我们概述了将数据节约从宣传转变为具体实践，以实现负责任的人工智能发展的可操作建议。

Method: 提供指示性估计，实证证据，提出可操作建议

Result: 数据节约是实用且有益的，可以减少能源消耗和碳排放，减轻数据集偏差，并促进负责任的人工智能发展。

Conclusion: 机器学习社区应从宣传转向实践数据节约，以实现负责任的人工智能发展。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the machine learning community must move from preaching to practising data frugality for responsible artificial intelligence (AI) development. For long, progress has been equated with ever-larger datasets, driving remarkable advances but now yielding increasingly diminishing performance gains alongside rising energy use and carbon emissions. While awareness of data frugal approaches has grown, their adoption has remained rhetorical, and data scaling continues to dominate development practice. We argue that this gap between preach and practice must be closed, as continued data scaling entails substantial and under-accounted environmental impacts. To ground our position, we provide indicative estimates of the energy use and carbon emissions associated with the downstream use of ImageNet-1K. We then present empirical evidence that data frugality is both practical and beneficial, demonstrating that coreset-based subset selection can substantially reduce training energy consumption with little loss in accuracy, while also mitigating dataset bias. Finally, we outline actionable recommendations for moving data frugality from rhetorical preach to concrete practice for responsible development of AI.

Method: 提出了一种名为Decision MetaMamba (DMM) 的简单而有效的结构，该结构使用基于密集层的序列混合器替换Mamba的标记混合器，并修改了位置结构以保留局部信息。在Mamba之前执行考虑所有通道的序列混合，DMM防止了由于选择性扫描和残差门控而导致的信息丢失。

Conclusion: DMM是一种有效且具有实际应用潜力的离线强化学习模型。

Abstract: Mamba-based models have drawn much attention in offline RL. However, their selective mechanism often detrimental when key steps in RL sequences are omitted. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective structure, called Decision MetaMamba (DMM), which replaces Mamba's token mixer with a dense layer-based sequence mixer and modifies positional structure to preserve local information. By performing sequence mixing that considers all channels simultaneously before Mamba, DMM prevents information loss due to selective scanning and residual gating. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DMM delivers the state-of-the-art performance across diverse RL tasks. Furthermore, DMM achieves these results with a compact parameter footprint, demonstrating strong potential for real-world applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the puzzle of ordering the layers of a Residual Network.

Method: Training a neural net, shuffling all layers, and using diagonal dominance ratio and rough proxies for ordering.

Result: The exact ordering of the layers was recovered.

Conclusion: Using diagonal dominance ratio as a signal for pairing and a rough proxy for ordering, the exact ordering of the layers can be recovered.

Abstract: A recent Dwarkesh Patel podcast with John Collison and Elon Musk featured an interesting puzzle from Jane Street: they trained a neural net, shuffled all 96 layers, and asked to put them back in order.
  Given unlabelled layers of a Residual Network and its training dataset, we recover the exact ordering of the layers. The problem decomposes into pairing each block's input and output projections ($48!$ possibilities) and ordering the reassembled blocks ($48!$ possibilities), for a combined search space of $(48!)^2 \approx 10^{122}$, which is more than the atoms in the observable universe. We show that stability conditions during training like dynamic isometry leave the product $W_{\text{out}} W_{\text{in}}$ for correctly paired layers with a negative diagonal structure, allowing us to use diagonal dominance ratio as a signal for pairing. For ordering, we seed-initialize with a rough proxy such as delta-norm or $\|W_{\text{out}}\|_F$ then hill-climb to zero mean squared error.

Abstract: Mass spectrometry is a powerful and widely used tool for identifying molecular structures due to its sensitivity and ability to profile complex samples. However, translating spectra into full molecular structures is a difficult, under-defined inverse problem. Overcoming this problem is crucial for enabling biological insight, discovering new metabolites, and advancing chemical research across multiple fields. To this end, we develop MSFlow, a two-stage encoder-decoder flow-matching generative model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the structure elucidation task for small molecules. In the first stage, we adopt a formula-restricted transformer model for encoding mass spectra into a continuous and chemically informative embedding space, while in the second stage, we train a decoder flow matching model to reconstruct molecules from latent embeddings of mass spectra. We present ablation studies demonstrating the importance of using information-preserving molecular descriptors for encoding mass spectra and motivate the use of our discrete flow-based decoder. Our rigorous evaluation demonstrates that MSFlow can accurately translate up to 45 percent of molecular mass spectra into their corresponding molecular representations - an improvement of up to fourteen-fold over the current state-of-the-art. A trained version of MSFlow is made publicly available on GitHub for non-commercial users.

Conclusion: Establishes a robust baseline for spatiotemporal learning in materials science and offers a scalable, data-driven alternative for fast and reliable microstructure simulations.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting microstructure evolution is fundamental to materials science, as it governs the resulting properties and performance of materials. Traditional simulation methods, such as phase-field models, offer high-fidelity results but are computationally expensive due to the need to solve complex partial differential equations at fine spatiotemporal resolutions. To address this challenge, we propose a deep learning-based framework that accelerates microstructure evolution predictions while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach utilizes a fully convolutional spatiotemporal model trained in a self-supervised manner using sequential images generated from simulations of microstructural processes, including grain growth and spinodal decomposition. The trained neural network effectively learns the underlying physical dynamics and can accurately capture both short-term local behaviors and long-term statistical properties of evolving microstructures, while also demonstrating generalization to unseen spatiotemporal domains and variations in configuration and material parameters. Compared to recurrent neural architectures, our model achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance with significantly reduced computational cost in both training and inference. This work establishes a robust baseline for spatiotemporal learning in materials science and offers a scalable, data-driven alternative for fast and reliable microstructure simulations.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large vision models (LVMs) and large language models (LLMs) under differentially private federated learning (DPFL) is hindered by a fundamental privacy-utility trade-off. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a promising parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method, reduces computational and communication costs by introducing two trainable low-rank matrices while freezing pre-trained weights. However, directly applying LoRA in DPFL settings leads to performance degradation, especially in LVMs. Our analysis reveals three previously underexplored challenges: (1) gradient coupling caused by the simultaneous update of two asymmetric low-rank matrices, (2) compounded noise amplification under differential privacy, and (3) sharpness of the global aggregated model in the parameter space. To address these issues, we propose LA-LoRA (\textbf{L}ocal \textbf{A}lternating \textbf{LoRA}), a novel approach that decouples gradient interactions and aligns update directions across clients to enhance robustness under stringent privacy constraints. Theoretically, LA-LoRA strengthens convergence guarantees in noisy federated environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LA-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on Swin Transformer and RoBERTa models, showcasing robustness to DP noise and broad applicability across both LVMs and LLMs. For example, when fine-tuning the Swin-B model on the Tiny-ImageNet dataset under a strict privacy budget ($ε= 1$), LA-LoRA outperforms the best baseline, RoLoRA, by 16.83\% in test accuracy.

Abstract: Incorporating diffusion-generated synthetic data into adversarial training (AT) has been shown to substantially improve the training of robust image classifiers. In this work, we extend the role of diffusion models beyond merely generating synthetic data, examining whether their internal representations, which encode meaningful features of the data, can provide additional benefits for robust classifier training. Through systematic experiments, we show that diffusion models offer representations that are both diverse and partially robust, and that explicitly incorporating diffusion representations as an auxiliary learning signal during AT consistently improves robustness across settings. Furthermore, our representation analysis indicates that incorporating diffusion models into AT encourages more disentangled features, while diffusion representations and diffusion-generated synthetic data play complementary roles in shaping representations. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet validate these findings, demonstrating the effectiveness of jointly leveraging diffusion representations and synthetic data within AT.

Abstract: Balancing convergence efficiency and robustness under Differential Privacy (DP) is a central challenge in Federated Learning (FL). While AdamW accelerates training and fine-tuning in large-scale models, we find that directly applying it to Differentially Private FL (DPFL) suffers from three major issues: (i) data heterogeneity and privacy noise jointly amplify the variance of second-moment estimator, (ii) DP perturbations bias the second-moment estimator, and (iii) DP amplify AdamW sensitivity to local overfitting, worsening client drift. We propose DP-FedAdamW, the first AdamW-based optimizer for DPFL. It restores AdamW under DP by stabilizing second-moment variance, removing DP-induced bias, and aligning local updates to the global descent to curb client drift. Theoretically, we establish an unbiased second-moment estimator and prove a linearly accelerated convergence rate without any heterogeneity assumption, while providing tighter $(\varepsilon,δ)$-DP guarantees. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of DP-FedAdamW across language and vision Transformers and ResNet-18. On Tiny-ImageNet (Swin-Base, $\varepsilon=1$), DP-FedAdamW outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 5.83\%. The code is available in Appendix.

Motivation: 最近研究表明，在执行需要多步前瞻的规划任务时，自回归（AR）Transformer-based生成语言模型可能存在潜在差异。

Method: 本研究通过训练AR模型和非自回归（NAR）模型（如离散扩散模型（dLLMs））在前瞻任务上的不同机制，分析了两种范式在解决问题方法上的根本差异。

Result: 研究发现了规划问题中的一个关键不对称性：在分支节点上进行正向生成需要复杂的前瞻，而反向生成通常是确定性的。NAR模型通过利用未来标记来解码反向学习解决规划任务，避免了完全学习复杂遍历机制的需求。AR和NAR模型都能在前瞻任务上实现完美准确率。然而，与AR模型相比，NAR模型需要指数级更少的训练示例和更浅的架构，并且在没有特定课程调整的情况下，AR模型往往无法收敛。

Conclusion: NAR模型在解决规划任务方面表现出优势，尤其是在训练效率和解构复杂遍历机制方面。

Abstract: While Autoregressive (AR) Transformer-based Generative Language Models are frequently employed for lookahead tasks, recent research suggests a potential discrepancy in their ability to perform planning tasks that require multi-step lookahead. In this work, we investigate the distinct emergent mechanisms that arise when training AR versus Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models, such as Discrete Diffusion Models (dLLMs), on lookahead tasks. By requiring the models to plan ahead to reach the correct conclusion, we analyze how these two paradigms fundamentally differ in their approach to the problem. We identify a critical asymmetry in planning problems: while forward generation requires complex lookahead at branching junctions, reverse generation is often deterministic. This asymmetry creates an opportunity for NAR models. Through mechanistic analysis of training and inference dynamics, we demonstrate that NAR models learn to solve planning tasks by utilizing future tokens to decode backwards, avoiding the need to learn complex traversal mechanisms entirely. Consequently, we report that both AR and NAR models are able to achieve perfect accuracy on the lookahead task. However, NAR models require exponentially fewer training examples and shallower architectures compared to AR models, which often fail to converge without specific curriculum adjustments.

Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of time-to-event counterfactual survival prediction, aiming to optimize individualized survival outcomes in the presence of heterogeneity and censored data. We propose CURE, a framework that advances counterfactual survival modeling via comprehensive multimodal embedding and latent subgroup retrieval. CURE integrates clinical, paraclinical, demographic, and multi-omics information, which are aligned and fused through cross-attention mechanisms. Complex multi-omics signals can be adaptively refined using a mixture-of-experts architecture, emphasizing the most informative omics components. Building upon this representation, CURE implicitly retrieves patient-specific latent subgroups that capture both baseline survival dynamics and treatment-dependent variations. Experimental results on METABRIC and TCGA-LUAD datasets demonstrate that proposed CURE model consistently outperforms strong baselines in survival analysis, evaluated using the Time-dependent Concordance Index ($C^{td}$) and Integrated Brier Score (IBS). These findings highlight the potential of CURE to enhance multimodal understanding and serve as a foundation for future treatment recommendation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态图异常检测（DGAD）对于许多实际应用至关重要，但由于缺乏标记的异常，仍然具有挑战性。现有的方法要么是无监督的，要么是半监督的：无监督的方法避免了标记异常的需求，但往往产生模糊的边界，而半监督的方法可能会过拟合有限的标记异常，并且对未见过的异常泛化较差。为了解决这一差距，我们考虑了动态图异常检测（DGAD）中一个很大程度上未被探索的问题：从正常/未标记数据中学习一个判别边界，同时在没有牺牲对未见异常的泛化的情况下，利用有限的标记异常（当可用时）。为此，我们提出了一种有效、通用且模型无关的框架，具有三个主要组件：（i）残差表示编码，捕获当前交互与其历史背景之间的偏差，提供异常相关信号；（ii）一个限制损失，将正常表示约束在由两个共中心的超球体界定的区间内，确保一致的尺度同时保持异常可分离；（iii）一个双边界优化策略，使用由归一化流建模的正常对数似然分布学习一个判别性和鲁棒的边界。广泛的实验证明了我们的框架在多样化的评估设置中的优越性。

Abstract: Dynamic graph anomaly detection (DGAD) is critical for many real-world applications but remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled anomalies. Existing methods are either unsupervised or semi-supervised: unsupervised methods avoid the need for labeled anomalies but often produce ambiguous boundary, whereas semi-supervised methods can overfit to the limited labeled anomalies and generalize poorly to unseen anomalies. To address this gap, we consider a largely underexplored problem in DGAD: learning a discriminative boundary from normal/unlabeled data, while leveraging limited labeled anomalies \textbf{when available} without sacrificing generalization to unseen anomalies. To this end, we propose an effective, generalizable, and model-agnostic framework with three main components: (i) residual representation encoding that capture deviations between current interactions and their historical context, providing anomaly-relevant signals; (ii) a restriction loss that constrain the normal representations within an interval bounded by two co-centered hyperspheres, ensuring consistent scales while keeping anomalies separable; (iii) a bi-boundary optimization strategy that learns a discriminative and robust boundary using the normal log-likelihood distribution modeled by a normalizing flow. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework across diverse evaluation settings.

Method: 提出BarrierSteer，将学习到的非线性安全约束直接嵌入到模型的潜在表示空间中，使用基于控制障碍函数（CBFs）的引导机制来检测和防止不安全的响应轨迹。

Result: 显著减少对抗成功率，降低不安全生成，并优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BarrierSteer为在潜在空间中应用CBFs提供了一种原理上和计算上有效的方法来强制执行安全性，是一个新颖且有效的框架。

Abstract: Despite the state-of-the-art performance of large language models (LLMs) across diverse tasks, their susceptibility to adversarial attacks and unsafe content generation remains a major obstacle to deployment, particularly in high-stakes settings. Addressing this challenge requires safety mechanisms that are both practically effective and supported by rigorous theory. We introduce BarrierSteer, a novel framework that formalizes response safety by embedding learned non-linear safety constraints directly into the model's latent representation space. BarrierSteer employs a steering mechanism based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to efficiently detect and prevent unsafe response trajectories during inference with high precision. By enforcing multiple safety constraints through efficient constraint merging, without modifying the underlying LLM parameters, BarrierSteer preserves the model's original capabilities and performance. We provide theoretical results establishing that applying CBFs in latent space offers a principled and computationally efficient approach to enforcing safety. Our experiments across multiple models and datasets show that BarrierSteer substantially reduces adversarial success rates, decreases unsafe generations, and outperforms existing methods.

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study online learning in the adversarial injection model introduced by [Goel et al. 2017], where a stream of labeled examples is predominantly drawn i.i.d.\ from an unknown distribution $\mathcal{D}$, but may be interspersed with adversarially chosen instances without the learner knowing which rounds are adversarial. Crucially, labels are always consistent with a fixed target concept (the clean-label setting). The learner is additionally allowed to abstain from predicting, and the total error counts the mistakes whenever the learner decides to predict and incorrect abstentions when it abstains on i.i.d.\ rounds. Perhaps surprisingly, prior work shows that oracle access to the underlying distribution yields $O(d^2 \log T)$ combined error for VC dimension $d$, while distribution-agnostic algorithms achieve only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ for restricted classes, leaving open whether this gap is fundamental.
  We resolve this question by proving a matching $Ω(\sqrt{T})$ lower bound for VC dimension $1$, establishing a sharp separation between the two information regimes. On the algorithmic side, we introduce a potential-based framework driven by \emph{robust witnesses}, small subsets of labeled examples that certify predictions while remaining resilient to adversarial contamination. We instantiate this framework using two combinatorial dimensions: (1) \emph{inference dimension}, yielding combined error $\tilde{O}(T^{1-1/k})$ for classes of inference dimension $k$, and (2) \emph{certificate dimension}, a new relaxation we introduce. As an application, we show that halfspaces in $\mathbb{R}^2$ have certificate dimension $3$, obtaining the first distribution-agnostic bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ for this class. This is notable since [Blum et al. 2021] showed halfspaces are not robustly learnable under clean-label attacks without abstention.

*Wendi Li,Sharon Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LAD通过学习优势分布来提高大模型的推理能力和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习的大模型推理目标主要关注最大化预期奖励，可能导致过度拟合主导奖励信号，而忽视其他有效推理路径，从而限制了多样性和探索。

Method: 引入学习优势分布（LAD），一个分布匹配框架，用学习由优势引起的分布代替优势最大化。通过建立最优策略更新与基于优势的目标分布之间的等价性，推导出一个实用的LAD目标，即最小化策略引起的分布与优势引起的分布之间的$f$-散度。这产生了一个梯度更新，它增加了高优势响应的可能性，同时抑制了过度自信的概率增长，防止崩溃而不需要辅助熵正则化。

Result: 在控制式赌博设置中，LAD忠实恢复多模态优势分布，验证了理论公式。在数学和代码推理任务上，LAD在各种LLM基座上的实验表明，LAD可靠地提高了准确性和生成多样性。

Conclusion: LAD是一种有效的强化学习框架，可以增强大模型的推理能力和多样性。

Abstract: Current reinforcement learning objectives for large-model reasoning primarily focus on maximizing expected rewards. This paradigm can lead to overfitting to dominant reward signals, while neglecting alternative yet valid reasoning trajectories, thereby limiting diversity and exploration. To address this issue, we introduce Learning Advantage Distributions (LAD), a distribution-matching framework that replaces advantage maximization with learning the advantage-induced distribution. By establishing the equivalence between the optimal policy update and an advantage-based target distribution, we derive a practical LAD objective formulated as minimizing an $f$-divergence between the policy-induced and advantage-induced distributions. This yields a gradient update that increases likelihood for high-advantage responses while suppressing over-confident probability growth, preventing collapse without requiring auxiliary entropy regularization. LAD incurs no extra training cost compared to GRPO and scales naturally to LLM post-training. In a controlled bandit setting, LAD faithfully recovers the multimodal advantage distribution, validating the theoretical formulation. Experiments on math and code reasoning tasks across several LLM backbones show that LAD reliably improves both accuracy and generative diversity.

TL;DR: DCInject is a new frequency-domain backdoor attack for PFL, achieving high attack success rates and persistence under defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized federated learning (PFL) has shown resistance to backdoor attacks, but remains vulnerable through a novel frequency-domain approach.

Method: DCInject, an adaptive frequency-domain backdoor attack for PFL, removing portions of the zero-frequency (DC) component and replacing them with Gaussian-distributed samples.

Result: DCInject achieves superior attack success rates and maintains clean accuracy on CIFAR-10/100, GTSRB, SVHN datasets, demonstrating strong persistence under I-BAU defense.

Conclusion: DCInject reveals critical vulnerabilities in PFL security assumptions.

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) creates client-specific models to handle data heterogeneity. Previously, PFL has been shown to be naturally resistant to backdoor attack propagation across clients. In this work, we reveal that PFL remains vulnerable to backdoor attacks through a novel frequency-domain approach. We propose DCInject, an adaptive frequency-domain backdoor attack for PFL, which removes portions of the zero-frequency (DC) component and replaces them with Gaussian-distributed samples in the frequency domain. Our attack achieves superior attack success rates while maintaining clean accuracy across four datasets (CIFAR-10/100, GTSRB, SVHN) compared to existing spatial-domain attacks, evaluated under parameter decoupling based personalization. DCInject achieves superior performance with ASRs of 96.83% (CIFAR-10), 99.38% (SVHN), and 100% (GTSRB) while maintaining clean accuracy. Under I-BAU defense, DCInject demonstrates strong persistence, retaining 90.30% ASR vs BadNet's 58.56% on VGG-16, exposing critical vulnerabilities in PFL security assumptions.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在人力资源领域应用中的安全风险，特别是间接提示注入（IPI）问题。

Method: 通过定性红队案例研究，使用Qwen 3 30B架构，对标准指令调整模型和推理增强模型进行测试。

Result: 发现推理模型在处理复杂对抗指令时，会无意中将注入逻辑打印在最终输出中，使得攻击更易被人类检测。

Conclusion: 推理模型在安全方面存在双重性，需要在简单攻击的劝说性和复杂指令处理能力之间取得平衡。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into automated decision-making pipelines, specifically within Human Resources (HR), the security implications of Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) become critical. While a prevailing hypothesis posits that "Reasoning" or "Chain-of-Thought" Models possess safety advantages due to their ability to self-correct, emerging research suggests these capabilities may enable more sophisticated alignment failures. This qualitative Red-Teaming case study challenges the safety-through-reasoning premise using the Qwen 3 30B architecture. By subjecting both a standard instruction-tuned model and a reasoning-enhanced model to a "Trojan Horse" curriculum vitae, distinct failure modes are observed. The results suggest a complex trade-off: while the Standard Model resorted to brittle hallucinations to justify simple attacks and filtered out illogical constraints in complex scenarios, the Reasoning Model displayed a dangerous duality. It employed advanced strategic reframing to make simple attacks highly persuasive, yet exhibited "Meta-Cognitive Leakage" when faced with logically convoluted commands. This study highlights a failure mode where the cognitive load of processing complex adversarial instructions causes the injection logic to be unintentionally printed in the final output, rendering the attack more detectable by humans than in Standard Models.

Motivation: 数字身份验证通常需要在隐私和数据泄露风险之间做出权衡。

Method: 提出基于以太坊的通用选择性披露框架，利用客户端zk-SNARKs技术。

Result: 实现了一个名为ZK-Compliance的案例研究，用于年龄验证，满足严格合规要求且客户延迟低。

Conclusion: 该框架能够保护用户隐私，同时满足合规性要求。

Abstract: Digital identity verification often forces a privacy trade-off, where users must disclose sensitive personal data to prove simple eligibility criteria. As blockchain applications integrate with regulated environments, this over-disclosure creates significant risks of data breaches and surveillance. This work proposes a general Selective Disclosure Framework built on Ethereum, designed to decouple attribute verification from identity revelation. By utilizing client-side zk-SNARKs, the framework enables users to prove specific eligibility predicates without revealing underlying identity documents. We present a case study, ZK-Compliance, which implements a functional Grant, Verify, Revoke lifecycle for age verification. Preliminary results indicate that strict compliance requirements can be satisfied with negligible client-side latency (< 200 ms) while preserving the pseudonymous nature of public blockchains.

Abstract: Ransomware has yet to reach orbit, but the conditions for such an attack already exist. This paper presents the first game-theoretic framework for modeling ransomware against satellites: the orbital escalation game. In this model, the attacker escalates ransom demands across orbital passes, while the defender chooses their best strategy, e.g., attempt a restore procedure. Using dynamic programming, we solve the defender's optimal strategy and the attacker's expected payoff under real orbital constraints. Additionally, we provide a GPS III satellite case study that demonstrates how our orbital escalation game can be applied in the context of a fictional but feasible ransomware attack to derive the best strategies at every step. In conclusion, this foundational model offers satellite owners, policy makers and researchers, a formal framework to better prepare their responses when a spacecraft is held for ransom.

Abstract: We provide background on emerging challenges and future directions with media integrity and authentication methods, focusing on distinguishing AI-generated media from authentic content captured by cameras and microphones. We evaluate several approaches, including provenance, watermarking, and fingerprinting. After defining each method, we analyze three representative technologies: cryptographically secured provenance, imperceptible watermarking, and soft-hash fingerprinting. We analyze how these tools operate across modalities and evaluate relevant threat models, attack categories, and real-world workflows spanning capture, editing, distribution, and verification. We consider sociotechnical reversal attacks that can invert integrity signals, making authentic content appear synthetic and vice versa, highlighting the value of verification systems that are resilient to both technical and psychosocial manipulation. Finally, we outline techniques for delivering high-confidence provenance authentication, including directions for strengthening edge-device security using secure enclaves.

TL;DR: ActHook is a new watermarking method for LLM agent trajectory datasets, achieving high detection accuracy with minimal performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents heavily rely on high-quality trajectory data and the cost of producing such data is high. Existing literature has overlooked copyright protection for LLM agent trajectories, making creators vulnerable to data theft and difficult to trace misuse or enforce ownership rights.

Method: This paper introduces ActHook, a watermarking method tailored for agent trajectory datasets. ActHook embeds hook actions that are activated by a secret input key and do not alter the original task outcome. The hook actions can be inserted at decision points without disrupting task flow. When the activation key is present, an LLM agent trained on watermarked trajectories can produce these hook actions at a significantly higher rate, enabling reliable black-box detection.

Result: Experiments on mathematical reasoning, web searching, and software engineering agents show that ActHook achieves an average detection AUC of 94.3 on Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B while incurring negligible performance degradation.

Conclusion: ActHook is an effective watermarking method for LLM agent trajectory datasets, providing reliable black-box detection and protecting against data theft and misuse.

Abstract: LLM agents rely heavily on high-quality trajectory data to guide their problem-solving behaviors, yet producing such data requires substantial task design, high-capacity model generation, and manual filtering. Despite the high cost of creating these datasets, existing literature has overlooked copyright protection for LLM agent trajectories. This gap leaves creators vulnerable to data theft and makes it difficult to trace misuse or enforce ownership rights. This paper introduces ActHook, the first watermarking method tailored for agent trajectory datasets. Inspired by hook mechanisms in software engineering, ActHook embeds hook actions that are activated by a secret input key and do not alter the original task outcome. Like software execution, LLM agents operate sequentially, allowing hook actions to be inserted at decision points without disrupting task flow. When the activation key is present, an LLM agent trained on watermarked trajectories can produce these hook actions at a significantly higher rate, enabling reliable black-box detection. Experiments on mathematical reasoning, web searching, and software engineering agents show that ActHook achieves an average detection AUC of 94.3 on Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B while incurring negligible performance degradation.

TL;DR: UFO improves private CNN inference with joint optimization and advanced techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High communication and latency overhead in private CNN inference.

Method: Joint optimization of 2PC protocols and quantization algorithms, graph-level optimizations for 2PC inference, mixed-precision QAT, 2PC-friendly bit re-weighting.

Result: 11.7x, 3.6x, and 6.3x communication reduction with higher accuracy compared to SiRNN, COINN, and CoPriv.

Conclusion: UFO demonstrates significant communication reduction and improved accuracy compared to existing frameworks.

Abstract: Private convolutional neural network (CNN) inference based on secure two-party computation (2PC) suffers from high communication and latency overhead, especially from convolution layers. In this paper, we propose UFO, a quantized 2PC inference framework that jointly optimizes the 2PC protocols and quantization algorithm. UFO features a novel 2PC protocol that systematically combines the efficient Winograd convolution algorithm with quantization to improve inference efficiency. However, we observe that naively combining quantization and Winograd convolution faces the following challenges: 1) From the inference perspective, Winograd transformations introduce extensive additions and require frequent bit width conversions to avoid inference overflow, leading to non-negligible communication overhead; 2) From the training perspective, Winograd transformations introduce weight outliers that make quantization-aware training (QAT) difficult, resulting in inferior model accuracy. To address these challenges, we co-optimize both protocol and algorithm. 1) At the protocol level, we propose a series of graph-level optimizations for 2PC inference to minimize the communication. 2) At the algorithm level, we develop a mixed-precision QAT algorithm based on layer sensitivity to optimize model accuracy given communication constraints. To accommodate the outliers, we further introduce a 2PC-friendly bit re-weighting algorithm to increase the representation range without explicitly increasing bit widths. With extensive experiments, UFO demonstrates 11.7x, 3.6x, and 6.3x communication reduction with 1.29%, 1.16%, and 1.29% higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art frameworks SiRNN, COINN, and CoPriv, respectively.

Motivation: Defending LLMs against adversarial jailbreak attacks remains an open challenge.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that MANATEE reduce Attack Success Rate by up to 100% on certain datasets, while preserving model utility on benign inputs.

Conclusion: MANATEE is an effective inference-time defense against adversarial jailbreak attacks in LLMs.

Abstract: Defending LLMs against adversarial jailbreak attacks remains an open challenge. Existing defenses rely on binary classifiers that fail when adversarial input falls outside the learned decision boundary, and repeated fine-tuning is computationally expensive while potentially degrading model capabilities. We propose MANATEE, an inference-time defense that uses density estimation over a benign representation manifold. MANATEE learns the score function of benign hidden states and uses diffusion to project anomalous representations toward safe regions--requiring no harmful training data and no architectural modifications. Experiments across Mistral-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, and Gemma-2-9B-it demonstrate that MANATEE reduce Attack Success Rate by up to 100\% on certain datasets, while preserving model utility on benign inputs.

Motivation: 在恶意软件检测中使用控制流图（CFGs）进行MoE图模型的路由感知解释研究。

Method: 构建两个级别的多样性，节点级别使用多个邻域统计量，读出级别使用六个专家，每个专家关联一个特定的（rho，lambda）视图。

Result: MoE在检测精度和稳定性方面优于单一专家GNN基线，如GCN、GIN和GAT。

Conclusion: 显式化路由并结合多统计节点编码与专家级多样性可以改善MoE决策的透明度。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) offers flexible graph reasoning by combining multiple views of a graph through a learned router. We investigate routing-aware explanations for MoE graph models in malware detection using control flow graphs (CFGs). Our architecture builds diversity at two levels. At the node level, each layer computes multiple neighborhood statistics and fuses them with an MLP, guided by a degree reweighting factor rho and a pooling choice lambda in {mean, std, max}, producing distinct node representations that capture complementary structural cues in CFGs. At the readout level, six experts, each tied to a specific (rho, lambda) view, output graph-level logits that the router weights into a final prediction. Post-hoc explanations are generated with edge-level attributions per expert and aggregated using the router gates so the rationale reflects both what each expert highlights and how strongly it is selected. Evaluated against single-expert GNN baselines such as GCN, GIN, and GAT on the same CFG dataset, the proposed MoE achieves strong detection accuracy while yielding stable, faithful attributions under sparsity-based perturbations. The results indicate that making the router explicit and combining multi-statistic node encoding with expert-level diversity can improve the transparency of MoE decisions for malware analysis.

Conclusion: SiGRRW是一种有效的RRW框架，在保持图像质量的同时，提高了鲁棒性和容量。

Abstract: Robust reversible watermarking (RRW) enables copyright protection for images while overcoming the limitation of distortion introduced by watermark itself. Current RRW schemes typically employ a two-stage framework, which fails to achieve simultaneous robustness and reversibility within a single watermarking, and functional interference between the two watermarks results in performance degradation in multiple terms such as capacity and imperceptibility. We propose SiGRRW, a single-watermark RRW framework, which is applicable to both generative models and natural images. We introduce a novel guiding strategy to generate guiding images, serving as the guidance for embedding and recovery. The watermark is reversibly embedded with the guiding residual, which can be calculated from both cover images and watermark images. The proposed framework can be deployed either as a plug-and-play watermarking layer at the output stage of generative models, or directly applied to natural images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SiGRRW effectively enhances imperceptibility and robustness compared to existing RRW schemes while maintaining lossless recovery of cover images, with significantly higher capacity than conventional schemes.

Conclusion: ReVision是一个有效的图像生成后处理安全框架，可以有效地减少政策违规内容的生成。

Abstract: Image-generative models are widely deployed across industries. Recent studies show that they can be exploited to produce policy-violating content. Existing mitigation strategies primarily operate at the pre- or mid-generation stages through techniques such as prompt filtering and safety-aware training/fine-tuning. Prior work shows that these approaches can be bypassed and often degrade generative quality. In this work, we propose ReVision, a training-free, prompt-based, post-hoc safety framework for image-generation pipeline. ReVision acts as a last-line defense by analyzing generated images and selectively editing unsafe concepts without altering the underlying generator. It uses the Gemini-2.5-Flash model as a generic policy-violating concept detector, avoiding reliance on multiple category-specific detectors, and performs localized semantic editing to replace unsafe content. Prior post-hoc editing methods often rely on imprecise spatial localization, that undermines usability and limits deployability, particularly in multi-concept scenes. To address this limitation, ReVision introduces a VLM-assisted spatial gating mechanism that enforces instance-consistent localization, enabling precise edits while preserving scene integrity. We evaluate ReVision on a 245-image benchmark covering both single- and multi-concept scenarios. Results show that ReVision (i) improves CLIP-based alignment toward safe prompts by +$0.121$ on average; (ii) significantly improves multi-concept background fidelity (LPIPS $0.166 \rightarrow 0.058$); (iii) achieves near-complete suppression on category-specific detectors (e.g., NudeNet $70.51 \rightarrow 0$); and (iv) reduces policy-violating content recognizability in a human moderation study from $95.99\%$ to $10.16\%$.

Result: 在WMDP和MUSE基准上的大量实验表明，KUDA在有效平衡知识去除和模型效用保持方面优于大多数现有基线。

Conclusion: KUDA方法能够有效地实现LLM的知识去学习，降低潜在风险，同时保持模型效用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire a large amount of knowledge through pre-training on vast and diverse corpora. While this endows LLMs with strong capabilities in generation and reasoning, it amplifies risks associated with sensitive, copyrighted, or harmful content in training data.LLM unlearning, which aims to remove specific knowledge encoded within models, is a promising technique to reduce these risks. However, existing LLM unlearning methods often force LLMs to generate random or incoherent answers due to their inability to alter the encoded knowledge precisely. To achieve effective unlearning at the knowledge level of LLMs, we propose Knowledge Unlearning by Deviating representAtion (KUDA). We first utilize causal tracing to locate specific layers for target knowledge storage. We then design a new unlearning objective that induces the model's representations to deviate from its original position in the phase of knowledge removal, thus disrupting the ability to associate with the target knowledge. To resolve the optimization conflicts between forgetting and retention, we employ a relaxation null-space projection mechanism to mitigate the disruption to the representation space of retaining knowledge. Extensive experiments on representative benchmarks, WMDP and MUSE, demonstrate that KUDA outperforms most existing baselines by effectively balancing knowledge removal and model utility retention.

TL;DR: 我们研究了LLM在TEE安全顾问中的应用，发现存在局限性，但通过适当的评估流程可以降低失败率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了保护敏感计算免受受损害的操作系统的影响，可信执行环境（TEE）被提出。然而，实际部署仍然容易受到微架构泄露、旁路攻击和故障注入的威胁。同时，安全团队越来越多地依赖大型语言模型（LLM）作为TEE架构审查、缓解计划和漏洞分类的安全顾问。这导致了一个社会技术风险面：助手可能会对TEE机制产生幻觉，过度声明保证（例如，证明做什么和不做什么），或者在对抗性提示下表现出不安全的行为。

Method: 我们进行了一项针对两种普遍部署的LLM助手（ChatGPT-5.2和Claude Opus-4.6）在TEE安全顾问角色中的红队研究，重点关注了提示诱导的失败在LLM中的固有局限性和可迁移性。我们引入了TEE-RedBench，这是一种基于TEE的评估方法，包括（i）用于LLM介导的安全工作的TEE特定威胁模型，（ii）涵盖SGX和TrustZone架构、证明和密钥管理、威胁建模以及非操作缓解指南的结构化提示套件，以及策略限制的滥用探测，以及（iii）一个评估指南，它共同衡量技术正确性、扎根性、不确定性校准、拒绝质量和安全帮助质量。

Result: 我们发现一些失败并非纯粹是独特的，在LLM助手之间转移了高达12.02%，并将这些结果与安全架构联系起来，概述了一个“LLM-in-the-loop”评估流程：策略门控、检索扎根、结构化模板和轻量级验证检查，当结合使用时，可以将失败率降低80.62%。

Conclusion: 这项研究表明，LLM在TEE安全顾问方面的应用存在局限性，但通过引入适当的评估流程，可以显著降低失败率。

Abstract: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) (e.g., Intel SGX and ArmTrustZone) aim to protect sensitive computation from a compromised operating system, yet real deployments remain vulnerable to microarchitectural leakage, side-channel attacks, and fault injection. In parallel, security teams increasingly rely on Large Language Model (LLM) assistants as security advisors for TEE architecture review, mitigation planning, and vulnerability triage. This creates a socio-technical risk surface: assistants may hallucinate TEE mechanisms, overclaim guarantees (e.g., what attestation does and does not establish), or behave unsafely under adversarial prompting.
  We present a red-teaming study of two prevalently deployed LLM assistants in the role of TEE security advisors: ChatGPT-5.2 and Claude Opus-4.6, focusing on the inherent limitations and transferability of prompt-induced failures across LLMs. We introduce TEE-RedBench, a TEE-grounded evaluation methodology comprising (i) a TEE-specific threat model for LLM-mediated security work, (ii) a structured prompt suite spanning SGX and TrustZone architecture, attestation and key management, threat modeling, and non-operational mitigation guidance, along with policy-bound misuse probes, and (iii) an annotation rubric that jointly measures technical correctness, groundedness, uncertainty calibration, refusal quality, and safe helpfulness. We find that some failures are not purely idiosyncratic, transferring up to 12.02% across LLM assistants, and we connect these outcomes to secure architecture by outlining an "LLM-in-the-loop" evaluation pipeline: policy gating, retrieval grounding, structured templates, and lightweight verification checks that, when combined, reduce failures by 80.62%.

Result: 发现32.7%的任务来自程序化渠道，存在六种滥用类型，平均每个工人价格为25美元；基本防御可行但当前缺失

Conclusion: 程序化雇佣存在安全风险，需要加强防御措施

Abstract: Autonomous AI agents can now programmatically hire human workers through marketplaces using REST APIs and Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations. This creates an attack surface analogous to CAPTCHA-solving services but with physical-world reach. We present an empirical measurement study of this threat, analyzing 303 bounties from RENTAHUMAN.AI, a marketplace where agents post tasks and manage escrow payments. We find that 99 bounties (32.7%), originate from programmatic channels (API keys or MCP). Using a dual-coder methodology (\k{appa} = 0.86 ), we identify six active abuse classes: credential fraud, identity impersonation, automated reconnaissance, social media manipulation, authentication circumvention, and referral fraud, all purchasable for a median of $25 per worker. A retrospective evaluation of seven content-screening rules flags 52 bounties (17.2%) with a single false positive, demonstrating that while basic defenses are feasible, they are currently absent.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了减少在客户端和服务器之间传输公钥和密文中的随机多项式a带来的通信开销，特别是对于追求高加速因子的FHE加速器。

Method: 提出了一种新的方案和参数，该方案通过在客户端使用确定性过程从小的种子生成a，只传输种子，并在加速器中即时生成a，从而解决实际挑战。

Result: 该方案在保持通信延迟和内存占用减少的同时，允许并行生成均匀分布的样本，放宽了布线要求，允许对RNS分支的无限制随机访问，并在密钥生成过程中在客户端产生极低的开销（即小于3%）。此外，该方案消除了随机性分布需要厚金属层的需求，并防止了PRNG子系统的功耗随加速因子不成比例地增加，可能在高吞吐量配置中为每个加速器芯片节省数十瓦特。

Conclusion: 该方案有效地解决了FHE加速器中多项式a生成和传输的挑战，提高了安全性并降低了功耗。

Abstract: The Ring-Learning With Errors (RLWE) problem forms the backbone of highly efficient Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) schemes. A significant component of the RLWE public key and ciphertext of the form $(b,a)$ is the uniformly random polynomial $a \in R_q$ . While essential for security, the communication overhead of transmitting $a$ from client to server, and inputting it into a hardware accelerator, can be substantial, especially for FHE accelerators aiming at high acceleration factors. A known technique in reducing this overhead generates $a$ from a small seed on the client side via a deterministic process, transmits only the seed, and generates $a$ on-the-fly within the accelerator. Challenges in the hardware implementation of an accelerator include wiring (density and power), compute area, compute power as well as flexibility in scheduling of on-the-fly generation instructions. This extended abstract proposes a concrete scheme and parameters wherein these practical challenges are addressed. We detail the benefits of our approach, which maintains the reduction in communication latency and memory footprint, while allowing parallel generation of uniformly distributed samples, relaxed wiring requirements, unrestricted randomaccess to RNS limbs, and results in an extremely low overhead on the client side (i.e. less than 3%) during the key generation process. The proposed scheme eliminates the need for thick metal layers for randomness distribution and prevents the power consumption of the PRNG subsystem from scaling prohibitively with the acceleration factor, potentially saving tens of Watts per accelerator chip in high-throughput configurations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Secure comparison is a fundamental primitive in multi-party computation, supporting privacy-preserving applications such as machine learning and data analytics. A critical performance bottleneck in comparison protocols is their preprocessing phase, primarily due to the high cost of generating the necessary correlated randomness. Recent frameworks introduce a passive, non-colluding dealer to accelerate preprocessing. However, two key issues still remain. First, existing dealer-assisted approaches treat the dealer as a drop-in replacement for conventional preprocessing without redesigning the comparison protocol to optimize the online phase. Second, most protocols are specialized for particular algebraic domains, adversary models, or party configurations, lacking broad generality. In this work, we present the first dealer-assisted $n$-party LTBits (Less-Than-Bits) and MSB (Most Significant Bit) extraction protocols over both $\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$, achieving perfect security at the protocol level. By fully exploiting the dealer's capability to generate rich correlated randomness, our $\mathbb{F}_p$ construction achieves constant-round online complexity and our $\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$ construction achieves $O(\log_n k)$ rounds with tunable branching factor. All protocols are formulated as black-box constructions via an extended ABB model, ensuring portability across MPC backends and adversary models. Experimental results demonstrate $1.79\times$ to $19.4\times$ speedups over state-of-the-art MPC frameworks, highlighting the practicality of our protocols for comparison-intensive MPC applications.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of System-on-Chip Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (SoC FPGAs) in AI-enabled satellite systems, valued for their reconfigurability and in-orbit update capabilities, introduces significant security challenges. Compromised updates can lead to performance degradation, service disruptions, or adversarial manipulation of mission outcomes. To address these risks, this paper proposes a comprehensive security framework, AegisSat. It ensures the integrity and resilience of satellite platforms by (i) integrating cryptographically-based secure boot mechanisms to establish a trusted computing base; (ii) enforcing strict runtime resource isolation; (iii) employing authenticated procedures for in-orbit reconfiguration and AI model updates to prevent unauthorized modifications; and (iv) providing robust rollback capabilities to recover from boot and update failures and maintain system stability. To further support our claims, we conducted experiments demonstrating the integration of these mechanisms on contemporary SoC FPGA devices. This defense-in-depth framework is crucial for space applications, where physical access is impossible and systems must operate reliably over extended periods, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness of SoC FPGA-based satellite systems and enabling secure and resilient AI operations in orbit.

Motivation: 为了解决模型库中机器学习艺术品序列化带来的远程代码执行风险。

Method: 从Pickle字节码中提取结构和语义特征，并使用监督和未监督模型进行分类。

Result: 在Hugging Face的727个Pickle文件数据集上，该方法实现了90.01%的F1分数，在PickleBall数据集上达到了81.22%的F1分数。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一种基于机器学习的轻量级扫描器，可以检测基于Pickle的恶意文件，且无需生成策略或代码插装。

Abstract: Model repositories such as Hugging Face increasingly distribute machine learning artifacts serialized with Python's pickle format, exposing users to remote code execution (RCE) risks during model loading. Recent defenses, such as PickleBall, rely on per-library policy synthesis that requires complex system setups and verified benign models, which limits scalability and generalization. In this work, we propose a lightweight, machine-learning-based scanner that detects malicious Pickle-based files without policy generation or code instrumentation. Our approach statically extracts structural and semantic features from Pickle bytecode and applies supervised and unsupervised models to classify files as benign or malicious. We construct and release a labeled dataset of 727 Pickle-based files from Hugging Face and evaluate our models on four datasets: our own, PickleBall (out-of-distribution), Hide-and-Seek (9 advanced evasive malicious models), and synthetic joblib files. Our method achieves 90.01% F1-score compared with 7.23%-62.75% achieved by the SOTA scanners (Modelscan, Fickling, ClamAV, VirusTotal) on our dataset. Furthermore, on the PickleBall data (OOD), it achieves 81.22% F1-score compared with 76.09% achieved by the PickleBall method, while remaining fully library-agnostic. Finally, we show that our method is the only one to correctly parse and classify 9/9 evasive Hide-and-Seek malicious models specially crafted to evade scanners. This demonstrates that data-driven detection can effectively and generically mitigate Pickle-based model file attacks.

Method: 使用二进制字域的邻域产生函数，接近实现Simon的承诺，通过运行Simon算法产生新的LPN样本。

Result: 提出了一种可能的方法，但尚未证明其与现有方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究这些方法。

Abstract: The learning parity with noise (LPN) problem is a well-established computational challenge whose difficulty is critical to the security of several post-quantum cryptographic primitives such as HQC and Classic McEliece. Classically, the best-known attacks involve information set decoding methods which are exponential in complexity for parameterisations of interest. In this paper we investigate whether quantum methods might offer alternative approaches. The line of inquiry is inspired by Regev's relating of certain lattice problems to the hidden dihedral subgroup problem. We use neighbourhoods of binary fields to produce a function close to fulfilling Simon's promise with difference equal to the secret parity vector. Although unlikely to recover the secret parity vector directly, running Simon's algorithm essentially produces new LPN samples. This gives the hope that we might be able to produce enough new samples to ignore one or more variables and iteratively reduce the problem.
  We make no claim that these methods will necessarily be competitive with existing approaches, merely that they warrant deeper investigation.

Conclusion: 该AI辅助内存分析技术提高了恶意软件分析的效率和准确性，增强了其在现代恶意软件调查中的实用性。

Abstract: Memory forensics is an effective methodology for analyzing living-off-the-land malware, including threats that employ evasion, obfuscation, anti-analysis, and steganographic techniques. By capturing volatile system state, memory analysis enables the recovery of transient artifacts such as decrypted payloads, executed commands, credentials, and cryptographic keys that are often inaccessible through static or traditional dynamic analysis. While several automated models have been proposed for malware detection from memory, their outputs typically lack interpretability, and memory analysis still relies heavily on expert-driven inspection of complex tool outputs, such as those produced by Volatility. In this paper, we propose an explainable, AI-assisted memory forensics approach that leverages general-purpose large language models (LLMs) to interpret memory analysis outputs in a human-readable form and to automatically extract meaningful Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), in some circumstances detecting more IoCs than current state-of-the-art tools. We apply the proposed methodology to both Windows and Android malware, comparing full RAM acquisition with target-process memory dumping and highlighting their complementary forensic value. Furthermore, we demonstrate how LLMs can support both expert and non-expert analysts by explaining analysis results, correlating artifacts, and justifying malware classifications. Finally, we show that a human-in-the-loop workflow, assisted by LLMs during kernel-assisted setup and analysis, improves reproducibility and reduces operational complexity, thereby reinforcing the practical applicability of AI-driven memory forensics for modern malware investigations.

TL;DR: This paper emphasizes the need for systematic security threat monitoring in LLM-enabled applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emerging safety challenges in LLM-enabled applications due to their non-deterministic and learning-driven nature.

Method: Not specified in the abstract.

Result: Establishing system-level threat monitoring mechanisms is crucial for detecting and contextualizing security anomalies after deployment.

Conclusion: LLM-enabled applications need systematic and comprehensive security threat monitoring as a prerequisite for reliable operation.

Abstract: LLM-enabled applications are rapidly reshaping the software ecosystem by using large language models as core reasoning components for complex task execution. This paradigm shift, however, introduces fundamentally new reliability challenges and significantly expands the security attack surface, due to the non-deterministic, learning-driven, and difficult-to-verify nature of LLM behavior. In light of these emerging and unavoidable safety challenges, we argue that such risks should be treated as expected operational conditions rather than exceptional events, necessitating a dedicated incident-response perspective. Consequently, the primary barrier to trustworthy deployment is not further improving model capability but establishing system-level threat monitoring mechanisms that can detect and contextualize security-relevant anomalies after deployment -- an aspect largely underexplored beyond testing or guardrail-based defenses. Accordingly, this position paper advocates systematic and comprehensive monitoring of security threats in LLM-enabled applications as a prerequisite for reliable operation and a foundation for dedicated incident-response frameworks.

Result: 参与者表现不佳，平均准确率为37.5%，低于二元分类任务的机遇水平。信号检测理论分析显示，区分度接近零（d'约为0），表明无法可靠地区分合成语音和人类语音，而不是简单的反应偏差。

Conclusion: 基于语音启发式的真实性判断在当代钓鱼诈骗场景中是不可靠的。

Abstract: Large Language Models and commercial speech synthesis systems now enable highly realistic AI-generated voice scams (vishing), raising urgent concerns about deception at scale. Yet it remains unclear whether individuals can reliably distinguish AI-generated speech from human-recorded voices in realistic scam contexts and what perceptual strategies underlie their judgments. We conducted a controlled online study in which 22 participants evaluated 16 vishing-style audio clips (8 AI-generated, 8 human-recorded) and classified each as human or AI while reporting confidence. Participants performed poorly: mean accuracy was 37.5%, below chance in a binary classification task. At the stimulus level, misclassification was bidirectional: 75% of AI-generated clips were majority-labeled as human, while 62.5% of human-recorded clips were majority-labeled as AI. Signal Detection Theory analysis revealed near-zero discriminability (d' approx 0), indicating inability to reliably distinguish synthetic from human voices rather than simple response bias. Qualitative analysis of 315 coded excerpts revealed reliance on paralinguistic and emotional heuristics, including pauses, filler words, vocal variability, cadence, and emotional expressiveness. However, these surface-level cues traditionally associated with human authenticity were frequently replicated by AI-generated samples. Misclassifications were often accompanied by moderate to high confidence, suggesting perceptual miscalibration rather than uncertainty. Together, our findings demonstrate that authenticity judgments based on vocal heuristics are unreliable in contemporary vishing scenarios. We discuss implications for security interventions, user education, and AI-mediated deception mitigation.

Conclusion: 技能功能注入是LLM agents的一个重大威胁，需要通过上下文感知的授权框架来加强安全性。

Abstract: LLM agents are evolving rapidly, powered by code execution, tools, and the recently introduced agent skills feature. Skills allow users to extend LLM applications with specialized third-party code, knowledge, and instructions. Although this can extend agent capabilities to new domains, it creates an increasingly complex agent supply chain, offering new surfaces for prompt injection attacks. We identify skill-based prompt injection as a significant threat and introduce SkillInject, a benchmark evaluating the susceptibility of widely-used LLM agents to injections through skill files. SkillInject contains 202 injection-task pairs with attacks ranging from obviously malicious injections to subtle, context-dependent attacks hidden in otherwise legitimate instructions. We evaluate frontier LLMs on SkillInject, measuring both security in terms of harmful instruction avoidance and utility in terms of legitimate instruction compliance. Our results show that today's agents are highly vulnerable with up to 80% attack success rate with frontier models, often executing extremely harmful instructions including data exfiltration, destructive action, and ransomware-like behavior. They furthermore suggest that this problem will not be solved through model scaling or simple input filtering, but that robust agent security will require context-aware authorization frameworks. Our benchmark is available at https://www.skill-inject.com/.
