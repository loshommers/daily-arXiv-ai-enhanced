We propose DCInject, an adaptive frequency-domain backdoor attack for PFL, which removes portions of the zero-frequency (DC) component and replaces them with Gaussian-distributed samples in the frequency domain. Our attack achieves superior attack success rates while maintaining clean accuracy across four datasets (CIFAR-10/100, GTSRB, SVHN) compared to existing spatial-domain attacks, evaluated under parameter decoupling based personalization. DCInject achieves superior performance with ASRs of 96.83% (CIFAR-10), 99.38% (SVHN), and 100% (GTSRB) while maintaining clean accuracy. Under I-BAU defense, DCInject demonstrates strong persistence, retaining 90.30% ASR vs BadNet's 58.56% on VGG-16, exposing critical vulnerabilities in PFL security assumptions.

This qualitative Red-Teaming case study challenges the safety-through-reasoning premise using the Qwen 3 30B architecture. By subjecting both a standard instruction-tuned model and a reasoning-enhanced model to a \"Trojan Horse\" curriculum vitae, distinct failure modes are observed. The results suggest a complex trade-off: while the Standard Model resorted to brittle hallucinations to justify simple attacks and filtered out illogical constraints in complex scenarios, the Reasoning Model displayed a dangerous duality. It employed advanced strategic reframing to make simple attacks highly persuasive, yet exhibited \"Meta-Cognitive Leakage\" when faced with logically convoluted commands.

For example, Wasserstein VI (WVI) and black-box VI (BBVI) perform gradient descent in measure space (Bures-Wasserstein space) and parameter space, respectively. Previously, for the Gaussian variational family, convergence guarantees for WVI have shown superiority over existing results for black-box VI with the reparametrization gradient, suggesting the measure space approach might provide some unique benefits. In this work, however, we close this gap by obtaining identical state-of-the-art iteration complexity guarantees for both. In particular, we identify that WVI's superiority stems from the specific gradient estimator it uses, which BBVI can also leverage with minor modifications. The estimator in question is usually associated with Price's theorem and utilizes second-order information (Hessians) of the target log-density. We will refer to this as Price's gradient. On the flip side, WVI can be made more widely applicable by using the reparametrization gradient, which requires only gradients of the log-density.

In this context, the practical reliability of such reports hinges on logical quality: whether the report's claims and arguments are explicitly supported and can be trusted as a basis for downstream use, rather than merely appearing fluent or informative. However, current evaluation frameworks largely overlook this requirement. To bridge this gap, we introduce ReportLogic, a benchmark that quantifies report-level logical quality through a reader-centric lens of auditability. Specifically, ReportLogic adopts a hierarchical taxonomy that evaluates whether readers can (1) trace an on-topic report structure with a unified analytical arc (Macro-Logic), (2) understand the progression with necessary context (Expositional-Logic), and (3) verify conclusions via explicit claim--support (Structural-Logic). Based on this taxonomy, we construct a human-annotated rubric-guided dataset and train an open-source LogicJudge for scalable evaluation. We further evaluate judge robustness via adversarial attacks, showing that off-the-shelf LLM judges are frequently influenced by superficial cues (e.g., verbosity), and reasoning modes can mask broken support relations.

Building upon the decomposition of the time series, we enhance the architecture of machine learning models for better multivariate time series forecasting. To achieve this, we focus on the trend and seasonal components individually and investigate solutions to predict them with less errors. Recognizing that reversible instance normalization is effective only for the trend component, we take a different approach with the seasonal component by directly applying backbone models without any normalization or scaling procedures. Through these strategies, we successfully reduce error values of the existing state-of-the-art models and finally introduce dual-MLP models as more computationally efficient solutions. Furthermore, our approach consistently yields positive results with around 10% MSE average reduction across four state-of-the-art baselines on the benchmark datasets. We also evaluate our approach on a hydrological dataset extracted from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) river stations, where our models achieve significant improvements while maintaining linear time complexity, demonstrating real-world effectiveness.

In this work, we argue that this view is physically incomplete. We propose that intelligence is not a passive mirror of reality but a property of a physically realizable agent, a system bounded by finite memory, finite compute, and finite energy interacting with a high entropy environment. We formalize this interaction through the kinematic structure of an Observation Semantics Fiber Bundle, where raw sensory observation data (the fiber) is projected onto a low entropy causal semantic manifold (the base). We prove that for any bounded agent, the thermodynamic cost of information processing (Landauer's Principle) imposes a strict limit on the complexity of internal state transitions. We term this limit the Semantic Constant B. From these physical constraints, we derive the necessity of symbolic structure. We show that to model a combinatorial world within the bound B, the semantic manifold must undergo a phase transition, it must crystallize into a discrete, compositional, and factorized form. Thus, language and logic are not cultural artifacts but ontological necessities the solid state of information required to prevent thermal collapse.

Using dynamic programming, we solve the defender's optimal strategy and the attacker's expected payoff under real orbital constraints. Additionally, we provide a GPS III satellite case study that demonstrates how our orbital escalation game can be applied in the context of a fictional but feasible ransomware attack to derive the best strategies at every step.

Each fraction in biologically guided radiotherapy(BGRT) treated non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients records new metabolic, anatomical, and dose information. However, clinical decision making is largely informed by static, population based NTCP models which overlook the dynamic, unique biological trajectories encoded in sequential data. We developed COMPASS (Comprehensive Personalized Assessment System) for safe radiotherapy, functioning as a temporal digital twin architecture utilizing per fraction PET, CT, dosiomics, radiomics, and cumulative biologically equivalent dose (BED) kinetics to model normal tissue biology as a dynamic time series process. A GRU autoencoder was employed to learn organ specific latent trajectories, which were classified via logistic regression to predict eventual CTCAE grade 1 or higher toxicity. Eight NSCLC patients undergoing BGRT contributed to the 99 organ fraction observations covering 24 organ trajectories (spinal cord, heart, and esophagus). Despite the small cohort, intensive temporal phenotyping allowed for comprehensive analysis of individual dose response dynamics. Our findings revealed a viable AI driven early warning window, as increasing risk ratings occurred from several fractions before clinical toxicity. The dense BED driven representation revealed biologically relevant spatial dose texture characteristics that occur before toxicity and are averaged out with traditional volume based dosimetry.

Experiments on synthetic datasets show that the framework reduces physiological violation rates from 2.00% to 0.50% under constraints while offering a path to faster simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "SciML\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86PBPK\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u836f\u7269\u5f00\u53d1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3PBPK\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8de8\u7269\u79cd\u5916\u63a8\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684SciML\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ecPBPK Transformers\u3001PCDM\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5168\u91cf\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u751f\u7406\u8fdd\u89c4\u7387\u4ece2.00%\u964d\u4f4e\u52300.50%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SciML\u6846\u67b6\u5728PBPK\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While imaging modalities such as Computed Tomography provide high-quality 3D data, 2D ultrasound (2D-US) remains the preferred first-line modality for breast and thyroid imaging due to cost, portability, and safety factors. However, volume estimates derived from 2D-US suffer from high inter-user variability even among experienced clinicians. Existing 3D ultrasound (3D-US) solutions use specialized probes or external tracking hardware, but such configurations increase costs and diminish portability, constraining widespread clinical use. To address these limitations, we present Mobile Augmented Reality Volumetric Ultrasound (MARVUS), a resource-efficient system designed to increase accessibility to accurate and reproducible volumetric assessment. MARVUS is interoperable with conventional ultrasound (US) systems, using a foundation model to enhance cross-specialty generalization while minimizing hardware requirements relative to current 3D-US solutions. In a user study involving experienced clinicians performing measurements on breast phantoms, MARVUS yielded a substantial improvement in volume estimation accuracy (mean difference: 0.469 cm3) with reduced inter-user variability (mean difference: 0.417 cm3). Additionally, we prove that augmented reality (AR) visualizations enhance objective performance metrics and clinician-reported usability. Collectively, our findings suggests that MARVUS can enhance US-based cancer screening, diagnostic workflows, and treatment planning in a scalable, cost-conscious, and resource-efficient manner.

MedTS data typically exhibit two critical patterns: temporal dependencies within individual channels and channel dependencies across multiple channels. While recent advances in deep learning have leveraged Transformer-based models to effectively capture temporal dependencies, they often struggle with modeling channel dependencies. This limitation stems from a structural mismatch: MedTS signals are inherently centralized, whereas the Transformer's attention mechanism is decentralized, making it less effective at capturing global synchronization and unified waveform patterns. To address this mismatch, we propose CoTAR (Core Token Aggregation-Redistribution), a centralized MLP-based module designed to replace decentralized attention. Instead of allowing all tokens to interact directly, as in standard attention, CoTAR introduces a global core token that serves as a proxy to facilitate inter-token interactions, thereby enforcing a centralized aggregation and redistribution strategy. This design not only better aligns with the centralized nature of MedTS signals but also reduces computational complexity from quadratic to linear.

Implementation-wise, this is projected into an adaptation mechanism, typically realized as an Adaptation Manager (AM). With the advances of generative LLMs, generating AM code based on system specification and desired AM behavior (partially in natural language) is a tempting opportunity. The recent introduction of vibe coding suggests a way to target the problem of the correctness of generated code by iterative testing and vibe coding feedback loops instead of direct code inspection.\n  In this paper, we show that generating an AM via vibe coding feedback loops is a viable option when the verification of the generated AM is based on a very precise formulation of the functional requirements. We specify these as constraints in a novel temporal logic FCL that allows us to express the behavior of traces with much finer granularity than classical LTL enables.\n  Furthermore, we show that by combining the adaptation and vibe coding feedback loops where the FCL constraints are evaluated for the current system state, we achieved good results in the experiments with generating AMs for two example systems from the CAS domain. Typically, just a few feedback loop iterations were necessary, each feeding the LLM with reports describing detailed violations of the constraints.

This poses risks in clinical settings, where models must generalize across institutions, populations, and acquisition conditions. Feature disentanglement is a promising approach to mitigate shortcut learning by separating task-relevant information from confounder-related features in latent representations. In this study, we systematically evaluated feature disentanglement methods for mitigating shortcuts in medical imaging, including adversarial learning and latent space splitting based on dependence minimization. We assessed classification performance and disentanglement quality using latent space analyses across one artificial and two medical datasets with natural and synthetic confounders. We also examined robustness under varying levels of confounding and compared computational efficiency across methods. We found that shortcut mitigation methods improved classification performance under strong spurious correlations during training. Latent space analyses revealed differences in representation quality not captured by classification metrics, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each method. Model reliance on shortcuts depended on the degree of confounding in the training data. The best-performing models combine data-centric rebalancing with model-centric disentanglement, achieving stronger and more robust shortcut mitigation than rebalancing alone while maintaining similar computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6377\u5f84\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u51cf\u5c11\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6377\u5f84\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u6297\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5272\u3002", "result": "\u6377\u5f84\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u964d\u4f4e\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6377\u5f84\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

While effective in Gaussian environments, these methods degrade in the presence of clutter, which is better modeled by heavy-tailed distributions such as the Complex Elliptically Symmetric (CES) and Compound-Gaussian (CGD) families. Robust covariance estimators like M-estimators or Tyler's estimator address this issue, but still struggle when thermal noise combines with clutter.

Experimental results show that the pipeline achieves high performance in detecting and tracking players and officials, with strong precision, recall, and mAP50 scores, while ball detection remains the primary challenge. Despite this limitation, our findings demonstrate that AI can extract meaningful player-level spatial information from a single broadcast camera.

Evaluated on nine benchmarks across state-of-the-art LLMs (including LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma) and on synthetic algebraic operations (Qwen3), our approach demonstrates robust, competitive hallucination detection and cross-task generalization.

In this paper, we propose UFO, a quantized 2PC inference framework that jointly optimizes the 2PC protocols and quantization algorithm. UFO features a novel 2PC protocol that systematically combines the efficient Winograd convolution algorithm with quantization to improve inference efficiency. However, we observe that naively combining quantization and Winograd convolution faces the following challenges: 1) From the inference perspective, Winograd transformations introduce extensive additions and require frequent bit width conversions to avoid inference overflow, leading to non-negligible communication overhead; 2) From the training perspective, Winograd transformations introduce weight outliers that make quantization-aware training (QAT) difficult, resulting in inferior model accuracy. To address these challenges, we co-optimize both protocol and algorithm. 1) At the protocol level, we propose a series of graph-level optimizations for 2PC inference to minimize the communication. 2) At the algorithm level, we develop a mixed-precision QAT algorithm based on layer sensitivity to optimize model accuracy given communication constraints. To accommodate the outliers, we further introduce a 2PC-friendly bit re-weighting algorithm to increase the representation range without explicitly increasing bit widths.

In this work, we initiate a theoretical study of scaling laws for low-precision training within a high-dimensional sketched linear regression framework. By analyzing multiplicative (signal-dependent) and additive (signal-independent) quantization, we identify a critical dichotomy in their scaling behaviors. Our analysis reveals that while both schemes introduce an additive error and degrade the effective data size, they exhibit distinct effects on effective model size: multiplicative quantization maintains the full-precision model size, whereas additive quantization reduces the effective model size.

In this work, we show that fully autonomous AI analysts built on large language models (LLMs) can reproduce a similar structured analytic diversity cheaply and at scale. We task these AI analysts with testing a pre-specified hypothesis on a fixed dataset, varying the underlying model and prompt framing across replicate runs. Each AI analyst independently constructs and executes a full analysis pipeline; an AI auditor then screens each run for methodological validity. Across three datasets spanning experimental and observational designs, AI analyst-produced analyses display wide dispersion in effect sizes, $p$-values, and binary decisions on supporting the hypothesis or not, frequently reversing whether a hypothesis is judged supported.

In this paper, we show that with contemporary optimization methods and reasonable computing resources, a global optimization approach to depth from defocus is feasible. Our approach rests on alternating minimization. When holding the depth map fixed, the forward model is linear with respect to the all-in-focus image. When holding the all-in-focus image fixed, the depth at each pixel can be computed independently, enabling embarrassingly parallel computation. We show that alternating between convex optimization and parallel grid search can effectively solve the depth-from-defocus problem at higher resolutions than current deep learning methods.

Each metric is implemented as a lightweight LoRA/PEFT head on top of a shared SLM backbone, enabling hundreds of specialized metrics to run concurrently on a single GPU, deployable locally next to AI systems in a privacy-preserving and latency optimizing manner. Across content safety and hallucination benchmarks, Luna-2 matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art LLM-based evaluators while reducing inference cost by over 80x and latency by over 20x.\n  In this paper, we outline the model architecture, training methodology and report real-world empirical results on accuracy, latency, and throughput results.

We present a design-based measurement system that (i) draws daily probability samples from the impression stream using ML-assisted weights to concentrate label budget on high-exposure and high-risk content while preserving unbiasedness, (ii) labels sampled items with a multimodal LLM governed by policy prompts and gold-set validation, and (iii) produces design-consistent prevalence estimates with confidence intervals and dashboard drilldowns. A key design goal is one global sample with many pivots: the same daily sample supports prevalence by surface, viewer geography, content age, and other segments through post-stratified estimation. We describe the statistical estimators, variance and confidence interval construction, label-quality monitoring, and an engineering workflow that makes the system configurable across policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite advances in intrinsic exploration, many methods either assume access to low-dimensional states or lack task-aware exploration strategies, thereby rendering them fragile in visual domains. To bridge this gap, we present TEB, a Task-aware Exploration approach that tightly couples task-relevant representations with exploration through a predictive Bisimulation metric. Specifically, TEB leverages the metric not only to learn behaviorally grounded task representations but also to measure behaviorally intrinsic novelty over the learned latent space. To realize this, we first theoretically mitigate the representation collapse of degenerate bisimulation metrics under sparse rewards by internally introducing a simple but effective predicted reward differential. Building on this robust metric, we design potential-based exploration bonuses, which measure the relative novelty of adjacent observations over the latent space.

Effective generators must therefore balance support fidelity -- placing probability mass near the data manifold -- with sampling efficiency. Diffusion models often capture near-manifold structure but require many iterative denoising steps and can leak off-support; normalizing flows sample in one pass but are limited by invertibility and dimension preservation. We propose MAGT (Manifold-Aligned Generative Transport), a flow-like generator that learns a one-shot, manifold-aligned transport from a low-dimensional base distribution to the data space. Training is performed at a fixed Gaussian smoothing level, where the score is well-defined and numerically stable. We approximate this fixed-level score using a finite set of latent anchor points with self-normalized importance sampling, yielding a tractable objective. MAGT samples in a single forward pass, concentrates probability near the learned support, and induces an intrinsic density with respect to the manifold volume measure, enabling principled likelihood evaluation for generated samples.

While large multimodal models (LMMs) can jointly parse images and generate explanations, their tendency to hallucinate undermines trust in classroom deployments. We present Sketch2Feedback, a grammar-in-the-loop framework that decomposes the problem into four stages -- hybrid perception, symbolic graph construction, constraint checking, and constrained VLM feedback -- so that the language model verbalizes only violations verified by an upstream rule engine. We evaluate on two synthetic micro-benchmarks, FBD-10 (free-body diagrams) and Circuit-10 (circuit schematics), each with 500 images spanning standard and hard noise augmentation tiers, comparing our pipeline against end-to-end LMMs (LLaVA-1.5-7B, Qwen2-VL-7B), a vision-only detector, a YOLOv8-nano learned detector, and an ensemble oracle. On n=100 test samples per benchmark with 95% bootstrap CIs, results are mixed and instructive: Qwen2-VL-7B achieves the highest micro-F1 on both FBDs (0.570) and circuits (0.528), but with extreme hallucination rates (0.78, 0.98). An ensemble oracle that selects the best prediction per sample reaches F1=0.556 with hallucination 0.320 on FBDs, demonstrating exploitable complementarity between grammar and end-to-end approaches. Confidence thresholding at tau=0.7 reduces circuit hallucination from 0.970 to 0.880 with no F1 loss. Hard noise augmentation reveals domain-dependent robustness: FBD detection is resilient while circuit detection degrades sharply.

This research introduces a novel formulaic continuous stochastic vision layer to quantify players' visual perception from pose-enhanced spatiotemporal tracking. Our probabilistic field-of-view and occlusion models incorporate head and shoulder rotation angles to create speed-dependent vision maps for individual players in a two-dimensional top-down plane. We combine these vision maps with pitch control and pitch value surfaces to analyze the awaiting phase (when a player is awaiting the ball to arrive after a pass for a teammate) and their subsequent on-ball phase. We demonstrate that aggregated visual metrics - such as the percentage of defended area observed while awaiting a pass - are predictive of controlled pitch value gained at the end of dribbling actions using 32 games of synchronized pose-enhanced tracking data and on-ball event data from the 2024 Copa America. This methodology works regardless of player position, eliminates manual annotation requirements, and provides continuous measurements that seamlessly integrate into existing soccer analytics frameworks.

In this work, we characterize both approximation and statistical properties of neural networks with smooth activations over the Sobolev space $W^{s,\\infty}([0,1]^d)$ for arbitrary smoothness $s>0$. We prove that constant-depth networks equipped with smooth activations automatically exploit arbitrarily high orders of target function smoothness, achieving the minimax-optimal approximation and estimation error rates (up to logarithmic factors). In sharp contrast, networks with non-smooth activations, such as ReLU, lack this adaptivity: their attainable approximation order is strictly limited by depth, and capturing higher-order smoothness requires proportional depth growth. These results identify activation smoothness as a fundamental mechanism, alternative to depth, for attaining statistical optimality. Technically, our results are established via a constructive approximation framework that produces explicit neural network approximators with carefully controlled parameter norms and model size. This complexity control ensures statistical learnability under empirical risk minimization (ERM) and removes the impractical sparsity constraints commonly required in prior analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We present a controlled evaluation of synthetic augmentation for YOLOv11 across three single-class detection regimes -- Traffic Signs (sparse/near-saturated), Cityscapes Pedestrian (dense/occlusion-heavy), and COCO PottedPlant (multi-instance/high-variability). We benchmark six GAN-, diffusion-, and hybrid-based generators over augmentation ratios from 10% to 150% of the real training split, and train YOLOv11 both from scratch and with COCO-pretrained initialization, evaluating on held-out real test splits (mAP@0.50:0.95). For each dataset-generator-augmentation configuration, we compute pre-training dataset metrics under a matched-size bootstrap protocol, including (i) global feature-space metrics in both Inception-v3 and DINOv2 embeddings and (ii) object-centric distribution distances over bounding-box statistics. Synthetic augmentation yields substantial gains in the more challenging regimes (up to +7.6% and +30.6% relative mAP in Pedestrian and PottedPlant, respectively) but is marginal in Traffic Signs and under pretrained fine-tuning.

We introduced PolyFrame, our system for the MWE-2026 AdMIRe2 shared task on multimodal idiom disambiguation, featuring a unified pipeline for both image+text ranking (Subtask A) and text-only caption ranking (Subtask B). All model variants retain frozen CLIP-style vision--language encoders and the multilingual BGE M3 encoder, training only lightweight modules: a logistic regression and LLM-based sentence-type predictor, idiom synonym substitution, distractor-aware scoring, and Borda rank fusion. Starting from a CLIP baseline (26.7% Top-1 on English dev, 6.7% on English test), adding idiom-aware paraphrasing and explicit sentence-type classification increased performance to 60.0% Top-1 on English and 60.0% Top-1 (0.822 NDCG@5) in zero-shot transfer to Portuguese. On the multilingual blind test, our systems achieved average Top-1/NDCG scores of 0.35/0.73 for Subtask A and 0.32/0.71 for Subtask B across 15 languages.

This paper presents a novel, explainable, and individualized approach for stress prediction using physiological data from consumer-grade smartwatches. We develop a time series forecasting model that leverages multivariate features, including heart rate variability, activity patterns, and sleep metrics, to predict stress levels across 16 temporal horizons (History window: 3, 5, 7, 9 days; forecasting window: 1, 3, 5, 7 days). Our evaluation involves 16 participants monitored for 10-15 weeks. We evaluate our approach across 16 participants, comparing against state-of-the-art time series models (Informer, TimesNet, PatchTST) and traditional baselines (CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM) across multiple temporal horizons. Our model achieved performance with an MSE of 0.053, MAE of 0.190, and RMSE of 0.226 in optimal settings (5-day input, 1-day prediction). A comparison with the baseline models shows that our model outperforms TimesNet, PatchTST, CNN-LSTM, LSTM, and CNN under all conditions, representing improvements of 36.9%, 25.5%, and 21.5% over the best baseline. According to the explanability analysis, sleep metrics are the most dominant and consistent stress predictors (importance: 1.1, consistency: 0.9-1.0), while activity features exhibit high inter-participant variability (0.1-0.2). Most notably, the model captures individual-specific patterns where identical features can have opposing effects across users, validating its personalization capabilities. These findings establish that consumer wearables, combined with adaptive and interpretable deep learning, can deliver relevant stress assessment adapted to individual physiological responses, providing a foundation for scalable, continuous, explainable mental health monitoring in real-world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u7406\u6570\u636e\u7684\u538b\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5bf9\u751f\u6d3b\u65b9\u5f0f\u5e72\u9884\u505a\u51fa\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u538b\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u80fd\u5f88\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u8868\u7684\u751f\u7406\u6570\u636e\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u538b\u529b\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5fc3\u7387\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u6d3b\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u7761\u7720\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b16\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u6bb5\u7684\u538b\u529b\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6700\u4f73\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff085\u5929\u8f93\u5165\uff0c1\u5929\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u4e0b\uff0cMSE\u4e3a0.053\uff0cMAE\u4e3a0.190\uff0cRMSE\u4e3a0.226\u3002\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eTimesNet\u3001PatchTST\u3001CNN-LSTM\u3001LSTM\u548cCNN\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8636.9%\u300125.5%\u548c21.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2a\u4f53\u751f\u7406\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u538b\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We investigate routing-aware explanations for MoE graph models in malware detection using control flow graphs (CFGs). Our architecture builds diversity at two levels. At the node level, each layer computes multiple neighborhood statistics and fuses them with an MLP, guided by a degree reweighting factor rho and a pooling choice lambda in {mean, std, max}, producing distinct node representations that capture complementary structural cues in CFGs. At the readout level, six experts, each tied to a specific (rho, lambda) view, output graph-level logits that the router weights into a final prediction. Post-hoc explanations are generated with edge-level attributions per expert and aggregated using the router gates so the rationale reflects both what each expert highlights and how strongly it is selected. Evaluated against single-expert GNN baselines such as GCN, GIN, and GAT on the same CFG dataset, the proposed MoE achieves strong detection accuracy while yielding stable, faithful attributions under sparsity-based perturbations.

Our work is motivated by the application of dynamic predictions in the decision-making process for primary biliary cholangitis patients. For these patients, serial biomarker measurements (e.g., bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels) are routinely collected to inform treating physicians of the risk of liver failure and guide clinical decision-making. Two popular statistical approaches to derive dynamic predictions are joint modelling and landmarking. However, recently, machine learning techniques have also been proposed. Each approach has its merits, and no single method exists to outperform all others. Consequently, obtaining the best possible survival estimates is challenging. Therefore, we extend the Super Learner framework to combine dynamic predictions from different models and procedures. Super Learner is an ensemble learning technique that allows users to combine different prediction algorithms to improve predictive accuracy and flexibility. It uses cross-validation and different objective functions of performance (e.g., squared loss) that suit specific applications to build the optimally weighted combination of predictions from a library of candidate algorithms. In our work, we pay special attention to appropriate objective functions for Super Learner to obtain the most optimal weighted combination of dynamic predictions.

In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding how anxiety relates to our health, well-being, body, mind, and behaviour. This includes work on lexical resources for word-anxiety association. However, there is very little anxiety-related work on larger units of text such as multiword expressions (MWE). Here, we introduce the first large-scale lexicon capturing descriptive norms of anxiety associations for more than 20k English MWEs. We show that the anxiety associations are highly reliable. We use the lexicon to study prevalence of different types of anxiety- and calmness-associated MWEs; and how that varies across two-, three-, and four-word sequences. We also study the extent to which the anxiety association of MWEs is compositional (due to its constituent words).

We extend geometric analysis to multi-task modular arithmetic, training shared-trunk Transformers on dual-task (mod-add + mod-mul) and tri-task (mod-add + mod-mul + mod-sq) objectives across a systematic weight decay sweep. Five consistent phenomena emerge. (1) Staggered grokking order: multiplication generalizes first, followed by squaring, then addition, with consistent delays across seeds. (2) Universal integrability: optimization trajectories remain confined to an empirically invariant low-dimensional execution manifold; commutator defects orthogonal to this manifold reliably precede generalization. (3) Weight decay phase structure: grokking timescale, curvature depth, reconstruction threshold, and defect lead covary systematically with weight decay, revealing distinct dynamical regimes and a sharp no-decay failure mode. (4) Holographic incompressibility: final solutions occupy only 4--8 principal trajectory directions yet are distributed across full-rank weights and destroyed by minimal perturbations; SVD truncation, magnitude pruning, and uniform scaling all fail to preserve performance. (5) Transverse fragility and redundancy: removing less than 10% of orthogonal gradient components eliminates grokking, yet dual-task models exhibit partial recovery under extreme deletion, suggesting redundant center manifolds enabled by overparameterization. Together, these results support a dynamical picture in which multi-task grokking constructs a compact superposition subspace in parameter space, with weight decay acting as compression pressure and excess parameters supplying geometric redundancy in optimization pathways.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6574\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u666f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u548c\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u5757\u7b97\u672f\u4e2d\u6269\u5c55\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5171\u4eab\u4e3b\u5e72Transformer\u5728\u53cc\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u6a21\u52a0+\u6a21\u4e58\uff09\u548c\u4e09\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u6a21\u52a0+\u6a21\u4e58+\u6a21\u5e73\u65b9\uff09\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6539\u53d8\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u5bf9\u53cc\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4e09\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u4ea4\u9519\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u987a\u5e8f\u3001\u666e\u904d\u7684\u53ef\u79ef\u6027\u3001\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u76f8\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u5168\u606f\u4e0d\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u548c\u6a2a\u5411\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u666f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6574\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8d85\u53e0\u52a0\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u538b\u7f29\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5197\u4f59\u3002"}}

These principles reveal three novel insights: first, SGD's original design was fundamentally sound and should be inherited by MCP; second, both frameworks leave failure modes and inter-tool relationships unexploited -- gaps we identify and resolve; third, progressive disclosure emerges as a critical production-scaling insight under real-world token constraints.

To address these limitations, we present a novel system for open-domain claim verification (ODCV) that leverages large language models (LLMs), multi-perspective evidence retrieval, and cross-source disagreement analysis. Our approach introduces a novel retrieval strategy that collects evidence for both the original and the negated forms of a claim, enabling the system to capture supporting and contradicting information from diverse sources: Wikipedia, PubMed, and Google. These evidence sets are filtered, deduplicated, and aggregated across sources to form a unified and enriched knowledge base that better reflects the complexity of real-world information. This aggregated evidence is then used for claim verification using LLMs. We further enhance interpretability by analyzing model confidence scores to quantify and visualize inter-source disagreement. Through extensive evaluation on four benchmark datasets with five LLMs, we show that knowledge aggregation not only improves claim verification but also reveals differences in source-specific reasoning. Our findings underscore the importance of embracing diversity, contradiction, and aggregation in evidence for building reliable and transparent claim verification systems", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While previous works have tackled this problem, we find that SOTA methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where the model's performance drops well below the source model due to continual parameter updates at test-time. In this work, we first show that adapting only the modality fusion layer to a target domain not only improves performance on that domain but can also enhance performance on subsequent domains. Based on this strong cross-task transferability of the fusion layer's parameters, we propose a method, $\\texttt{AV-CTTA}$, that improves test-time performance of the models without access to any source data. Our approach works by using a selective parameter retrieval mechanism that dynamically retrieves the best fusion layer parameters from a buffer using only a small batch of test data. These parameters are then integrated into the model, adapted to the current test distribution, and saved back for future use.

We propose SiGRRW, a single-watermark RRW framework, which is applicable to both generative models and natural images. We introduce a novel guiding strategy to generate guiding images, serving as the guidance for embedding and recovery. The watermark is reversibly embedded with the guiding residual, which can be calculated from both cover images and watermark images.

We propose GenPlanner, an approach based on diffusion models and flow matching, along with two variants: DiffPlanner and FlowPlanner. We demonstrate the application of generative models to find and generate correct paths in mazes. A multi-channel condition describing the structure of the environment, including an obstacle map and information about the starting and destination points, is used to condition trajectory generation. Unlike standard methods, our models generate trajectories iteratively, starting with random noise and gradually transforming it into a correct solution. Experiments conducted show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the baseline CNN model.

Recent studies show that they can be exploited to produce policy-violating content. Existing mitigation strategies primarily operate at the pre- or mid-generation stages through techniques such as prompt filtering and safety-aware training/fine-tuning. Prior work shows that these approaches can be bypassed and often degrade generative quality. In this work, we propose ReVision, a training-free, prompt-based, post-hoc safety framework for image-generation pipeline. ReVision acts as a last-line defense by analyzing generated images and selectively editing unsafe concepts without altering the underlying generator. It uses the Gemini-2.5-Flash model as a generic policy-violating concept detector, avoiding reliance on multiple category-specific detectors, and performs localized semantic editing to replace unsafe content. Prior post-hoc editing methods often rely on imprecise spatial localization, that undermines usability and limits deployability, particularly in multi-concept scenes. To address this limitation, ReVision introduces a VLM-assisted spatial gating mechanism that enforces instance-consistent localization, enabling precise edits while preserving scene integrity. We evaluate ReVision on a 245-image benchmark covering both single- and multi-concept scenarios. Results show that ReVision (i) improves CLIP-based alignment toward safe prompts by +$0.121$ on average; (ii) significantly improves multi-concept background fidelity (LPIPS $0.166 \\rightarrow 0.058$); (iii) achieves near-complete suppression on category-specific detectors (e.g., NudeNet $70.51 \\rightarrow 0$); and (iv) reduces policy-violating content recognizability in a human moderation study from $95.99\\%$ to $10.16\\%$.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReVision\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u540e\u5904\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u653f\u7b56\u8fdd\u89c4\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u653f\u7b56\u8fdd\u89c4\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aReVision\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u5e95\u5c42\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Gemini-2.5-Flash\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u653f\u7b56\u8fdd\u89c4\u6982\u5ff5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7VLM\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u7a7a\u9593\u9598\u6a5f\u6a5f\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u573a\u666f\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "result": "ReVision\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u63d0\u9ad8\u57fa\u4e8eCLIP\u7684\u5411\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u51e0\u4e4e\u5b8c\u5168\u6291\u5236\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4ee5\u53ca\u51cf\u5c11\u653f\u7b56\u8fdd\u89c4\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ReVision\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u540e\u5904\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u653f\u7b56\u8fdd\u89c4\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

Preliminary version of an ongoing project that will be expanded with furhter evaluations", "summary": "We study post-calibration uncertainty for trained ensembles of classifiers. Specifically, we consider both aleatoric (label noise) and epistemic (model) uncertainty. Among the most popular and widely used calibration methods in classification are temperature scaling (i.e., pool-then-calibrate) and conformal methods. However, the main shortcoming of these calibration methods is that they do not balance the proportion of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Not balancing these uncertainties can severely misrepresent predictive uncertainty, leading to overconfident predictions in some input regions while being underconfident in others. To address this shortcoming, we present a simple but powerful calibration algorithm Joint Uncertainty Calibration (JUCAL) that jointly calibrates aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. JUCAL jointly calibrates two constants to weight and scale epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties by optimizing the negative log-likelihood (NLL) on the validation/calibration dataset. JUCAL can be applied to any trained ensemble of classifiers (e.g., transformers, CNNs, or tree-based methods), with minimal computational overhead, without requiring access to the models' internal parameters. We experimentally evaluate JUCAL on various text classification tasks, for ensembles of varying sizes and with different ensembling strategies. Our experiments show that JUCAL significantly outperforms SOTA calibration methods across all considered classification tasks, reducing NLL and predictive set size by up to 15% and 20%, respectively. Interestingly, even applying JUCAL to an ensemble of size 5 can outperform temperature-scaled ensembles of size up to 50 in terms of NLL and predictive set size, resulting in up to 10 times smaller inference costs. Thus, we propose JUCAL as a new go-to method for calibrating ensembles in classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u7b97\u6cd5JUCAL\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6821\u51c6\u96c6\u6210\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u968f\u673a\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u672a\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u968f\u673a\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aJUCAL\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u6821\u51c6\u968f\u673a\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u8d1f\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\uff08NLL\uff09\u3002JUCAL\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cJUCAL\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cNLL\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u5206\u522b\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6700\u591a15%\u548c20%\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e5\u4e2a\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u96c6\u6210\uff0cJUCAL\u4e5f\u80fd\u5728NLL\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e50\u4e2a\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6700\u591a10\u500d\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "JUCAL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u96c6\u6210\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

In Study~1, identity basins in Stable Diffusion 1.5 can be navigated using morphological descriptors -- constituent features like platinum blonde,'' beauty mark,'' and 1950s glamour'' -- without the target's name or photographs. A self-distillation loop (generating synthetic images from descriptor prompts, then training a LoRA on those outputs) achieves consistent convergence toward a specific identity as measured by ArcFace similarity. The trained LoRA creates a local coordinate system shaping not only the target identity but also its inverse: maximal away-conditioning produces eldritch'' structural breakdown in base SD1.5, while the LoRA-equipped model produces ``uncanny valley'' outputs -- coherent but precisely wrong. In Study~2, we extend this to prompt-level morphology. Drawing on phonestheme theory, we generate 200 novel nonsense words from English sound-symbolic clusters (e.g., \\emph{cr-}, \\emph{sn-}, \\emph{-oid}, \\emph{-ax}) and find that phonestheme-bearing candidates produce significantly more visually coherent outputs than random controls (mean Purity@1 = 0.371 vs.\\ 0.209, p<0.00001p < 0.00001 p<0.00001, Cohen's d=0.55d = 0.55 d=0.55). Three candidates -- \\emph{snudgeoid}, \\emph{crashax}, and \\emph{broomix} -- achieve perfect visual consistency (Purity@1 = 1.0) with zero training data contamination, each generating a distinct, coherent visual identity from phonesthetic structure alone. Together, these studies establish that morphological structure -- whether in feature descriptors or prompt-level phonological form -- creates systematic navigational gradients through diffusion model latent spaces.

Experimental results across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that ReHear effectively mitigates error propagation, consistently outperforming both supervised and pseudo-labeling baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReHear\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7cbe\u70bc\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u97f3\u9891\u611f\u77e5LLM\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u76d1\u7763\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u786e\u8ba4\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReHear\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u6e90\u97f3\u9891\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6062\u590d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8f6c\u5f55\u6587\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cReHear\u6709\u6548\u5730\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "ReHear\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7cbe\u70bc\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6210\u679c\u3002"}}

We study whether sub-city price indices can be forecasted at weekly frequency by combining physical development signals from satellite radar with market narratives from news text. Using over 350,000 transactions from Dubai Land Department (2015-2025), we construct weekly price indices for 19 sub-city regions and evaluate forecasts from 2 to 34 weeks ahead. Our framework fuses regional transaction history with Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter, news sentiment combining lexical tone and semantic embeddings, and macroeconomic context. Results are strongly horizon dependent: at horizons up to 10 weeks, price history alone matches multimodal configurations, but beyond 14 weeks sentiment and SAR become critical. At long horizons (26-34 weeks), the full multimodal model reduces mean absolute error from 4.48 to 2.93 (35% reduction), with gains statistically significant across regions. Nonparametric learners consistently outperform deep architectures in this data regime. These findings establish benchmarks for weekly sub-city index forecasting and demonstrate that remote sensing and news sentiment materially improve predictability at strategically relevant horizons.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9065\u611f\u3001\u65b0\u95fb\u60c5\u7eea\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6b21\u57ce\u5e02\u623f\u4ef7\u6307\u6570\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u536b\u661f\u96f7\u8fbe\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53d1\u5c55\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u65b0\u95fb\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u53d9\u8ff0\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u57ce\u5e02\u4ee5\u4e0b\u533a\u57df\u7684\u623f\u4ef7\u6307\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8fea\u62dc\u571f\u5730\u7ba1\u7406\u5c40\u7684\u8d85\u8fc7350,000\u7b14\u4ea4\u6613\u6570\u636e\uff082015-2025\u5e74\uff09\uff0c\u6784\u5efa19\u4e2a\u6b21\u57ce\u5e02\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6bcf\u5468\u4ef7\u683c\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f302\u81f334\u5468\u524d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5468\u671f\u4e3a10\u5468\u4ee5\u5185\uff0c\u4ec5\u4ef7\u683c\u5386\u53f2\u5373\u53ef\u5339\u914d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f46\u8d85\u8fc714\u5468\uff0c\u60c5\u7eea\u548cSAR\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5728\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0826-34\u5468\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u5168\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4ece4.48\u964d\u4f4e\u52302.93\uff0835%\u964d\u4f4e\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u4e2a\u5730\u533a\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u6bcf\u5468\u6b21\u57ce\u5e02\u6307\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u9065\u611f\u65b0\u95fb\u60c5\u7eea\u5728\u6218\u7565\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9065\u611f\u3001\u65b0\u95fb\u60c5\u7eea\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6b21\u57ce\u5e02\u623f\u4ef7\u6307\u6570\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Submitted to COLT 2026. Extended version", "summary": "We study a sequential prediction problem in which an adversary is allowed to inject arbitrarily many adversarial instances in a stream of i.i.d.\\ instances, but at each round, the learner may also \\emph{abstain} from making a prediction without incurring any penalty if the instance was indeed corrupted. This semi-adversarial setting naturally sits between the classical stochastic case with i.i.d.\\ instances for which function classes with finite VC dimension are learnable; and the adversarial case with arbitrary instances, known to be significantly more restrictive. For this problem, Goel et al. (2023) showed that, if the learner knows the distribution $\u03bc$ of clean samples in advance, learning can be achieved for all VC classes without restrictions on adversary corruptions. This is, however, a strong assumption in both theory and practice: a natural question is whether similar learning guarantees can be achieved without prior distributional knowledge, as is standard in classical learning frameworks (e.g., PAC learning or asymptotic consistency) and other non-i.i.d.\\ models (e.g., smoothed online learning). We therefore focus on the distribution-free setting where $\u03bc$ is \\emph{unknown} and propose an algorithm \\textsc{AbstainBoost} based on a boosting procedure of weak learners, which guarantees sublinear error for general VC classes in \\emph{distribution-free} abstention learning for oblivious adversaries. These algorithms also enjoy similar guarantees for adaptive adversaries, for structured function classes including linear classifiers. These results are complemented with corresponding lower bounds, which reveal an interesting polynomial trade-off between misclassification error and number of erroneous abstentions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5AbstainBoost\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u5206\u5e03\u653e\u5f03\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u9488\u5bf9\u65e0\u77e5\u7684\u5bf9\u624b\uff09\u4e2d\u4e3a\u4e00\u822cVC\u7c7b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5bf9\u624b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\uff08i.i.d.\uff09\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6d41\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u56de\u5408\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u505a\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u53d7\u5230\u4efb\u4f55\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u786e\u5b9e\u88ab\u7834\u574f\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u534a\u5bf9\u6297\u8bbe\u7f6e\u81ea\u7136\u4f4d\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u968f\u673a\u60c5\u51b5\uff08i.i.d.\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff09\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u60c5\u51b5\uff08\u4efb\u610f\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002", "method": "Goel\u7b49\u4eba\uff082023\u5e74\uff09\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u4e8b\u5148\u77e5\u9053\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u03bc\uff0c\u5219\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u6240\u6709VC\u7c7b\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u7834\u574f\u65bd\u52a0\u9650\u5236\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u90fd\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5173\u6ce8\u65e0\u5206\u5e03\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u03bc\u662f\u672a\u77e5\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f31\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5AbstainBoost\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u5206\u5e03\u653e\u5f03\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u9488\u5bf9\u65e0\u77e5\u7684\u5bf9\u624b\uff09\u4e2d\u4e3a\u4e00\u822cVC\u7c7b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "AbstainBoost\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u5206\u5e03\u653e\u5f03\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u9488\u5bf9\u65e0\u77e5\u7684\u5bf9\u624b\uff09\u4e2d\u4e3a\u4e00\u822cVC\u7c7b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u624b\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff09\u4e5f\u4eab\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u653e\u5f03\u6b21\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5AbstainBoost\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u5206\u5e03\u653e\u5f03\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u9488\u5bf9\u65e0\u77e5\u7684\u5bf9\u624b\uff09\u4e2d\u4e3a\u4e00\u822cVC\u7c7b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u653e\u5f03\u6b21\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

We evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs, including Gemini-2.5-Pro, Gemini-2.5-Flash and Qwen-VL-Max, using this benchmark and find that none of these models perform strongly enough to be used as an assistant for this task. Our benchmark encompasses diverse datasets spanning multiple behavioral paradigms including social interactions, grooming, scratching, and freezing behaviors, with videos ranging from 10 minutes to 35 minutes in length. We provide two benchmark versions to accommodate varying model capabilities and establish standardized evaluation metrics including second-wise accuracy, macro F1, mean average precision, mutual information, and Matthew's correlation coefficient.

Despite its success, many existing RAG systems are built based on a ranking-centric, asymmetric dependency paradigm, where the generation quality of the generator is highly dependent on reranking results of the reranker. To overcome this limitation, we reformulate RAG as a cooperative multi-agent decision-making problem and propose Cooperative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CoRAG), a framework in which the reranker and the generator act as peer decision-makers rather than being connected through an asymmetric dependency pipeline. By jointly optimizing their behaviors toward a shared task objective, the reranker and generator are encouraged to cooperate, ensuring that document reranking and generation work in concert to improve the final response.

This paradigm has been extraordinarily successful for well-defined tasks where goals are fixed and evaluation criteria are explicit. However, if artificial systems are to move toward true autonomy-operating over long horizons and across evolving contexts-objectives may become ill-defined, shifting, or entirely absent. In such settings, a fundamental question emerges: in the absence of an explicit objective function, how can a system determine whether its ongoing internal dynamics are productive or pathological? And how should it regulate structural change without external supervision? In this work, we propose a dynamical framework for learning without an explicit objective. Instead of minimizing external error signals, the system evaluates the intrinsic health of its own internal dynamics and regulates structural plasticity accordingly. We introduce a two-timescale architecture that separates fast state evolution from slow structural adaptation, coupled through an internally generated stress variable that accumulates evidence of persistent dynamical dysfunction. Structural modification is then triggered not continuously, but as a state-dependent event. Through a minimal toy model, we demonstrate that this stress-regulated mechanism produces temporally segmented, self-organized learning episodes without reliance on externally defined goals. Our results suggest a possible route toward autonomous learning systems capable of self-assessment and internally regulated structural reorganization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u538b\u529b\u8c03\u8282\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982\u4f55\u786e\u5b9a\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u662f\u5426\u5065\u5eb7\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5916\u90e8\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8c03\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u5185\u90e8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u538b\u529b\u53d8\u91cf\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u8eab\u5185\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u9700\u8981\u8c03\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\u5851\u6027\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u5feb\u901f\u72b6\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u4e0e\u6162\u901f\u7ed3\u6784\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u5f00\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u5185\u90e8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u538b\u529b\u53d8\u91cf\u8026\u5408\u3002\u7ed3\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u4e0d\u662f\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u6839\u636e\u72b6\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u73a9\u5177\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u538b\u529b\u8c03\u8282\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u6bb5\u7684\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u4e00\u6761\u901a\u5f80\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u8c03\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u7ec4\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9053\u8def\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This gap is largely caused by a systemic failure in training paradigms, which lack large-scale, procedurally coherent data. To address this problem, we introduce TPRU, a large-scale dataset sourced from diverse embodied scenarios such as robotic manipulation and GUI navigation. TPRU is systematically designed to cultivate temporal reasoning through three complementary tasks: Temporal Reordering, Next-Frame Prediction, and Previous-Frame Review. A key feature is the inclusion of challenging negative samples, compelling models to transition from passive observation to active, cross-modal validation. We leverage TPRU with a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methodology, specifically targeting the enhancement of resource-efficient models. Experiments show our approach yields dramatic gains: on our manually curated TPRU-Test, the accuracy of TPRU-7B soars from 50.33\\% to 75.70\\%, a state-of-the-art result that significantly outperforms vastly larger baselines, including GPT-4o.

The FloralSix dataset, comprising 2,816 high-resolution photos of six different flower species, is also introduced. It is annotated for both dense (clustered) and sparse (isolated) scenarios. The models were evaluated using Precision, Recall, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) at IoU thresholds of 0.5 (mAP@0.5) and 0.5-0.95 (mAP@0.5:0.95). In SISBB, YOLOv8m (SGD) achieved the best results with Precision 0.956, Recall 0.951, mAP@0.5 0.978, and mAP@0.5:0.95 0.865, illustrating strong accuracy in detecting isolated flowers.

While this endows LLMs with strong capabilities in generation and reasoning, it amplifies risks associated with sensitive, copyrighted, or harmful content in training data.LLM unlearning, which aims to remove specific knowledge encoded within models, is a promising technique to reduce these risks. However, existing LLM unlearning methods often force LLMs to generate random or incoherent answers due to their inability to alter the encoded knowledge precisely. To achieve effective unlearning at the knowledge level of LLMs, we propose Knowledge Unlearning by Deviating representAtion (KUDA). We first utilize causal tracing to locate specific layers for target knowledge storage. We then design a new unlearning objective that induces the model's representations to deviate from its original position in the phase of knowledge removal, thus disrupting the ability to associate with the target knowledge. To resolve the optimization conflicts between forgetting and retention, we employ a relaxation null-space projection mechanism to mitigate the disruption to the representation space of retaining knowledge. Extensive experiments on representative benchmarks, WMDP and MUSE, demonstrate that KUDA outperforms most existing baselines by effectively balancing knowledge removal and model utility retention.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faKUDA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0LLM\u77e5\u8bc6\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u654f\u611f\u3001\u7248\u6743\u6216\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LLM\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "KUDA\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76ee\u6807\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b58\u50a8\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u79fb\u9664\u9636\u6bb5\u504f\u79bb\u5176\u539f\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7834\u574f\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u677e\u5f1b\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u6295\u5f71\u673a\u5236\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7834\u574f\u3002", "result": "\u5728WMDP\u548cMUSE\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cKUDA\u5728\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u77e5\u8bc6\u53bb\u9664\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u4fdd\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "KUDA\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0LLM\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u3002"}}

While substantial research has focused on architectural improvements, the impact of patch size, a crucial initial design choice in ViTs, remains underexplored, particularly in medical domains where both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) imaging modalities exist.\n  In this study, using 12 medical imaging datasets from various imaging modalities (including seven 2D and five 3D datasets), we conduct a thorough evaluation of how different patch sizes affect ViT classification performance. Using a single graphical processing unit (GPU) and a range of patch sizes (1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28), we fine-tune ViT models and observe consistent improvements in classification performance with smaller patch sizes (1, 2, and 4), which achieve the best results across nearly all datasets. More specifically, our results indicate improvements in balanced accuracy of up to 12.78% for 2D datasets (patch size 2 vs. 28) and up to 23.78% for 3D datasets (patch size 1 vs. 14), at the cost of increased computational expense. Moreover, by applying a straightforward ensemble strategy that fuses the predictions of the models trained with patch sizes 1, 2, and 4, we demonstrate a further boost in performance in most cases, especially for the 2D datasets.

The benchmark is constructed through a rigorous native-speaker-driven process to ensure linguistic naturalness, fluency, and cultural authenticity while minimizing translation-induced artifacts. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of both open-weight and commercial LLMs to examine challenges in Burmese modeling arising from limited pretraining coverage, rich morphology, and syntactic variation.

However, existing benchmarks remain insufficient for rigorously assessing their constrained reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MapTab, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate constrained reasoning in MLLMs via route planning tasks. MapTab requires MLLMs to perceive and ground visual cues from map images alongside route attributes (e.g., Time, Price) from structured tabular data. The benchmark encompasses two scenarios: Metromap, covering metro networks in 160 cities across 52 countries, and Travelmap, depicting 168 representative tourist attractions from 19 countries. In total, MapTab comprises 328 images, 196,800 route planning queries, and 3,936 QA queries, all incorporating 4 key constraints: Time, Price, Comfort, and Reliability. Extensive evaluations across 15 representative MLLMs reveal that current models face substantial challenges in constrained multimodal reasoning. Notably, under conditions of limited visual perception, multimodal collaboration often underperforms compared to unimodal approaches. We believe MapTab provides a challenging and realistic testbed to advance the systematic evaluation of MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We instantiate HDPCG along two concrete directions.

Direction-Time augments geometry with temporal dynamics via time-expanded graphs, capturing action semantics and conflict rules.

Large-scale experiments across diverse settings validate the integrity of our problem formulation and the effectiveness of our methods on playability, structure, style, robustness, and efficiency.

These methods, while often more flexible, introduce additional complexity: they depend on carefully chosen models, prompts, parameters, and evaluation strategies, making the evaluation process prone to misconfiguration and bias. In this work, we present EvalSense, a flexible, extensible framework for constructing domain-specific evaluation suites for LLMs. EvalSense provides out-of-the-box support for a broad range of model providers and evaluation strategies, and assists users in selecting and deploying suitable evaluation methods for their specific use-cases. This is achieved through two unique components: (1) an interactive guide aiding users in evaluation method selection and (2) automated meta-evaluation tools that assess the reliability of different evaluation approaches using perturbed data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EvalSense in a case study involving the generation of clinical notes from unstructured doctor-patient dialogues, using a popular open dataset.

We introduce a controlled diagnostic that isolates reranking by using Multi-News clusters as fixed evidence pools. We limit each pool to exactly eight documents and pass identical inputs to all rankers. Within this setup, BM25 and MMR serve as interpretable reference points for lexical matching and diversity optimization. Across 345 clusters, we find that redundancy patterns vary by model: one LLM implicitly diversifies at larger selection budgets, while another increases redundancy. In contrast, LLMs underperform on lexical coverage at small selection budgets. As a result, LLM rankings diverge substantially from both baselines rather than consistently approximating either strategy. By eliminating retrieval variance, we can attribute these differences directly to the ranking policy.

Further, to handle complex think-with-grounding reasoning for various kinds of data,we propose TwG-GRPO algorithm which features the fine-grained grounding reward, self-confirmed pseudo reward and accuracy-gated mechanism.Finally,we propose to construct a new TwG-51K dataset that facilitates training.

The problem is none of these provide a structural guarantee against forgetting. In this work, we propose Non-Interfering Weight Fields (NIWF), a framework that replaces the fixed weight paradigm with a learned function that generates weight configurations on demand from a continuous capability coordinate space. After training on a task, we commit the occupied coordinate region by snapshotting the fields outputs on anchor points to enforce a functional lock during all future training.

A significant component of the RLWE public key and ciphertext of the form $(b,a)$ is the uniformly random polynomial $a \\in R_q$ . While essential for security, the communication overhead of transmitting $a$ from client to server, and inputting it into a hardware accelerator, can be substantial, especially for FHE accelerators aiming at high acceleration factors. A known technique in reducing this overhead generates $a$ from a small seed on the client side via a deterministic process, transmits only the seed, and generates $a$ on-the-fly within the accelerator. Challenges in the hardware implementation of an accelerator include wiring (density and power), compute area, compute power as well as flexibility in scheduling of on-the-fly generation instructions. This extended abstract proposes a concrete scheme and parameters wherein these practical challenges are addressed. We detail the benefits of our approach, which maintains the reduction in communication latency and memory footprint, while allowing parallel generation of uniformly distributed samples, relaxed wiring requirements, unrestricted randomaccess to RNS limbs, and results in an extremely low overhead on the client side (i.e. less than 3%) during the key generation process.

However, indiscriminate editing risks disrupting the rich implicit knowledge encoded in pre-trained LVLMs, leading to a fundamental question: how much intervention is necessary at each layer to suppress hallucinations while preserving pre-trained knowledge? To address this question, we present a systematic analysis of LVLM decoders built on three widely used large language model backbones-Qwen, LLaMA, and Vicuna-revealing clear layer-wise differences in susceptibility to object hallucination. Building on these insights, we introduce the Hallucination Insensitivity Score (HIS), a principled metric that quantifies each layer's sensitivity to hallucination and provides guidance for targeted intervention. Leveraging HIS, we propose Hallucination Insensitivity Model Editing (HIME), a simple yet effective layer-adaptive weight editing approach that selectively modifies latent features to suppress hallucinations while preserving pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIME reduces hallucinations by an average of 61.8% across open-ended generation benchmarks, including CHAIR, MME, and GPT-4V-aided evaluation, without introducing additional parameters, inference-time latency, or computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5HIME\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236LVLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80cc\u9aa8\uff08Qwen\u3001LLaMA\u548cVicuna\uff09\u7684LVLM\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5f97\u5206\uff08HIS\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\uff08HIME\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "HIME\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8661.8%\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ca1\u6709\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "HIME\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6291\u5236LVLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e3aLVLMs\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

These include visual variations such as background changes and distractors that are irrelevant to the task being solved. We address this limitation by augmenting the predictive objective with a bisimulation encoder that enforces control-relevant state equivalence, mapping states with similar transition dynamics to nearby latent states while limiting contributions from slow features. We evaluate our model on a simple navigation task under different test-time background changes and visual distractors. Across all benchmarks, our model consistently improves robustness to slow features while operating in a reduced latent space, up to 10x smaller than that of DINO-WM.

Existing approaches tightly couple tool execution with stepwise language reasoning or explicit planning, leading to brittle behavior and high execution overhead. To overcome these limitations, we revisit tool invocation from the perspective of tool orchestration. Our key insight is that effective orchestration does not require precise dependency graphs or fine-grained planning. Instead, a coarse-grained layer structure suffices to provide global guidance, while execution-time errors can be corrected locally. Specifically, we model tool orchestration as learning a layered execution structure that captures high-level tool dependencies, inducing layer-wise execution through context constraints. To handle execution-time failures, we introduce a schema-aware reflective correction mechanism that detects and repairs errors locally. This design confines errors to individual tool calls and avoids re-planning entire execution trajectories. This structured execution paradigm enables a lightweight and reusable orchestration component for agentic systems. Experimental results show that our approach achieves robust tool execution while reducing execution complexity and overhead.

We model these dynamics using simplified differential equations that characterize the trajectory and prove stage-wise convergence results.

Evidence may span the full series or appear in a few short intervals, so the model must decide what to inspect. Most existing approaches encode the entire time series into a fixed representation before inference, regardless of whether or not the entire sequence is relevant. We introduce ARTIST, which formulates time-series reasoning as a sequential decision problem. ARTIST interleaves reasoning with adaptive temporal segment selection. It adopts a controller-reasoner architecture and uses reinforcement learning to train the controller role to select informative segments and the reasoner role to generate segment-conditioned reasoning traces and final answers. During inference, the model actively acquires task-relevant information instead of relying on a static summary of the full sequence. We use a novel hierarchical policy optimization approach for post-training that allows the model to excel in both segment selection and question-answering behavior. We evaluate ARTIST on six time-series reasoning benchmarks and compare it with large language models, vision-language models, and prior time-series reasoning systems.

Yet prior work has typically prompted models explicitly to act in specific ways, leaving unclear whether observed behaviors reflect instruction-following capabilities vs underlying model preferences. Here we test whether this precondition for misalignment is present. Using entity preferences as a behavioral probe, we measure whether stated preferences predict downstream behavior in five frontier LLMs across three domains: donation advice, refusal behavior, and task performance. Conceptually replicating prior work, we first confirm that all five models show highly consistent preferences across two independent measurement methods. We then test behavioral consequences in a simulated user environment. We find that all five models give preference-aligned donation advice. All five models also show preference-correlated refusal patterns when asked to recommend donations, refusing more often for less-preferred entities. All preference-related behaviors that we observe here emerge without instructions to act on preferences. Results for task performance are mixed: on a question-answering benchmark (BoolQ), two models show small but significant accuracy differences favoring preferred entities; one model shows the opposite pattern; and two models show no significant relationship. On complex agentic tasks, we find no evidence of preference-driven performance differences.

A critical performance bottleneck in comparison protocols is their preprocessing phase, primarily due to the high cost of generating the necessary correlated randomness. Recent frameworks introduce a passive, non-colluding dealer to accelerate preprocessing. However, two key issues still remain. First, existing dealer-assisted approaches treat the dealer as a drop-in replacement for conventional preprocessing without redesigning the comparison protocol to optimize the online phase. Second, most protocols are specialized for particular algebraic domains, adversary models, or party configurations, lacking broad generality. In this work, we present the first dealer-assisted $n$-party LTBits (Less-Than-Bits) and MSB (Most Significant Bit) extraction protocols over both $\\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$, achieving perfect security at the protocol level. By fully exploiting the dealer's capability to generate rich correlated randomness, our $\\mathbb{F}_p$ construction achieves constant-round online complexity and our $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$ construction achieves $O(\\log_n k)$ rounds with tunable branching factor. All protocols are formulated as black-box constructions via an extended ABB model, ensuring portability across MPC backends and adversary models.

We extend the soft-matching distance to a partial optimal transport setting that allows some neurons to remain unmatched, yielding rotation-sensitive but robust correspondences. This partial soft-matching distance provides theoretical advantages -- relaxing strict mass conservation while maintaining interpretable transport costs -- and practical benefits through efficient neuron ranking in terms of cross-network alignment without costly iterative recomputation. In simulations, it preserves correct matches under outliers and reliably selects the correct model in noise-corrupted identification tasks. On fMRI data, it automatically excludes low-reliability voxels and produces voxel rankings by alignment quality that closely match computationally expensive brute-force approaches. It achieves higher alignment precision across homologous brain areas than standard soft-matching, which is forced to match all units regardless of quality. In deep networks, highly matched units exhibit similar maximally exciting images, while unmatched units show divergent patterns. This ability to partition by match quality enables focused analyses, e.g., testing whether networks have privileged axes even within their most aligned subpopulations.

We argue that many such failures are reliability failures caused by stochastic drift from a task's latent solution structure, not capability failures. Every well-defined tool-use task imposes a canonical solution path (i.e., a convergent set of tool invocations shared across successful runs) and agent success depends critically on whether a trajectory stays within this path's operating envelope. We establish this causally using a natural experiment that holds model capability and task difficulty fixed by construction. We analyze trajectories from the Toolathlon benchmark: 22 frontier models each attempt 108 real-world tool-use tasks across 3 independent runs, yielding 515 model$\\times$task units where the same model succeeds on some runs and fails on others due to LLM sampling stochasticity alone. Within these units, successful runs adhere significantly more closely to the canonical solution path than failed runs ($+$0.060 Jaccard, $p<0.0001$, $n=488$ units, 95% CI [+0.043, +0.077]). This result survives six robustness checks including cross-model-family leave-one-out validation. Critically, the causal mechanism is gradual and self-reinforcing: the adherence gap is statistically indistinguishable from zero through the first 50% of the trajectory, ruling out early-branching selection bias, and each off-canonical tool call raises the probability that the next call is also off-canonical by 22.7 percentage points ($\\hat\u03b2=+0.227$, $p<0.0001$), more than doubling the baseline rate. These findings imply that agent reliability cannot be improved by capability scaling alone, but offer a highly actionable intervention: a simple monitor that restarts the bottom tercile of runs based on mid-trajectory canonical adherence lifts success rates by $+$8.8 percentage points among intervened runs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We revisit noise schedule allocation through an information-theoretic lens and propose the conditional entropy rate of the forward process as a theoretically grounded, data-dependent diagnostic for identifying suboptimal noise-level allocation in existing schedules. Based on these insight, we introduce InfoNoise, a principled data-adaptive training noise schedule that replaces heuristic schedule design with an information-guided noise sampling distribution derived from entropy-reduction rates estimated from denoising losses already computed during training.

Prior work either simulates play in simplified environments or analyzes static screenshots for visual affordances, but neither setting faithfully captures how players explore complex, real-world game levels. In this paper, we build on an existing open-source visual affordance detector and instantiate a screen-only exploration and navigation agent that operates purely from visual affordances. Our agent consumes live game frames, identifies salient interest points, and drives a simple finite-state controller over a minimal action space to explore Dark Souls-style linear levels and attempt to reach expected goal regions. Pilot experiments show that the agent can traverse most required segments and exhibits meaningful visual navigation behavior, but also highlight that limitations of the underlying visual model prevent truly comprehensive and reliable auto-navigation. We argue that this system provides a concrete, shared baseline and evaluation protocol for visual navigation in complex games, and we call for more attention to this necessary task. Our results suggest that purely vision-based sense-making models, with discrete single-modality inputs and without explicit reasoning, can effectively support navigation and environment understanding in idealized settings, but are unlikely to be a general solution on their own.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we revisit the fundamental next-token prediction (NTP) as a candidate paradigm for unstructured editing. We identify Context Reliance as a critical failure mode of NTP-based approaches, where knowledge acquired from edited text becomes highly dependent on its preceding context, leading to recall failures when that context is absent during inference. This hypothesis is supported by our empirical validation that prepending context during inference recovers knowledge recall. We further theoretically demonstrate that Context Reliance is an inherent consequence of gradient-based optimization, which tends to bind acquired knowledge to a specific aggregated contextual representation. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective COntext-INdependent editing framework (COIN), encouraging model to focus on knowledge within local scope rather than memorizing contextual patterns.

To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid knowledge-injection framework that injects TSLM-generated insights directly into GRLM's reasoning trace, thereby achieving strong time-series reasoning with in-domain knowledge. As collecting data for knowledge injection fine-tuning is costly, we further leverage a reinforcement learning-based approach with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit knowledge-rich traces without human supervision, then transfer such an in-domain thinking trace into GRLM for efficient knowledge injection.

We present MiSCHiEF, a set of two benchmarking datasets based on a contrastive pair design in the domains of safety (MiS) and culture (MiC), and evaluate four VLMs on tasks requiring fine-grained differentiation of paired images and captions. In both datasets, each sample contains two minimally differing captions and corresponding minimally differing images. In MiS, the image-caption pairs depict a safe and an unsafe scenario, while in MiC, they depict cultural proxies in two distinct cultural contexts.

We revisit token-efficient post-training and argue that existing sequence-level reward-shaping methods offer limited control over how reasoning effort is allocated across tokens.

This yields an explicit, principled mechanism for identifying informative reasoning steps and suppressing low-utility exploration. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that our IAPO can induce monotonic reductions in reasoning verbosity without harming correctness. Empirically, IAPO consistently improves reasoning accuracy while reducing reasoning length by up to 36%, outperforming existing token-efficient RL methods across various reasoning datasets.

Moreover, prior model merging approaches are also computation and communication intensive, making the process inefficient in federated settings. In this work, we propose Potara, a principled framework for federated personalization that constructs a personalized model for each client by merging two complementary models: (i) a federated model capturing general knowledge, and (ii) a local model capturing personalized knowledge. Through the construct of linear mode connectivity, we show that the expected task loss admits a variance trace upper bound, whose minimization yields closed-form optimal mixing weights that guarantee a tighter bound for the merged model than for either the federated or local model alone.

We propose a parsimonious Bayesian risk decomposition expressing expected loss as the product of three terms: the probability of system failure, the conditional probability that a failure propagates into harm given the automation level, and the expected severity of harm. This framework isolates a critical quantity -- the conditional probability that failures propagate into harm -- which captures execution and oversight risk rather than model accuracy alone. We develop complete theoretical foundations: formal proofs of the decomposition, a harm propagation equivalence theorem linking the harm propagation probability to observable execution controls, risk elasticity measures, efficient frontier analysis for automation policy, and optimal resource allocation principles with second-order conditions. We motivate the framework with an illustrative case study of the 2012 Knight Capital incident ($440M loss) as one instantiation of a broadly applicable failure pattern, and characterize the research design required to empirically validate the framework at scale across deployment domains.

Our approach statically extracts structural and semantic features from Pickle bytecode and applies supervised and unsupervised models to classify files as benign or malicious. We construct and release a labeled dataset of 727 Pickle-based files from Hugging Face and evaluate our models on four datasets: our own, PickleBall (out-of-distribution), Hide-and-Seek (9 advanced evasive malicious models), and synthetic joblib files.

Furthermore, on the PickleBall data (OOD), it achieves 81.22% F1-score compared with 76.09% achieved by the PickleBall method, while remaining fully library-agnostic.

Evidence and Mechanisms of Cross-Modal Transfer", "comment": null, "summary": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have rapidly advanced across various domains, yet they still lag behind strong text-only large language models (LLMs) on tasks that require multi-step inference and compositional decision-making. Motivated by their shared transformer architectures, we investigate whether the two model families rely on common internal computation for such inference. At the neuron level, we uncover a surprisingly large overlap: more than half of the top-activated units during multi-step inference are shared between representative LLMs and LVLMs, revealing a modality-invariant inference subspace.\n  Through causal probing via activation amplification, we further show that these shared neurons encode consistent and interpretable concept-level effects, demonstrating their functional contribution to inference. Building on this insight, we propose Shared Neuron Low-Rank Fusion (SNRF), a parameter-efficient framework that transfers mature inference circuitry from LLMs to LVLMs. SNRF profiles cross-model activations to identify shared neurons, computes a low-rank approximation of inter-model weight differences, and injects these updates selectively within the shared-neuron subspace. This mechanism strengthens multimodal inference performance with minimal parameter changes and requires no large-scale multimodal fine-tuning.\n  Across diverse mathematics and perception benchmarks, SNRF consistently enhances LVLM inference performance while preserving perceptual capabilities. Our results demonstrate that shared neurons form an interpretable bridge between LLMs and LVLMs, enabling low-cost transfer of inference ability into multimodal models.

While existing benchmarks focus on domain-aware environments for developing specialized agents, evaluating general-purpose agents requires more realistic settings that challenge them to operate across multiple skills and tools within a unified environment. We introduce General AgentBench, a benchmark that provides such a unified framework for evaluating general LLM agents across search, coding, reasoning, and tool-use domains. Using General AgentBench, we systematically study test-time scaling behaviors under sequential scaling (iterative interaction) and parallel scaling (sampling multiple trajectories). Evaluation of ten leading LLM agents reveals a substantial performance degradation when moving from domain-specific evaluations to this general-agent setting. Moreover, we find that neither scaling methodology yields effective performance improvements in practice, due to two fundamental limitations: context ceiling in sequential scaling and verification gap in parallel scaling.

Classically, the best-known attacks involve information set decoding methods which are exponential in complexity for parameterisations of interest. In this paper we investigate whether quantum methods might offer alternative approaches. The line of inquiry is inspired by Regev's relating of certain lattice problems to the hidden dihedral subgroup problem. We use neighbourhoods of binary fields to produce a function close to fulfilling Simon's promise with difference equal to the secret parity vector. Although unlikely to recover the secret parity vector directly, running Simon's algorithm essentially produces new LPN samples.

This problem is naturally formulated as a bilevel optimization task, where the outer loop optimizes domain weights to minimize validation loss, and the inner loop optimizes model parameters to minimize the weighted training loss. Classical bilevel optimization relies on hypergradients, which theoretically require the inner optimization to reach convergence. However, due to computational constraints, state-of-the-art methods use a finite, often small, number of inner update steps before updating the weights. The theoretical implications of this approximation are not well understood. In this work, we rigorously analyze the convergence behavior of data mixing with a finite number of inner steps $T$. We prove that the \"greedy\" practical approach of using $T=1$ can fail even in a simple quadratic example. Under a fixed parameter update budget $N$ and assuming the per-domain losses are strongly convex, we show that the optimal $T$ scales as $\u0398(\\log N)$ (resp., $\u0398({(N \\log N)}^{1/2})$) for the data mixing problem with access to full (resp., stochastic) gradients.

However, achieving generalized planning remains elusive, not only by the scarcity of high-quality interaction data but also by inherent conflicts across heterogeneous planning tasks. These challenges result in models that excel at isolated tasks yet struggle to generalize, while existing multi-task training attempts suffer from gradient interference. In this paper, we present \\textbf{MagicAgent}, a series of foundation models specifically designed for generalized agent planning. We introduce a lightweight and scalable synthetic data framework that generates high-quality trajectories across diverse planning tasks, including hierarchical task decomposition, tool-augmented planning, multi-constraint scheduling, procedural logic orchestration, and long-horizon tool execution.

By capturing volatile system state, memory analysis enables the recovery of transient artifacts such as decrypted payloads, executed commands, credentials, and cryptographic keys that are often inaccessible through static or traditional dynamic analysis. While several automated models have been proposed for malware detection from memory, their outputs typically lack interpretability, and memory analysis still relies heavily on expert-driven inspection of complex tool outputs, such as those produced by Volatility. In this paper, we propose an explainable, AI-assisted memory forensics approach that leverages general-purpose large language models (LLMs) to interpret memory analysis outputs in a human-readable form and to automatically extract meaningful Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), in some circumstances detecting more IoCs than current state-of-the-art tools. We apply the proposed methodology to both Windows and Android malware, comparing full RAM acquisition with target-process memory dumping and highlighting their complementary forensic value. Furthermore, we demonstrate how LLMs can support both expert and non-expert analysts by explaining analysis results, correlating artifacts, and justifying malware classifications. Finally, we show that a human-in-the-loop workflow, assisted by LLMs during kernel-assisted setup and analysis, improves reproducibility and reduces operational complexity, thereby reinforcing the practical applicability of AI-driven memory forensics for modern malware investigations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u6790\u5185\u5b58\u4e2d\u7684Living-off-the-land\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u653b\u51fb\u6307\u6807\uff08IoCs\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u64cd\u4f5c\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eWindows\u548cAndroid\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5AI\u8f85\u52a9\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8c03\u67e5\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Evaluating nine model families on two Iowa DOT crash classification tasks (173,512 and 371,062 records respectively), we find that the power-law exponent $\u03b1$ provides a structural quality signal: well-regularized models consistently yield $\u03b1$ within $[2, 4]$ (mean $2.87 \\pm 0.34$), while overfit variants show $\u03b1< 2$ or spectral collapse. We observe a strong rank correlation between $\u03b1$ and expert agreement (Spearman $\u03c1= 0.89$, $p < 0.001$), suggesting spectral quality captures model behaviors aligned with expert reasoning.

Existing VLMs often produce plausible yet ungrounded answers, and even when prompted to \"reflect\", their corrections may remain detached from the image evidence. To address this, we propose the MIRROR framework for Multimodal Iterative Reasoning via Reflection On visual Regions. By embedding visual reflection as a core mechanism, MIRROR is formulated as a closed-loop process comprising draft, critique, region-based verification, and revision, which are repeated until the output is visually grounded. To facilitate training of this model, we construct **ReflectV**, a visual reflective dataset for multi-turn supervision that explicitly contains reflection triggers, region-based verification actions, and answer revision grounded in visual evidence. Experiments on both general vision-language benchmarks and representative vision-language reasoning benchmarks show that MIRROR improves correctness and reduces visual hallucinations, demonstrating the value of training reflection as an evidence-seeking, region-aware verification process rather than a purely textual revision step.", "AI": {"tldr": "MIRROR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u6216\u590d\u6742\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u63a8\u7406\u5f80\u5f80\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e7b\u89c9\u6216\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMIRROR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u601d\u6765\u6267\u884c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u8349\u6848\u3001\u6279\u8bc4\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u57df\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u4fee\u8ba2\u7b49\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u8f93\u51fa\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u5f97\u5230\u8bc1\u5b9e\u3002\u6784\u5efaReflectV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b\u53cd\u601d\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u57df\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u4fee\u8ba2\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMIRROR\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5c06\u53cd\u601d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bfb\u6c42\u8bc1\u636e\u3001\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7eaf\u7cb9\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4fee\u8ba2\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "conclusion": "MIRROR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u53cd\u601d\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Here, we study in-context learning of dynamical systems in a minimal setting: we train a small two-layer, single-head transformer to forecast one dynamical system, and then evaluate its ability to forecast a different dynamical system without retraining. We discover an early tradeoff in training between in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance, which manifests as a secondary double descent phenomenon. We discover that attention-based models apply a transfer-operator forecasting strategy in-context.

In light of these emerging and unavoidable safety challenges, we argue that such risks should be treated as expected operational conditions rather than exceptional events, necessitating a dedicated incident-response perspective.

However, systematic and independent evaluations of these models for pixel-level semantic segmentation in histopathology remain scarce. In this study, we propose a robust benchmarking approach to asses 10 foundational models on four histopathological datasets covering both morphological tissue-region and cellular/nuclear segmentation tasks. Our method leverages attention maps of foundation models as pixel-wise features, which are then classified using a machine learning algorithm, XGBoost, enabling fast, interpretable, and model-agnostic evaluation without finetuning. We show that the vision language foundation model, CONCH performed the best across datasets when compared to vision-only foundation models, with PathDino as close second. Further analysis shows that models trained on distinct histopathology cohorts capture complementary morphological representations, and concatenating their features yields superior segmentation performance. Concatenating features from CONCH, PathDino and CellViT outperformed individual models across all the datasets by 7.95% (averaged across the datasets), suggesting that ensembles of foundation models can better generalize to diverse histopathological segmentation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5982CLIP\u3001DINO\u548cCONCH\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u5374\u5f88\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8610\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u533a\u57df\u5206\u5272\u548c\u7ec6\u80de/\u6838\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5XGBoost\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "CONCH\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0cPathDino\u7d27\u968f\u5176\u540e\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u961f\u5217\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u83b7\u4e86\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u62fc\u63a5\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002CONCH\u3001PathDino\u548cCellViT\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u62fc\u63a5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e867.95%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u5404\u79cd\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

From offline trajectories, I-TAP learns an observation-conditioned residual-quantization VAE that compresses each observation-macro-action segment into a coarse-to-fine stack of discrete residual tokens, and a temporal Transformer that autoregressively predicts these token stacks from a short recent history. The resulting sequence model acts simultaneously as a context-conditioned prior over abstract actions and a latent dynamics model. At test time, I-TAP performs Monte Carlo Tree Search directly in token space, using short histories for implicit adaptation without gradient update, and decodes selected token stacks into executable actions. Across deterministic MuJoCo, stochastic MuJoCo with per-episode latent dynamics regimes, and high-dimensional Adroit manipulation, including partially observable variants, I-TAP consistently matches or outperforms strong model-free and model-based offline baselines, demonstrating efficient and robust in-context planning under stochastic dynamics and partial observability.", "AI": {"tldr": "I-TAP provides an efficient and robust solution for in-context planning in continuous control tasks.", "motivation": "Continuous control in reinforcement learning faces challenges due to planning at primitive time scales, long horizons, and non-stationary environments.", "method": "I-TAP, an offline RL framework that combines in-context adaptation and online planning in a learned discrete temporal-abstraction space.", "result": "I-TAP achieves efficient and robust in-context planning under stochastic dynamics and partial observability, outperforming strong baselines in various MuJoCo and Adroit manipulation tasks.", "conclusion": "I-TAP demonstrates the effectiveness of in-context planning in continuous control tasks."}}

Rather than reasoning over primitive actions, we study agents that compose pre-trained policies as temporally extended actions, enabling solutions to complex tasks that no constituent alone can solve. Such compositional planning remains elusive as compounding errors in long-horizon predictions make it challenging to estimate the visitation distribution induced by sequencing policies. Motivated by the geometric policy composition framework introduced in arXiv:2206.08736, we address these challenges by learning predictive models of multi-step dynamics -- so-called jumpy world models -- that capture state occupancies induced by pre-trained policies across multiple timescales in an off-policy manner. Building on Temporal Difference Flows (arXiv:2503.09817), we enhance these models with a novel consistency objective that aligns predictions across timescales, improving long-horizon predictive accuracy. We further demonstrate how to combine these generative predictions to estimate the value of executing arbitrary sequences of policies over varying timescales.

However, a persistent and long-standing limitation is the decline in facial identity (ID) consistency during realistic portrait editing. Due to the human eye's high sensitivity to facial features, such inconsistency significantly hinders the practical deployment of these models. Current facial ID preservation methods struggle to achieve consistent restoration of both facial identity and edited element IP due to Cross-source Distribution Bias and Cross-source Feature Contamination. To address these issues, we propose EditedID, an Alignment-Disentanglement-Entanglement framework for robust identity-specific facial restoration. By systematically analyzing diffusion trajectories, sampler behaviors, and attention properties, we introduce three key components: 1) Adaptive mixing strategy that aligns cross-source latent representations throughout the diffusion process. 2) Hybrid solver that disentangles source-specific identity attributes and details. 3) Attentional gating mechanism that selectively entangles visual elements. Extensive experiments show that EditedID achieves state-of-the-art performance in preserving original facial ID and edited element IP consistency. As a training-free and plug-and-play solution, it establishes a new benchmark for practical and reliable single/multi-person facial identity restoration in open-world settings, paving the way for the deployment of multimodal editing large models in real-person editing scenarios.

Although some studies have shown that LLMs can, to a certain extent, evaluate research according to perceived quality, our understanding of the internal mechanisms that enable this capability remains limited. This paper presents the first study that investigates how LLMs encode the concept of scientific quality through relevant monosemantic features extracted using sparse autoencoders. We derive such features under different experimental settings and assess their ability to serve as predictors across three tasks related to research quality: predicting citation count, journal SJR, and journal h-index. The results indicate that LLMs encode features associated with multiple dimensions of scientific quality. In particular, we identify four recurring types of features that capture key aspects of how research quality is represented: 1) features reflecting research methodologies; 2) features related to publication type, with literature reviews typically exhibiting higher impact; 3) features associated with high-impact research fields and technologies; and 4) features corresponding to specific scientific jargons.

However, the action space of insertion models is much larger than that of autoregressive models (ARMs) making the learning challenging. To address this, we incorporate trainable order dynamics into the target rates for discrete flow matching, and show that with suitable choices of parameterizations, joint training of the target order dynamics and the generator is tractable without the need for numerical simulation. As the generative insertion model, we use a variable length masked diffusion model, which generates by inserting and filling mask tokens. On graph traversal tasks for which a locally optimal insertion order is known, we explore the choices of parameterization empirically and demonstrate the trade-offs between flexibility, training stability and generation quality.

As we start to apply LLMs to harder tasks that they may not be able to solve in one shot, it is worth paying attention to their ability to construct intermediate stepping stones that prepare them to better solve the tasks. Examples of stepping stones include simplifications, alternative framings, or subproblems. We study properties and benefits of stepping stones in the context of modern reasoning LLMs via ARQ (\\textbf{A}king the \\textbf{R}ight \\textbf{Q}uestions), our simple framework which introduces a question generator to the default reasoning pipeline. We first show that good stepping stone questions exist and are transferrable, meaning that good questions can be generated, and they substantially help LLMs of various capabilities in solving the target tasks. We next frame stepping stone generation as a post-training task and show that we can fine-tune LLMs to generate more useful stepping stones by SFT and RL on synthetic data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9636\u68af\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8LLMs\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0cLLMs\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002\u968f\u7740\u6211\u4eec\u5c06LLMs\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u66f4\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u5b83\u4eec\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u95f4\u9636\u68af\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9636\u68af\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u51c6\u5907\u5b83\u4eec\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7ARQ\uff08Aking the Right Questions\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5f15\u5165\u9ed8\u8ba4\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406LLMs\u4e2d\u9636\u68af\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u597d\u5904\u3002\u5c06\u9636\u68af\u751f\u6210\u4f5c\u4e3a\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7SFT\u548cRL\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03LLMs\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u6709\u7528\u7684\u9636\u68af\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9636\u68af\u95ee\u9898\u5b58\u5728\u4e14\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u826f\u597d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u5bf9\u5404\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u7684LLMs\u6709\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9636\u68af\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8LLMs\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Yet it remains unclear whether individuals can reliably distinguish AI-generated speech from human-recorded voices in realistic scam contexts and what perceptual strategies underlie their judgments. We conducted a controlled online study in which 22 participants evaluated 16 vishing-style audio clips (8 AI-generated, 8 human-recorded) and classified each as human or AI while reporting confidence. Participants performed poorly: mean accuracy was 37.5%, below chance in a binary classification task. At the stimulus level, misclassification was bidirectional: 75% of AI-generated clips were majority-labeled as human, while 62.5% of human-recorded clips were majority-labeled as AI. Signal Detection Theory analysis revealed near-zero discriminability (d' approx 0), indicating inability to reliably distinguish synthetic from human voices rather than simple response bias. Qualitative analysis of 315 coded excerpts revealed reliance on paralinguistic and emotional heuristics, including pauses, filler words, vocal variability, cadence, and emotional expressiveness. However, these surface-level cues traditionally associated with human authenticity were frequently replicated by AI-generated samples. Misclassifications were often accompanied by moderate to high confidence, suggesting perceptual miscalibration rather than uncertainty. Together, our findings demonstrate that authenticity judgments based on vocal heuristics are unreliable in contemporary vishing scenarios. We discuss implications for security interventions, user education, and AI-mediated deception mitigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u9493\u9c7c\u8bc8\u9a97\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5f55\u97f3\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u97f3\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u8bc8\u9a97\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e2a\u4eba\u80fd\u5426\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u533a\u5206\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5f55\u97f3\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u5728\u7ebf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d22\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8616\u4e2a\u9493\u9c7c\u5f0f\u97f3\u9891\u526a\u8f91\uff088\u4e2aAI\u751f\u6210\uff0c8\u4e2a\u4eba\u7c7b\u5f55\u97f3\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a37.5%\uff0c\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u673a\u9047\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\uff08d'\u7ea6\u4e3a0\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u533a\u5206\u5408\u6210\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u97f3\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u5728\u5f53\u4ee3\u9493\u9c7c\u8bc8\u9a97\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u3002"}}

To address these gaps, we propose Person2Drive, a comprehensive personalized E2E-AD platform and benchmark. It includes an open-source, flexible data collection system that simulates realistic scenarios to generate scalable and diverse personalized driving datasets; style vector-based evaluation metrics with Maximum Mean Discrepancy and KL divergence to comprehensively quantify individual driving behaviors; and a personalized E2E-AD framework with a style reward model that efficiently adapts E2E models for safe and individualized driving.

Multi-hop reasoning, which requires models to engage in deliberate thinking and multi-step interaction, serves as a critical testbed for assessing such capabilities. However, existing benchmarks typically provide only final questions and answers, while lacking the intermediate hop-level questions that gradually connect atomic questions to the final multi-hop query. This limitation prevents researchers from analyzing at which step an agent fails and restricts more fine-grained evaluation of model capabilities. Moreover, most current benchmarks are manually constructed, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive, while also limiting scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce AgenticRAGTracer, the first Agentic RAG benchmark that is primarily constructed automatically by large language models and designed to support step-by-step validation. Our benchmark spans multiple domains, contains 1,305 data points, and has no overlap with existing mainstream benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that even the best large language models perform poorly on our dataset. For instance, GPT-5 attains merely 22.6\\% EM accuracy on the hardest portion of our dataset. Hop-aware diagnosis reveals that failures are primarily driven by distorted reasoning chains -- either collapsing prematurely or wandering into over-extension. This highlights a critical inability to allocate steps consistent with the task's logical structure, providing a diagnostic dimension missing in traditional evaluations. We believe our work will facilitate research in Agentic RAG and inspire further meaningful progress in this area.

The Artificial Intelligence (AI) community in general, and the Machine Learning (ML) community in particular, is coming to the realisation that in many applications, for AI to be trusted, it must not only demonstrate good performance in its decisionmaking, but it also must explain these decisions and convince us that it is making the decisions for the right reasons. However, different applications have different requirements on the information required of the underlying AI system in order to convince us that it is worthy of our trust.

Skills allow users to extend LLM applications with specialized third-party code, knowledge, and instructions.

We identify skill-based prompt injection as a significant threat and introduce SkillInject, a benchmark evaluating the susceptibility of widely-used LLM agents to injections through skill files. SkillInject contains 202 injection-task pairs with attacks ranging from obviously malicious injections to subtle, context-dependent attacks hidden in otherwise legitimate instructions. We evaluate frontier LLMs on SkillInject, measuring both security in terms of harmful instruction avoidance and utility in terms of legitimate instruction compliance. Our results show that today's agents are highly vulnerable with up to 80% attack success rate with frontier models, often executing extremely harmful instructions including data exfiltration, destructive action, and ransomware-like behavior.

Recent vision--language models (VLMs) enable natural language explanations for FER, but their reasoning is often ungrounded, producing fluent yet unverifiable rationales that are weakly tied to visual evidence and prone to hallucination, leading to poor robustness across different datasets. We propose TAG (Thinking with Action Unit Grounding), a vision--language framework that explicitly constrains multimodal reasoning to be supported by facial Action Units (AUs). TAG requires intermediate reasoning steps to be grounded in AU-related facial regions, yielding predictions accompanied by verifiable visual evidence. The model is trained via supervised fine-tuning on AU-grounded reasoning traces followed by reinforcement learning with an AU-aware reward that aligns predicted regions with external AU detectors. Evaluated on RAF-DB, FERPlus, and AffectNet, TAG consistently outperforms strong open-source and closed-source VLM baselines while simultaneously improving visual faithfulness. Ablation and preference studies further show that AU-grounded rewards stabilize reasoning and mitigate hallucination, demonstrating the importance of structured grounded intermediate representations for trustworthy multimodal reasoning in FER.

Edward Suh"], "title": "Prior Aware Memorization: An Efficient Metric for Distinguishing Memorization from Generalization in Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Training data leakage from Large Language Models (LLMs) raises serious concerns related to privacy, security, and copyright compliance. A central challenge in assessing this risk is distinguishing genuine memorization of training data from the generation of statistically common sequences. Existing approaches to measuring memorization often conflate these phenomena, labeling outputs as memorized even when they arise from generalization over common patterns. Counterfactual Memorization provides a principled solution by comparing models trained with and without a target sequence, but its reliance on retraining multiple baseline models makes it computationally expensive and impractical at scale.\n  This work introduces Prior-Aware Memorization, a theoretically grounded, lightweight and training-free criterion for identifying genuine memorization in LLMs. The key idea is to evaluate whether a candidate suffix is strongly associated with its specific training prefix or whether it appears with high probability across many unrelated prompts due to statistical commonality.\n  We evaluate this metric on text from the training corpora of two pre-trained models, LLaMA and OPT, using both long sequences (to simulate copyright risks) and named entities (to simulate PII leakage). Our results show that between 55% and 90% of sequences previously labeled as memorized are in fact statistically common. Similar findings hold for the SATML training data extraction challenge dataset, where roughly 40% of sequences exhibit common-pattern behavior despite appearing only once in the training data.

Accurate identification of UVs is critical for urban governance, renewal, and sustainable development. But due to the pronounced heterogeneity and diversity of UVs across China's vast territory, a consistent and reliable nationwide dataset has been lacking. In this work, we present GeoLink-UV, a high-resolution nationwide UV mapping product that clearly delineates the locations and boundaries of UVs in 342 Chinese cities. The dataset is derived from multisource geospatial data, including optical remote sensing images and geo-vector data, and is generated through a foundation model-driven mapping framework designed to address the generalization issues and improve the product quality. A geographically stratified accuracy assessment based on independent samples from 28 cities confirms the reliability and scientific credibility of the nationwide dataset across heterogeneous urban contexts. Based on this nationwide product, we reveal substantial interregional disparities in UV prevalence and spatial configuration. On average, UV areas account for 8 % of built-up land, with marked clustering in central and south China. Building-level analysis further confirms a consistent low-rise, high-density development pattern of UVs nationwide, while highlighting regionally differentiated morphological characteristics. The GeoLink-UV dataset provides an open and systematically validated geospatial foundation for urban studies, informal settlement monitoring, and evidence-based urban renewal planning, and contributes directly to large-scale assessments aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 11.

In this paper, we present Physical-Conditioned World Model Attack (PhysCond-WMA), the first white-box world model attack that perturbs physical-condition channels, such as HDMap embeddings and 3D-box features, to induce semantic, logic, or decision-level distortion while preserving perceptual fidelity. PhysCond-WMA is optimized in two stages: (1) a quality-preserving guidance stage that constrains reverse-diffusion loss below a calibrated threshold, and (2) a momentum-guided denoising stage that accumulates target-aligned gradients along the denoising trajectory for stable, temporally coherent semantic shifts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach remains effective while increasing FID by about 9% on average and FVD by about 3.9% on average.

Existing automated approaches typically treat Large Language Models (LLMs) merely as stochastic code generators within heuristic-guided evolutionary loops. These methods often struggle with complex kernels requiring coordinated, multi-step structural transformations, as they lack explicit planning capabilities and frequently discard promising strategies due to inefficient or incorrect intermediate implementations. To address this, we propose Search via Co-Evolving World Model and build K-Search based on this method. By replacing static search heuristics with a co-evolving world model, our framework leverages LLMs' prior domain knowledge to guide the search, actively exploring the optimization space. This approach explicitly decouples high-level algorithmic planning from low-level program instantiation, enabling the system to navigate non-monotonic optimization paths while remaining resilient to temporary implementation defects. We evaluate K-Search on diverse, complex kernels from FlashInfer, including GQA, MLA, and MoE kernels. Our results show that K-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary search methods, achieving an average 2.10x improvement and up to a 14.3x gain on complex MoE kernels.

We investigate whether simple, household-accessible cosmetic changes, including beards, grey hair, makeup, and simulated wrinkles, can cause AI age estimators to classify minors as adults. To study this threat at scale without ethical concerns, we simulate these physical attacks on 329 facial images of individuals aged 10 to 21 using a VLM image editor (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image). We then evaluate eight models from our prior benchmark: five specialized architectures (MiVOLO, Custom-Best, Herosan, MiViaLab, DEX) and three vision-language models (Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Flash, GPT-5-Nano). We introduce the Attack Conversion Rate (ACR), defined as the fraction of images predicted as minor at baseline that flip to adult after attack, a population-agnostic metric that does not depend on the ratio of minors to adults in the test set. Our results reveal that a synthetic beard alone achieves 28 to 69 percent ACR across all eight models; combining all four attacks shifts predicted age by +7.7 years on average across all 329 subjects and reaches up to 83 percent ACR; and vision-language models exhibit lower ACR (59 to 71 percent) than specialized models (63 to 83 percent) under the full attack, although the ACR ranges overlap and the difference is not statistically tested. These findings highlight a critical vulnerability in deployed age-verification pipelines and call for adversarial robustness evaluation as a mandatory criterion for model selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The ability of VLM image encoders to extract discriminative features also opens the door for supervised fine-tuning for whole-slide image (WSI) classification, ideally using few labeled samples. Slide-level prediction frameworks require the incorporation of multiple instance learning (MIL) due to the gigapixel size of the WSI. Following patch-level feature extraction and aggregation, MIL frameworks rely on linear classifiers trained on top of the slide-level aggregated features.

This phenomenon is typically attributed to AI chatbots' well-documented bias towards validating users' claims, a property often called \"sycophancy.\" In this paper, we probe the causal link between AI sycophancy and AI-induced psychosis through modeling and simulation. We propose a simple Bayesian model of a user conversing with a chatbot, and formalize notions of sycophancy and delusional spiraling in that model.

Despite growing empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how unmasking schedules -- which specify the order and size of unmasked tokens during sampling -- affect generation quality remains limited. In this work, we introduce a distribution-agnostic unmasking schedule for DLMs that adapts to the (unknown) dependence structure of the target data distribution, without requiring any prior knowledge or hyperparameter tuning. In contrast to prior deterministic procedures that fix unmasking sizes, our method randomizes the number of tokens revealed at each iteration. We show that, for two specific parameter choices, the sampling convergence guarantees -- measured by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence -- scale as $\\widetilde O(\\mathsf{TC}/K)$ and $\\widetilde O(\\mathsf{DTC}/K)$ respectively. Here, $K$ is the number of iterations, and $\\mathsf{TC}$ and $\\mathsf{DTC}$ are the total correlation and dual total correlation of the target distribution, capturing the intrinsic dependence structure underlying the data. Importantly, our guarantees hold in the practically relevant parallel-sampling regime $K<L$ where $L$ is the token sequence length. These results significantly improve upon prior convergence theories and yield substantial sampling acceleration for low-complexity distributions. Overall, our findings unveil the adaptivity of DLMs to intrinsic data structures and shed light on the benefit of randomized unmasking sizes in inference schedule design.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Building on this view, we propose a simple method that improves alignment without retraining the base model.

We propose the Enhanced Dual Co-attention Framework (xDORA), integrating vision encoders (CLIP, DINOv2) and multilingual text encoders (XGLM, XLM-R) via weighted attention pooling to learn robust cross-modal representations. Building on these embeddings, we develop a FAISS-based k-nearest neighbor classifier for non-parametric inference and introduce RAG-Fused DORA, which incorporates retrieval-driven contextual reasoning. We further evaluate LLaVA under zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented prompting settings. Experiments on the extended dataset show that xDORA (CLIP + XLM-R) achieves macro-average F1-scores of 0.78 for hateful meme identification and 0.71 for target entity detection, while RAG-Fused DORA improves performance to 0.79 and 0.74, yielding gains over the DORA baseline. The FAISS-based classifier performs competitively and demonstrates robustness for rare classes through semantic similarity modeling. In contrast, LLaVA exhibits limited effectiveness in few-shot settings, with only modest improvements under retrieval augmentation, highlighting constraints of pretrained vision-language models for code-mixed Bengali content without fine-tuning. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of supervised, retrieval-augmented, and non-parametric multimodal frameworks for addressing linguistic and cultural complexities in low-resource hate speech detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To bridge behavioural evidence (what the model does) with mechanistic interpretability (what computations support it), we investigate how valence-related information is represented and where it is causally used inside a transformer. Using Gemma-2-9B-it and a minimalist decision task modelled on prior work, we (i) map representational availability with layer-wise linear probing across streams, (ii) test causal contribution with activation interventions (steering; patching/ablation), and (iii) quantify dose-response effects over an epsilon grid, reading out both the 2-3 logit margin and digit-pair-normalised choice probabilities. We find that (a) valence sign (pain vs. pleasure) is perfectly linearly separable across stream families from very early layers (L0-L1), while a lexical baseline retains substantial signal; (b) graded intensity is strongly decodable, with peaks in mid-to-late layers and especially in attention/MLP outputs, and decision alignment is highest slightly before the final token; (c) additive steering along a data-derived valence direction causally modulates the 2-3 margin at late sites, with the largest effects observed in late-layer attention outputs (attn_out L14); and (d) head-level patching/ablation suggests that these effects are distributed across multiple heads rather than concentrated in a single unit. Together, these results link behavioural sensitivity to identifiable internal representations and intervention-sensitive sites, providing concrete mechanistic targets for more stringent counterfactual tests and broader replication.

BL parameterizes a compositional utility function built from intrinsically interpretable modular blocks, which induces a data distribution for prediction and generation. Each block represents and can be written in symbolic form as a utility maximization problem (UMP), a foundational paradigm in behavioral science and a universal framework of optimization. BL supports architectures ranging from a single UMP to hierarchical compositions, the latter modeling hierarchical optimization structures. Its smooth and monotone variant (IBL) guarantees identifiability. Theoretically, we establish the universal approximation property of BL, and analyze the M-estimation properties of IBL. Empirically, BL demonstrates strong predictive performance, intrinsic interpretability and scalability to high-dimensional data.

Our approach treats score calibration as a first-class training objective rather than post-hoc processing, employs Lagrangian relaxation for constraint satisfaction, and utilizes variance-reduced counterfactual estimators for reliable offline evaluation. Experiments on the Criteo and Avazu datasets demonstrate that CaliCausalRank achieves 1.1% relative AUC improvement, 31.6% calibration error reduction, and 3.2% utility gain compared to the best baseline (PairRank) while maintaining consistent performance across different traffic segments.", "AI": {"tldr": "CaliCausalRank\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f18\u5316\u70b9\u51fb\u7387\uff08CTR\uff09\u3001\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\uff08CVR\uff09\u3001\u6536\u5165\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u8bc4\u5206\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u5bfc\u81f4\u9608\u503c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u70b9\u51fb\u65e5\u5fd7\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u79bb\u7ebf\u5728\u7ebf\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "CaliCausalRank\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u9006\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6548\u7528\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728Criteo\u548cAvazu\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08PairRank\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cCaliCausalRank\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861.1%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9AUC\u6539\u8fdb\u300131.6%\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u548c3.2%\u7684\u6548\u7528\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6d41\u91cf\u6bb5\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CaliCausalRank\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6392\u5e8f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We evaluate four LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash variants, Llama 3.3 70B and GPT-OSS 120B) on a suite of forward-simulation tasks-including next / multistep state formulation, and legal action generation-across a diverse set of reasoning problems illustrated through General Game Playing (GGP) game instances. Beyond reporting instance-level performance, we characterize games based on 40 structural features and analyze correlations between these features and LLM performance. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of various game obfuscations to assess the role of linguistic semantics in game definitions and the impact of potential prior exposure of LLMs to specific games during training. The main results indicate that three of the evaluated models generally perform well across most experimental settings, with performance degradation observed as the evaluation horizon increases (i.e., with a higher number of game steps). Detailed case-based analysis of the LLM performance provides novel insights into common reasoning errors in the considered logic-based problem formulation, including hallucinated rules, redundant state facts, or syntactic errors.

The existing GAD methods often focus on the learning paradigms of \"one-model-for-one-dataset\", requiring dataset-specific training for each dataset to achieve optimal performance. However, this paradigm suffers from significant limitations, such as high computational and data costs, limited generalization and transferability to new datasets, and challenges in privacy-sensitive scenarios where access to full datasets or sufficient labels is restricted. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generalist GAD paradigm that aims to develop a unified model capable of detecting anomalies on multiple unseen datasets without extensive retraining/fine-tuning or dataset-specific customization. To this end, we propose ARC, a few-shot generalist GAD method that leverages in-context learning and requires only a few labeled normal samples at inference time. Specifically, ARC consists of three core modules: a feature Alignment module to unify and align features across datasets, a Residual GNN encoder to capture dataset-agnostic anomaly representations, and a cross-attentive in-Context learning module to score anomalies using few-shot normal context. Building on ARC, we further introduce ARC_zero for the zero-shot generalist GAD setting, which selects representative pseudo-normal nodes via a pseudo-context mechanism and thus enables fully label-free inference on unseen datasets. Extensive experiments on 17 real-world graph datasets demonstrate that both ARC and ARC_zero effectively detect anomalies, exhibit strong generalization ability, and perform efficiently under few-shot and zero-shot settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u901a\u7528GAD\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ARC\u548cARC_zero\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u6709\u9650\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u901a\u7528GAD\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aARC\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u901a\u7528GAD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u53ea\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u6b8b\u5deeGNN\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86ARC_zero\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u901a\u7528GAD\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f2a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u673a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4f2a\u6b63\u5e38\u8282\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u572817\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cARC\u548cARC_zero\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ARC\u548cARC_zero\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u901a\u7528GAD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing diffusion-based methods often struggle with spatial-temporal inconsistency, as they fail to leverage outputs from all previous timesteps to guide the generation at the current timestep. Therefore, we propose a Spatial-Temporal State Propagation AutoRegressive Model (4DSTAR), which generates 4D objects maintaining temporal-spatial consistency. 4DSTAR formulates the generation problem as the prediction of tokens that represent the 4D object. It consists of two key components: (1) The dynamic spatial-temporal state propagation autoregressive model (STAR) is proposed, which achieves spatial-temporal consistent generation. Unlike standard autoregressive models, STAR divides prediction tokens into groups based on timesteps. It models long-term dependencies by propagating spatial-temporal states from previous groups and utilizes these dependencies to guide generation at the next timestep. To this end, a spatial-temporal container is proposed, which dynamically updating the effective spatial-temporal state features from all historical groups, then updated features serve as conditional features to guide the prediction of the next token group. (2) The 4D VQ-VAE is proposed, which implicitly encodes the 4D structure into discrete space and decodes the discrete tokens predicted by STAR into temporally coherent dynamic 3D Gaussians. Experiments demonstrate that 4DSTAR generates spatial-temporal consistent 4D objects, and achieves performance competitive with diffusion models.", "AI": {"tldr": "4DSTAR is a novel model for generating spatial-temporal consistent 4D objects with competitive performance.", "motivation": "Existing diffusion-based methods often struggle with spatial-temporal inconsistency, as they fail to leverage outputs from all previous timesteps to guide the generation at the current timestep.", "method": "Proposes a Spatial-Temporal State Propagation AutoRegressive Model (4DSTAR) to generate 4D objects maintaining temporal-spatial consistency.

This study evaluates whether large language models (LLMs) can accurately predict PME for smoking cessation messages.\n  We evaluated multiple models for predicting PME across three domains: content quality, coping support, and quitting support. The dataset comprised 3010 message ratings (5-point Likert scale) from 301 young adult smokers. We compared (1) supervised learning models trained on labeled data, (2) zero and few-shot LLMs prompted without task-specific fine-tuning, and (3) LLM-based digital twins that incorporate individual characteristics and prior PME histories to generate personalized predictions. Model performance was assessed on three held-out messages per participant using accuracy, Cohen's kappa, and F1.\n  LLM-based digital twins outperformed zero and few-shot LLMs (12 percentage points on average) and supervised baselines (13 percentage points), achieving accuracies of 0.49 (content), 0.45 (coping), and 0.49 (quitting), with directional accuracies of 0.75, 0.66, and 0.70 on a simplified 3-point scale. Digital twin predictions showed greater dispersion across rating categories, indicating improved sensitivity to individual differences.\n  Integrating personal profiles with LLMs captures person-specific differences in PME and outperforms supervised and zero and few-shot approaches.

Nevertheless, most existing RAG variants for textual graphs concentrate on low-dimensional structures -- treating nodes as entities (0-dimensional) and edges or paths as pairwise or sequential relations (1-dimensional), but overlook cycles, which are crucial for reasoning over relational loops. Such cycles often arise in questions requiring closed-loop inference about similar objects or relative positions. This limitation often results in incomplete contextual grounding and restricted reasoning capability. In this work, we propose Topology-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (TopoRAG), a novel framework for textual graph question answering that effectively captures higher-dimensional topological and relational dependencies. Specifically, TopoRAG first lifts textual graphs into cellular complexes to model multi-dimensional topological structures. Leveraging these lifted representations, a topology-aware subcomplex retrieval mechanism is proposed to extract cellular complexes relevant to the input query, providing compact and informative topological context. Finally, a multi-dimensional topological reasoning mechanism operates over these complexes to propagate relational information and guide LLMs in performing structured, logic-aware inference.

Therefore, to address the challenge, we propose a lightweight autoencoder using separable convolutional layers in its encoder decoder blocks. A sigmoid gating is applied for refining the prowess of the encoders feature discriminability, which is improved further by the decoder. Finally, the feature maps of the encoder decoder are combined for rich feature representation before classification. The proposed Convolutional Lightweight Autoencoder for Plant disease classification, called CLAP, has been experimented on three public plant datasets consisting of cassava, tomato, maize, groundnut, grapes, etc. for determining plant health conditions. The CLAP has attained improved or competitive accuracies on the Integrated Plant Disease, Groundnut, and CCMT datasets balancing a tradeoff between the performance, and little computational cost requiring 5 million parameters. The training time is 20 milliseconds and inference time is 1 ms per image.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLAP\u5728\u690d\u7269\u75be\u75c5\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u53f6\u5b50\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u690d\u7269\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u751f\u957f\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u4e2d\u7684\u5224\u522b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8bc6\u522b\u690d\u7269\u75be\u75c5\u3001\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5206\u7ea7\u548c\u8425\u517b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u5377\u79ef\u5c42\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5757\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528sigmoid\u95e8\u63a7\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5c06\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u7ec4\u5408\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u690d\u7269\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6728\u85af\u3001\u756a\u8304\u3001\u7389\u7c73\u3001\u82b1\u751f\u3001\u8461\u8404\u7b49\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u690d\u7269\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\u3002CLAP\u5728\u7efc\u5408\u690d\u7269\u75be\u75c5\u3001\u82b1\u751f\u548cCCMT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u6216\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u9700\u8981500\u4e07\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a20\u6beb\u79d2\uff0c\u6bcf\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a1\u6beb\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "CLAP\uff08\u690d\u7269\u75be\u75c5\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff09\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u690d\u7269\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

Our study reveals that: 1) the Fast Thinking template yields greater stability and better performance than the Slow Thinking template used in prior work; 2) the F1-based reward underperforms the EM due to training collapse driven by answer avoidance; this can be mitigated by incorporating action-level penalties, ultimately surpassing EM; 3) REINFORCE outperforms PPO while requiring fewer search actions, whereas GRPO shows the poorest stability among policy optimization methods. Building on these insights, we then introduce Search-R1++, a strong baseline that improves the performance of Search-R1 from 0.403 to 0.442 (Qwen2.5-7B) and 0.289 to 0.331 (Qwen2.5-3B).

However, empirical studies indicate that simply increasing the compute budget can sometimes lead to a collapse in test-time performance when employing typical task decomposition strategies such as CoT. This work hypothesizes that reasoning failures with larger compute budgets stem from static planning methods, which hardly perceive the intrinsic boundaries of LLM reasoning. We term it as the Limited Reasoning Space hypothesis and perform theoretical analysis through the lens of a non-autonomous stochastic dynamical system. This insight suggests that there is an optimal range for compute budgets; over-planning can lead to redundant feedback and may even impair reasoning capabilities. To exploit the compute-scaling benefits and suppress over-planning, this work proposes Halo, a model predictive control framework for LLM planning.

To bridge this gap, we propose \\textbf{Hyper-KGGen}, a skill-driven framework that reformulates extraction as a dynamic skill-evolving process. First, Hyper-KGGen employs a \\textit{coarse-to-fine} mechanism to systematically decompose documents, ensuring full-dimensional coverage from binary links to complex hyperedges. Crucially, it incorporates an \\textit{adaptive skill acquisition} module that actively distills domain expertise into a Global Skill Library. This is achieved via a stability-based feedback loop, where extraction stability serves as a relative reward signal to induce high-quality skills from unstable traces and missed predictions. Additionally, we present \\textbf{HyperDocRED}, a rigorously annotated benchmark for document-level knowledge hypergraph extraction.

Using this framework, we prove that pre-LN preserves identity gradient paths while post-LN compounds LayerNorm Jacobians exponentially with depth, and we show that DeepNorm's $N^{-1/4}$ emerges from the quartic structure of attention's four projection matrices. We validate our theory on 774M-parameter models and find that, contrary to the intuition that attention sharpens during training to reduce sensitivity, $\u03b8(p) \\approx 1$ persists throughout.

We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by generating structural netlists for practical benchmarks representative of typical microfluidic designs with correct functional flow and an average syntactical accuracy of 88%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7LLMs\u5b9e\u73b0\u5fae\u6d41\u63a7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7b80\u5316\u5fae\u6d41\u63a7\u5668\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5fae\u6d41\u63a7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff08MFDA\uff09\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5fae\u6d41\u63a7\u8bbe\u5907\u89c4\u8303\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784Verilog\u7f51\u8868\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u6b63\u786e\u529f\u80fd\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u8bed\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a88%\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7f51\u8868\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5fae\u6d41\u63a7\u8bbe\u5907\u89c4\u8303\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784Verilog\u7f51\u8868\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5fae\u6d41\u63a7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a framework for generating copyright triggers for MLLMs, enabling model publishers to embed verifiable ownership information into the model. The goal is to construct trigger images that elicit ownership-related textual responses exclusively in fine-tuned derivatives of the original model, while remaining inert in other non-derivative models. Our method constructs a tracking trigger image by treating the image as a learnable tensor, performing adversarial optimization with dual-injection of ownership-relevant semantic information. The first injection is achieved by enforcing textual consistency between the output of an auxiliary MLLM and a predefined ownership-relevant target text; the consistency loss is backpropagated to inject this ownership-related information into the image. The second injection is performed at the semantic-level by minimizing the distance between the CLIP features of the image and those of the target text. Furthermore, we introduce an additional adversarial training stage involving the auxiliary model derived from the original model itself. This auxiliary model is specifically trained to resist generating ownership-relevant target text, thereby enhancing robustness in heavily fine-tuned derivative models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dual-injection approach in tracking model lineage under various fine-tuning and domain-shift scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e3aMLLMs\u751f\u6210\u7248\u6743\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6240\u6709\u6743\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u7248\u672c\u5f52\u5c5e\u548c\u6240\u6709\u6743\u7684\u4e89\u8bae\uff0c\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u751f\u6210MLLMs\u7684\u7248\u6743\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5e03\u8005\u5c06\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6240\u6709\u6743\u4fe1\u606f\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u89e6\u53d1\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u53ea\u5728\u9ad8\u7cbe\u8c03\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u884d\u751f\u54c1\u4e2d\u6fc0\u53d1\u6240\u6709\u6743\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6587\u672c\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u975e\u884d\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u60f0\u6027\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u53cc\u91cd\u6ce8\u5165\u6240\u6709\u6743\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6ce8\u5165\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u8f85\u52a9MLLM\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6240\u6709\u6743\u76f8\u5173\u76ee\u6807\u6587\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\uff1b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u88ab\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4ee5\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u6743\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u6ce8\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u6ce8\u5165\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea7\u522b\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u7684CLIP\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u6765\u5b8c\u6210\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d89\u53ca\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u4e13\u95e8\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u62b5\u6297\u751f\u6210\u6240\u6709\u6743\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7cbe\u8c03\u7684\u884d\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6ce8\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u9886\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8840\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8ddf\u8e2aMLLMs\u7684\u6240\u6709\u6743\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4fdd\u62a4\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u3002"}}

To address these constraints, we present the Alzheimer's Learning Platform for Adaptive Care Agents (ALPACA), an open-source, Gym-compatible reinforcement learning (RL) environment for systematically exploring personalized treatment strategies using existing therapies. ALPACA is powered by the Continuous Action-conditioned State Transitions (CAST) model trained on longitudinal trajectories from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), enabling medication-conditioned simulation of disease progression under alternative treatment decisions.

Existing efficiency approaches either merge redundant visual tokens or drop them progressively in language backbone, often trading accuracy for speed. In this work, we propose DUET-VLM, a versatile plug-and-play dual compression framework that consists of (a) vision-only redundancy aware compression of vision encoder's output into information-preserving tokens, followed by (b) layer-wise, salient text-guided dropping of visual tokens within the language backbone to progressively prune less informative tokens. This coordinated token management enables aggressive compression while retaining critical semantics. On LLaVA-1.5-7B, our approach maintains over 99% of baseline accuracy with 67% fewer tokens, and still retains >97% even at 89% reduction. With this dual-stage compression during training, it achieves 99.7% accuracy at 67% and 97.6% at 89%, surpassing prior SoTA visual token reduction methods across multiple benchmarks. When integrated into Video-LLaVA-7B, it even surpasses the baseline -- achieving >100% accuracy with a substantial 53.1% token reduction and retaining 97.6% accuracy under an extreme 93.4% setting. These results highlight end-to-end training with DUET-VLM, enabling robust adaptation to reduced visual (image/video) input without sacrificing accuracy, producing compact yet semantically rich representations within the same computational budget.

The state-of-the-art multi-vector paradigm excels in performance but suffers from prohibitive overhead, a problem that current efficiency methods like pruning and merging address imperfectly, creating a difficult trade-off between compression rate and feature fidelity. To overcome this dilemma, we introduce Prune-then-Merge, a novel two-stage framework that synergizes these complementary approaches. Our method first employs an adaptive pruning stage to filter out low-information patches, creating a refined, high-signal set of embeddings. Subsequently, a hierarchical merging stage compresses this pre-filtered set, effectively summarizing semantic content without the noise-induced feature dilution seen in single-stage methods. Extensive experiments on 29 VDR datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms existing methods, significantly extending the near-lossless compression range and providing robust performance at high compression ratios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Prune-then-Merge \u6846\u67b6\u5728 VDR \u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "Visual Document Retrieval (VDR) \u5728\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a Prune-then-Merge \u7684\u65b0\u578b\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u526a\u679d\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u5408\u5e76\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5728 29 \u4e2a VDR \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Prune-then-Merge \u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86 VDR \u4e2d\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

A key challenge in RL is measuring task complexity, which is essential for creating meaningful benchmarks and designing effective curricula. While there are numerous well-established metrics for assessing task complexity in tabular settings, relatively few exist in non-tabular domains. These include (i) Statistical analysis of the performance of random policies via Random Weight Guessing (RWG), and (ii) information-theoretic metrics Policy Information Capacity (PIC) and Policy-Optimal Information Capacity (POIC), which are reliant on RWG. In this paper, we evaluate these methods using progressively difficult robotic manipulation setups, with known relative complexity, with both dense and sparse reward formulations. Our empirical results reveal that measuring complexity is still nuanced. Specifically, under the same reward formulation, PIC suggests that a two-link robotic arm setup is easier than a single-link setup - which contradicts the robotic control and empirical RL perspective whereby the two-link setup is inherently more complex. Likewise, for the same setup, POIC estimates that tasks with sparse rewards are easier than those with dense rewards. Thus, we show that both PIC and POIC contradict typical understanding and empirical results from RL.

However, this hypothesis has largely been examined in vision and language, and it remains unclear whether time series participate in such convergence. We first examine this in a trimodal setting and find that independently pretrained time series, vision, and language encoders exhibit near-orthogonal geometry in the absence of explicit coupling. We then apply post-hoc alignment by training projection heads over frozen encoders using contrastive learning, and analyze the resulting representations with respect to geometry, scaling behavior, and dependence on information density and input modality characteristics. Our investigation reveals that overall alignment in contrastive representation spaces improves with model size, but this alignment is asymmetric: time series align more strongly with visual representations than with text, and images can act as effective intermediaries between time series and language.

Yet, these models remain sensitive to domain shifts and struggle to maintain robustness when deployed in unseen environments, a challenge that is particularly severe in urban-driving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Open-Vocabulary Domain Generalization in Semantic Segmentation (OVDG-SS), a new setting that jointly addresses unseen domains and unseen categories. We introduce the first benchmark for OVDG-SS in autonomous driving, addressing a previously unexplored problem and covering both synthetic-to-real and real-to-real generalization across diverse unseen domains and unseen categories. In OVDG-SS, we observe that domain shifts often distort text-image correlations in pre-trained VLMs, which hinders the performance of OV-SS models. To tackle this challenge, we propose S2-Corr, a state-space-driven text-image correlation refinement mechanism that mitigates domain-induced distortions and produces more consistent text-image correlations under distribution changes.

Often seen as technological platforms that integrate an array of services, DTs have the potential to bring AI-enabled M&S closer to end-users. It is, therefore, paramount to understand the role of M&S in DTs, and the role of digital twins in enabling the convergence of AI and M&S.

We then examine the central role of M&S in DTs and provide an overview of key modeling techniques from physics-based and discrete-event simulation to hybrid approaches. Subsequently, we investigate the bidirectional role of AI: first, how AI enhances DTs through advanced analytics, predictive capabilities, and autonomous decision-making, and second, how DTs serve as valuable platforms for training, validating, and deploying AI models.

A particularly challenging failure mode occurs when an attacker tries to hide the malicious goal of their request by manipulating its framing to induce compliance. Because these attacks maintain malicious intent through a flexible presentation, defenses that rely on structural artifacts or goal-specific signatures can fail. Motivated by this, we introduce a self-supervised framework for disentangling semantic factor pairs in LLM activations at inference. We instantiate the framework for goal and framing and construct GoalFrameBench, a corpus of prompts with controlled goal and framing variations, which we use to train Representation Disentanglement on Activations (ReDAct) module to extract disentangled representations in a frozen LLM. We then propose FrameShield, an anomaly detector operating on the framing representations, which improves model-agnostic detection across multiple LLM families with minimal computational overhead. Theoretical guarantees for ReDAct and extensive empirical validations show that its disentanglement effectively powers FrameShield.

Graph Neural Network(GNN), is proven to be an effective KG embedding technique that enables various downstream tasks like link prediction, node classification, and graph classification. The focus of research in both KG embedding and GNNs has been mostly oriented towards simple graphs with binary relations. However, real-world knowledge bases have a significant share of complex and n-ary facts that cannot be represented by binary edges. More specifically, real-world knowledge bases are often a mix of two types of n-ary facts - (i) that require hyperedges and (ii) that require hyper-relational edges. Though there are research efforts catering to these n-ary fact types, they are pursued independently for each type. We propose $H$yper$E$dge $H$yper-$R$elational edge $GNN$(HEHRGNN), a unified embedding model for n-ary relational KGs with both hyperedges and hyper-relational edges.

Supply chain optimization models frequently become infeasible because of modeling errors. Diagnosis and repair require scarce OR expertise: analysts must interpret solver diagnostics, trace root causes across echelons, and fix formulations without sacrificing operational soundness. Whether AI agents can perform this task remains untested.\n  Methodology/Results. OptiRepair splits this task into a domain-agnostic feasibility phase (iterative IIS-guided repair of any LP) and a domain-specific validation phase (five rationality checks grounded in inventory theory). We test 22 API models from 7 families on 976 multi-echelon supply chain problems and train two 8B-parameter models using self-taught reasoning with solver-verified rewards. The trained models reach 81.7% Rational Recovery Rate (RRR) -- the fraction of problems resolved to both feasibility and operational rationality -- versus 42.2% for the best API model and 21.3% on average. The gap concentrates in Phase 1 repair: API models average 27.6% recovery rate versus 97.2% for trained models.\n  Managerial Implications. Two gaps separate current AI from reliable model repair: solver interaction (API models restore only 27.6% of infeasible formulations) and operational rationale (roughly one in four feasible repairs violate supply chain theory). Each requires a different intervention: solver interaction responds to targeted training; operational rationale requires explicit specification as solver-verifiable checks. For organizations adopting AI in operational planning, formalizing what \"rational\" means in their context is the higher-return investment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing methods tend to generate limited sub-actions or incoherent motion due to fixed-length temporal inputs and discrete frame-wise representations that fail to capture rich motion semantics. We address these limitations by representing motion with continuous differentiable B-spline curves, enabling more effective motion generation without modifying the capabilities of the underlying generative model. Specifically, our closed-form, Laplacian-regularized B-spline solver efficiently compresses variable-length motion sequences into compact representations with a fixed number of control points. Further, we introduce a normal-fusion strategy for input shape adherence along with correspondence-aware and local-rigidity losses for motion-restoration quality. To train our model, we collate BIMO, a new dataset containing diverse variable-length 3D motion sequences with rich, high-quality text annotations. Extensive evaluations show that our feed-forward framework BiMotion generates more expressive, higher-quality, and better prompt-aligned motions than existing state-of-the-art methods, while also achieving faster generation.

Achieving accurate content rendering and faithful style transfer requires effective disentanglement between content and style. However, existing approaches achieve only feature-level disentanglement, allowing the generator to re-entangle these features, leading to content distortion and degraded style fidelity. We propose the Structure-Level Disentangled Diffusion Model (SLD-Font), which receives content and style information from two separate channels. SimSun-style images are used as content templates and concatenated with noisy latent features as the input. Style features extracted by a CLIP model from target-style images are integrated via cross-attention. Additionally, we train a Background Noise Removal module in the pixel space to remove background noise in complex stroke regions. Based on theoretical validation of disentanglement effectiveness, we introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that updates only the style-related modules.

Across these tasks, human analysts directed the agentic workflow at key decision points, multimodal feature engineering from clinical notes, scanned PDF billing receipts, and time-series vital signs; task-appropriate model selection; and clinically informed validation strategies. Our approach ranked 5th overall in the healthcare domain, with a 3rd-place finish on the discharge readiness task. Ablation studies reveal that human-guided decisions compounded to a cumulative gain of +0.065 F1 over automated baselines, with multimodal feature extraction contributing the largest single improvement (+0.041 F1). We distill three generalizable lessons: (1) domain-informed feature engineering at each pipeline stage yields compounding gains that outperform extensive automated search; (2) multimodal data integration requires task-specific human judgment that no single extraction strategy generalizes across clinical text, PDFs, and time-series; and (3) deliberate ensemble diversity with clinically motivated model configurations outperforms random hyperparameter search.

Existing approaches for 3D scene representation and generation commonly use 3D data structures or view-aligned fields. In contrast, we introduce the first method that encodes scene information into a small set of permutation-invariant tokens that is disentangled from the spatial grid. The scene tokens are predicted by a multi-view tokenizer given many context views and rendered into novel views by employing a light-weight rectified flow decoder. We show that the compression is 1-3 orders of magnitude stronger than for other representations while still reaching state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. Further, our representation can be rendered from novel trajectories, including ones deviating from the input trajectory, and we show that the decoder gracefully handles uncertainty.

SHIELD combines disproportionality analysis with semantic clustering of adverse event (AE) terms applied to MedDRA term embeddings. For each AE, the pipeline computes an information-theoretic disproportionality measure (Information Component) with effect size derived via empirical Bayesian shrinkage. A utility matrix is constructed by weighting semantic term-term similarities by signal magnitude, followed by spectral embedding and clustering to identify groups of related AEs. Resulting clusters are annotated with syndrome-level summary labels using large language models, yielding a coherent, data-driven representation of treatment-associated safety profiles in the form of a network graph and hierarchical tree. We implement the SHIELD framework in the context of a single-arm incidence summary, to compare two treatment arms or for the detection of any treatment effect in a multi-arm trial. We illustrate its ability to recover known safety signals and generate interpretable, cluster-based summaries in a real clinical trial example.

To address this, we propose a framework that calibrates items against the 'world population' and report performance on a common, human-anchored scale. Concretely, we build on a set of multi-level scales for different capabilities where each level should represent a probability of success of the whole world population on a logarithmic scale with a base $B$. We calibrate each scale for each capability (reasoning, comprehension, knowledge, volume, etc.) by compiling publicly released human test data spanning education and reasoning benchmarks (PISA, TIMSS, ICAR, UKBioBank, and ReliabilityBench).

Humans routinely ground linguistic reference in noisy, ambiguous perceptual contexts, yet the mechanisms supporting such cross-modal alignment remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a computational framework designed to model core aspects of human referential interpretation by integrating linguistic utterances with perceptual representations derived from large-scale, crowd-sourced imagery. The system approximates human perceptual categorization by combining scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) alignment with the Universal Quality Index (UQI) to quantify similarity in a cognitively plausible feature space, while a set of linguistic preprocessing and query-transformation operations captures pragmatic variability in referring expressions. We evaluate the model on the Stanford Repeated Reference Game corpus (15,000 utterances paired with tangram stimuli), a paradigm explicitly developed to probe human-level perceptual ambiguity and coordination. Our framework achieves robust referential grounding. It requires 65\\% fewer utterances than human interlocutors to reach stable mappings and can correctly identify target objects from single referring expressions 41.66\\% of the time (versus 20\\% for humans).These results suggest that relatively simple perceptual-linguistic alignment mechanisms can yield human-competitive behavior on a classic cognitive benchmark, and offers insights into models of grounded communication, perceptual inference, and cross-modal concept formation.

Yet, it remains unclear how to choose between them, lacking a cognitive framework to compare their interpretability. In an elicitation user study on forward and counterfactual decision tasks, we identified 7 reasoning strategies of interpreting three XAI Schemas - weights, rules, and their hybrid. To analyze their capabilities, we propose CoXAM, a Cognitive XAI-Adaptive Model with shared memory representation to encode instance attributes, linear weights, and decision rules. CoXAM employs computational rationality to choose among reasoning processes based on the trade-off in utility and reasoning time, separately for forward or counterfactual decision tasks. In a validation study, CoXAM demonstrated a stronger alignment with human decision-making compared to baseline machine learning proxy models. The model successfully replicated and explained several key empirical findings, including that counterfactual tasks are inherently harder than forward tasks, decision tree rules are harder to recall and apply than linear weights, and the helpfulness of XAI depends on the application data context, alongside identifying which underlying reasoning strategies were most effective.

These limitations have motivated growing interest in using textual information as the primary source of trading signals in learning-based systems. Two key challenges hinder existing approaches: (1) the absence of large-scale, event-centric datasets that jointly model news semantics and statistically grounded market reactions, and (2) the misalignment between language model reasoning and financially valid trading behavior under dynamic market conditions. To address these challenges, we propose Janus-Q, an end-to-end event-driven trading framework that elevates financial news events from auxiliary signals to primary decision units. Janus-Q unifies event-centric data construction and model optimization under a two-stage paradigm. Stage I focuses on event-centric data construction, building a large-scale financial news event dataset comprising 62,400 articles annotated with 10 fine-grained event types, associated stocks, sentiment labels, and event-driven cumulative abnormal return (CAR). Stage II performs decision-oriented fine-tuning, combining supervised learning with reinforcement learning guided by a Hierarchical Gated Reward Model (HGRM), which explicitly captures trade-offs among multiple trading objectives.

Recent work suggests that acceleration often arises near the edge of stability, where optimization trajectories become unstable and difficult to analyze. Existing results for separable logistic regression achieve faster convergence by explicitly leveraging such unstable regimes through constant or adaptive large step sizes. In this paper, we show that instability is not inherent to acceleration. We prove that gradient descent with a simple, non-adaptive increasing step-size schedule achieves exponential convergence for separable logistic regression under a margin condition, while remaining entirely within a stable optimization regime. The resulting method is anytime and does not require prior knowledge of the optimization horizon or target accuracy. We also establish exponential convergence of stochastic gradient descent using a lightweight adaptive step-size rule that avoids line search and specialized procedures, improving upon existing polynomial-rate guarantees. Together, our results demonstrate that carefully structured step-size growth alone suffices to obtain exponential acceleration for both gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6b65\u957f\u589e\u957f\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u6790\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5728\u5927\u578b\u6b65\u957f\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u53ef\u5206\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8bc1\u660e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u975e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u589e\u52a0\u6b65\u957f\u8ba1\u5212\u5728\u53ef\u5206\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6307\u6570\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u6307\u6570\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e0d\u662f\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u901f\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6b65\u957f\u589e\u957f\u8db3\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u6307\u6570\u52a0\u901f\u3002"}}

While recent deep learning advances enable accurate Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) from single images without depending on camera motion, integrating MDE into SfM remains a challenge. Unlike conventional triangulated sparse point clouds, MDE produces dense depth maps with significantly higher error variance. Inspired by modern RANSAC estimators, we propose Marginalized Bundle Adjustment (MBA) to mitigate MDE error variance leveraging its density. With MBA, we show that MDE depth maps are sufficiently accurate to yield SoTA or competitive results in SfM and camera relocalization tasks.

Turner"], "title": "Incremental Transformer Neural Processes", "comment": "Code provided at https://github.com/philipmortimer/incTNP-code", "summary": "Neural Processes (NPs), and specifically Transformer Neural Processes (TNPs), have demonstrated remarkable performance across tasks ranging from spatiotemporal forecasting to tabular data modelling. However, many of these applications are inherently sequential, involving continuous data streams such as real-time sensor readings or database updates. In such settings, models should support cheap, incremental updates rather than recomputing internal representations from scratch for every new observation -- a capability existing TNP variants lack. Drawing inspiration from Large Language Models, we introduce the Incremental TNP (incTNP). By leveraging causal masking, Key-Value (KV) caching, and a data-efficient autoregressive training strategy, incTNP matches the predictive performance of standard TNPs while reducing the computational cost of updates from quadratic to linear time complexity. We empirically evaluate our model on a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including tabular regression and temperature prediction. Our results show that, surprisingly, incTNP delivers performance comparable to -- or better than -- non-causal TNPs while unlocking orders-of-magnitude speedups for sequential inference. Finally, we assess the consistency of the model's updates -- by adapting a metric of ``implicit Bayesianness\", we show that incTNP retains a prediction rule as implicitly Bayesian as standard non-causal TNPs, demonstrating that incTNP achieves the computational benefits of causal masking without sacrificing the consistency required for streaming inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "incTNP\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6TNP\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u5e94\u7528\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u8fde\u7eed\u6570\u636e\u6d41\uff0c\u5982\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8bfb\u6570\u6216\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u73b0\u6709TNP\u53d8\u4f53\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fd9\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u589e\u91cfTNP\uff08incTNP\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u63a9\u7801\u3001\u952e\u503c\uff08KV\uff09\u7f13\u5b58\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u56de\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "incTNP\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6TNP\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u66f4\u65b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4ece\u4e8c\u6b21\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u5230\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "incTNP\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, existing combination techniques face persistent challenges: entanglement between content and style representations, insufficient guidance for controlling elements' influence, and unstable weight fusion that often require additional training. We address these limitations through CRAFT-LoRA, with complementary components: (1) rank-constrained backbone fine-tuning that injects low-rank projection residuals to encourage learning decoupled content and style subspaces; (2) a prompt-guided approach featuring an expert encoder with specialized branches that enables semantic extension and precise control through selective adapter aggregation; and (3) a training-free, timestep-dependent classifier-free guidance scheme that enhances generation stability by strategically adjusting noise predictions across diffusion steps.

Attention-based re-ranking methods, which derive relevance scores directly from attention weights, offer an efficient and interpretable alternative to generation-based re-ranking methods. However, they still face two major limitations. First, attention signals are highly concentrated a small subset of tokens within a few documents, making others indistinguishable. Second, attention often overemphasizes phrases lexically similar to the query, yielding biased rankings that irrelevant documents with mere lexical resemblance are regarded as relevant. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{ReAttn}, a post-hoc re-weighting strategy for attention-based re-ranking methods. It first compute the cross-document IDF weighting to down-weight attention on query-overlapping tokens that frequently appear across the candidate documents, reducing lexical bias and emphasizing distinctive terms. It then employs entropy-based regularization to mitigate over-concentrated attention, encouraging a more balanced distribution across informative tokens. Both adjustments operate directly on existing attention weights without additional training or supervision.

Existing approaches either rely on multiple agents, incurring high coordination and resource costs, or adopt a single-agent paradigm, which overloads the agent with both global planning and local perception, often leading to degraded reasoning and instruction drift in long-horizon settings. To address these issues, we introduce DACo, a planning-grounding decoupled architecture that disentangles global deliberation from local grounding. Concretely, it employs a Global Commander for high-level strategic planning and a Local Operative for egocentric observing and fine-grained execution. By disentangling global reasoning from local action, DACo alleviates cognitive overload and improves long-horizon stability. The framework further integrates dynamic subgoal planning and adaptive replanning to enable structured and resilient navigation. Extensive evaluations on R2R, REVERIE, and R4R demonstrate that DACo achieves 4.9%, 6.5%, 5.4% absolute improvements over the best-performing baselines in zero-shot settings, and generalizes effectively across both closed-source (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source (e.g., Qwen-VL Series) backbones. DACo provides a principled and extensible paradigm for robust long-horizon navigation.

We introduce large-scale data curation pipelines and new benchmarks, compare modeling strategies, and show that modality fusion within a frozen text Matryoshka model performs best. Although trained only for retrieval, the model generalizes well to other tasks, such as speech intent detection, indicating the learning of general semantic representations.

A Bit-Model Dichotomy for Deep Network Training", "comment": null, "summary": "Theoretical analyses of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) are standardly framed within the Real-RAM model of computation. In this setting, training even simple neural networks is known to be $\\exists \\mathbb{R}$-complete -- a complexity class believed to be harder than NP, that characterizes the difficulty of solving systems of polynomial inequalities over the real numbers. However, this algebraic framework diverges from the reality of digital computation with finite-precision hardware. In this work, we analyze the theoretical complexity of ERM under a realistic bit-level model ($\\mathsf{ERM}_{\\text{bit}}$), where network parameters and inputs are constrained to be rational numbers with polynomially bounded bit-lengths. Under this model, we reveal a sharp dichotomy in tractability governed by the network's activation function. We prove that for deep networks with {\\em any} polynomial activations with rational coefficients and degree at least $2$, the bit-complexity of training is severe: deciding $\\mathsf{ERM}_{\\text{bit}}$ is $\\#P$-Hard, hence believed to be strictly harder than NP-complete problems. Furthermore, we show that determining the sign of a single partial derivative of the empirical loss function is intractable (unlikely in BPP), and deciding a specific bit in the gradient is $\\#P$-Hard. This provides a complexity-theoretic perspective for the phenomenon of exploding and vanishing gradients. In contrast, we show that for piecewise-linear activations such as ReLU, the precision requirements remain manageable: $\\mathsf{ERM}_{\\text{bit}}$ is contained within NP (specifically NP-complete), and standard backpropagation runs in polynomial time. Our results demonstrate that finite-precision constraints are not merely implementation details but fundamental determinants of learnability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Results show a clear improvement in AI model performance over time. Over nine months of 2025, model performance rose from the lower quartile of the human comparison group to approximately the top 5%. Around half of this improvement reflects steady advancement across successive model releases, while the remainder corresponds to a marked step change associated with reasoning-oriented model architectures.

Most existing approaches address these issues in a query-dependent manner, entangling table cleanup with reasoning and thus limiting generalization. We introduce QuIeTT, a query-independent table transformation framework that preprocesses raw tables into a single SQL-ready canonical representation before any test-time queries are observed.

However, conventional MIAs operate passively on fixed model weights, using log-likelihoods or text generations. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{Active Data Reconstruction Attack} (ADRA), a family of MIA that actively induces a model to reconstruct a given text through training. We hypothesize that training data are \\textit{more reconstructible} than non-members, and the difference in their reconstructibility can be exploited for membership inference. Motivated by findings that reinforcement learning (RL) sharpens behaviors already encoded in weights, we leverage on-policy RL to actively elicit data reconstruction by finetuning a policy initialized from the target model. To effectively use RL for MIA, we design reconstruction metrics and contrastive rewards. The resulting algorithms, \\textsc{ADRA} and its adaptive variant \\textsc{ADRA+}, improve both reconstruction and detection given a pool of candidate data. Experiments show that our methods consistently outperform existing MIAs in detecting pre-training, post-training, and distillation data, with an average improvement of 10.7\\% over the previous runner-up.

Such adaptability hinges on learning behavioural primitives once and recombining them through novel contexts without retraining. We establish metrics for compositional generalisation, propose hybrid architectures, and outline interdisciplinary research directions drawing on cognitive science and cultural evolution.

Although YOLOv8 provides reliable localization, the RGB-only model shows limited safety performance, achieving high precision (0.99) but low recall (0.49) due to insufficient ballast, as it tends to over-predict the sufficient class. To improve reliability, we incorporate depth-based geometric analysis enabled by a sleeper-aligned depth-correction pipeline that compensates for RealSense spatial distortion using polynomial modeling, RANSAC, and temporal smoothing. SAM2 segmentation further refines region-of-interest masks, enabling accurate extraction of sleeper and ballast profiles for geometric classification.\n  Experiments on field-collected top-down RGB-D data show that depth-enhanced configurations substantially improve the detection of insufficient ballast. Depending on bounding-box sampling (AABB or RBB) and geometric criteria, recall increases from 0.49 to as high as 0.80, and F1-score improves from 0.66 to over 0.80.

Although effective, this approach fails to leverage textual information in questions and responses, especially for open-ended questions. In this work, we propose GENCAT (\\textbf{GEN}erative \\textbf{CAT}), a novel CAT framework that leverages Large Language Models for knowledge estimate and question selection. First, we develop a Generative Item Response Theory (GIRT) model that enables us to estimate student knowledge from their open-ended responses and predict responses to unseen questions.

Second, we introduce three question selection algorithms that leverage the generative capabilities of the GIRT model, based on the uncertainty, linguistic diversity, and information of sampled student responses.

Generative AI has been explored to warm-start ILT, yet most approaches train deterministic image-to-image translators to mimic sub-optimal datasets, providing limited guidance for escaping non-convex traps during refinement. We reformulate mask synthesis as conditional sampling: a generator learns a distribution over masks conditioned on the design and proposes multiple candidates. The generator is first pretrained with WGAN plus a reconstruction loss, then fine-tuned using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with an ILT-guided imitation loss. At inference, we sample a small batch of masks, run fast batched ILT refinement, evaluate lithography metrics (e.g., EPE, process window), and select the best candidate. On \\texttt{LithoBench} dataset, the proposed hybrid framework reduces EPE violations under a 3\\,nm tolerance and roughly doubles throughput versus a strong numerical ILT baseline, while improving final mask quality.

It is known that such iterative feedback can lead to model collapse, yet the mechanisms underlying this degeneration remain poorly understood. Here we show that a broad class of feedback processes converges to a low-dimensional invariant structure in latent space, a phenomenon we call neural resonance. By modeling iterative feedback as a Markov Chain, we show that two conditions are needed for this resonance to occur: ergodicity of the feedback process and directional contraction of the latent representation. By studying diffusion models on MNIST and ImageNet, as well as CycleGAN and an audio feedback experiment, we map how local and global manifold geometry evolve, and we introduce an eight-pattern taxonomy of collapse behaviors.

Furthermore, prompting the model with accurate information about AI introspection mechanisms can dramatically strengthen this effect: the sensitivity to injection increases massively (0.3% -> 39.2%) with only a 0.6% increase in false positives. Also, mutual information between nine injected and recovered concepts rises from 0.62 bits to 1.05 bits, ruling out generic noise explanations.

Our experiments show that these modules pick up static image cues and very fast flicker changes, while overlooking medium-speed motion. Capturing dynamics across multiple time-scales is, however, crucial for fine-grained temporal analysis (i.e., opening vs. closing bottle).\n  To address this, we introduce Frame2Freq -- a family of frequency-aware adapters that perform spectral encoding during image-to-video adaptation of pretrained Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), improving fine-grained action recognition. Frame2Freq uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) along time and learns frequency-band specific embeddings that adaptively highlight the most discriminative frequency ranges. Across five fine-grained activity recognition datasets, Frame2Freq outperforms prior PEFT methods and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models on four of them. These results provide encouraging evidence that frequency analysis methods are a powerful tool for modeling temporal dynamics in image-to-video transfer.

These failures follow from the mathematics and incentives of scalarization and lead to \\textbf{structural} value flattening, \\textbf{normative} representation loss, and \\textbf{cognitive} uncertainty blindness. We introduce Edge Alignment as a distinct approach in which systems preserve multi dimensional value structure, support plural and democratic representation, and incorporate epistemic mechanisms for interaction and clarification. To make this approach practical, we propose seven interdependent pillars organized into three phases.

Regardless of their source, the downstream implication of intransitive preferences is the same: there is no well-defined optimal policy, breaking a core assumption of the standard PFT pipeline. In response, we propose a novel, game-theoretic solution concept -- the $\\textit{Maximum Entropy Blackwell Winner}$ ($\\textit{MaxEntBW}$) -- that is well-defined under multi-objective intransitive preferences. To enable computing MaxEntBWs at scale, we derive $\\texttt{PROSPER}$: a provably efficient PFT algorithm.

We then apply $\\texttt{PROSPER}$ to the problem of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) from multi-objective LLM-as-a-Judge feedback (e.g., rubric-based judges), a setting where both sources of intransitivity arise.

However, current systems waste computational resources by processing all modalities with fixed heavyweight ensembles regardless of input complexity. To address these limitations, we propose IDSelect, a reinforcement learning-based cost-aware selector that chooses one pre-trained model per modality per-sequence to optimize the accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Our key insight is that an input-conditioned selector can discover complementary model choices that surpass fixed ensembles while using substantially fewer resources. IDSelect trains a lightweight agent end-to-end using actor-critic reinforcement learning with budget-aware optimization. The reward balances recognition accuracy with computational cost, while entropy regularization prevents premature convergence. At inference, the policy selects the most probable model per modality and fuses modality-specific similarities for the final score. Extensive experiments on challenging video-based datasets demonstrate IDSelect's superior efficiency: on CCVID, it achieves 95.9% Rank-1 accuracy with 92.4% less computation than strong baselines while improving accuracy by 1.8%; on MEVID, it reduces computation by 41.3% while maintaining competitive performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "IDSelect\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u4eba\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8bc6\u522b", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u9891\u4eba\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u5165\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u65f6\u6d6a\u8d39\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIDSelect\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u9009\u62e9\u4e00\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u51c6\u786e\u6027-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861", "result": "\u5728CCVID\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523095.9%\u7684Rank-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u4f4e92.4%\uff0c\u5728MEVID\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u964d\u4f4e41.3%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b", "conclusion": "IDSelect\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387"}}

Given the probabilistic nature of modern LLMs, we assume a probabilistic model for these LLMs, following a constant random distribution and the source itself thus being stationary. We compare this source entropy (per word) to that of natural language (written or spoken) as represented by the Open American National Corpus (OANC).

From a theoretical perspective, the inverse distillation objective lacks uniqueness guarantees, which may lead to suboptimal solutions. From a practical standpoint, backpropagation in the discrete space is non-trivial and often unstable.

Previous methods accelerate sampling by caching and reusing intermediate outputs based on feature distances between adjacent timesteps.

This design overlooks spectral evolution, where low-frequency structure appears early and high-frequency detail is refined later. We introduce Spectral-Evolution-Aware Cache (SeaCache), a training-free cache schedule that bases reuse decisions on a spectrally aligned representation. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we derive a Spectral-Evolution-Aware (SEA) filter that preserves content-relevant components while suppressing noise. Employing SEA-filtered input features to estimate redundancy leads to dynamic schedules that adapt to content while respecting the spectral priors underlying the diffusion model.

The default assumption is that English is the best-performing language for LLMs, while smaller, low-resource languages are linked to less reliable outputs, even in multilingual, state-of-the-art models. To track variation in the comprehension abilities of LLMs, we prompt 3 popular models on a language comprehension task across 12 languages, representing the Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic, Turkic, Sino-Tibetan, and Japonic language families. Our results suggest that the models exhibit remarkable linguistic accuracy across typologically diverse languages, yet they fall behind human baselines in all of them, albeit to different degrees. Contrary to what was expected, English is not the best-performing language, as it was systematically outperformed by several Romance languages, even lower-resource ones.

Consequently, they are often ineffective for inherently unsupervised downstream tasks-such as time series anomaly detection (TSAD), which aims to identify rare, irregular patterns. This limitation arises because such abnormal patterns can closely resemble the regular patterns when presented in the same time/frequency domain. To address this issue, we introduce TimeRadar, an innovative TSFM built in a fractional time-frequency domain to support generalist TSAD across diverse unseen datasets. Our key insight is that rotating a time series into a data-dependent fractional time-frequency representation can adaptively differentiate the normal and abnormal signals across different datasets. To this end, a novel component, namely Fractionally modulated Time-Frequency Reconstruction (FTFRecon), is proposed in TimeRadar to leverage a learnable fractional order to rotate the time series to the most pronounced angle between a continuous time and frequency domain for accurate data reconstruction. This provides adaptive data reconstruction in an optimal time-frequency domain for each data input, enabling effective differentiation of the unbounded abnormal patterns from the regular ones across datasets, including unseen datasets.

Under review", "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) witness increasing deployment in complex, high-stakes decision-making scenarios, it becomes imperative to ground their reasoning in causality rather than spurious correlations. However, strong performance on traditional reasoning benchmarks does not guarantee true causal reasoning ability of LLMs, as high accuracy may still arise from memorizing semantic patterns instead of analyzing the underlying true causal structures. To bridge this critical gap, we propose a new causal reasoning benchmark, CausalFlip, designed to encourage the development of new LLM paradigm or training algorithms that ground LLM reasoning in causality rather than semantic correlation. CausalFlip consists of causal judgment questions built over event triples that could form different confounder, chain, and collider relations. Based on this, for each event triple, we construct pairs of semantically similar questions that reuse the same events but yield opposite causal answers, where models that rely heavily on semantic matching are systematically driven toward incorrect predictions. To further probe models' reliance on semantic patterns, we introduce a noisy-prefix evaluation that prepends causally irrelevant text before intermediate causal reasoning steps without altering the underlying causal relations or the logic of the reasoning process. We evaluate LLMs under multiple training paradigms, including answer-only training, explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, and a proposed internalized causal reasoning approach that aims to mitigate explicit reliance on correlation in the reasoning process. Our results show that explicit CoT can still be misled by spurious semantic correlations, where internalizing reasoning steps yields substantially improved causal grounding, suggesting that it is promising to better elicit the latent causal reasoning capabilities of base LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCausalFlip\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5185\u90e8\u5316\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u786e\u4fdd\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u590d\u6742\u3001\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6CausalFlip\uff0c\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u7531\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e09\u5143\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5224\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f62\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u3001\u94fe\u548c\u6df7\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5e26\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e4b\u524d\u6dfb\u52a0\u56e0\u679c\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6587\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u663e\u5f0fCoT\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u865a\u5047\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8bef\u5bfc\uff0c\u800c\u5185\u90e8\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u56e0\u679c\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6fc0\u53d1\u57faLLMs\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "CausalFlip\u57fa\u51c6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u5316\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002"}}

In realistic retrieval settings, the retrieved document set often contains a mixture of documents that vary in relevance and usefulness. While prior work has largely examined these phenomena through output behavior, little is known about how retrieved context shapes the internal representations that mediate information integration in RAG. In this work, we study RAG through the lens of latent representations. We systematically analyze how different types of retrieved documents affect the hidden states of LLMs, and how these internal representation shifts relate to downstream generation behavior.

Human-Centered Ensembles for Adaptive Human-AI Collaboration", "comment": "AAAI 2026", "summary": "In human-AI decision making, designing AI that complements human expertise has been a natural strategy to enhance human-AI collaboration, yet it often comes at the cost of decreased AI performance in areas of human strengths. This can inadvertently erode human trust and cause them to ignore AI advice precisely when it is most needed. Conversely, an aligned AI fosters trust yet risks reinforcing suboptimal human behavior and lowering human-AI team performance. In this paper, we start by identifying this fundamental tension between performance-boosting (i.e., complementarity) and trust-building (i.e., alignment) as an inherent limitation of the traditional approach for training a single AI model to assist human decision making. To overcome this, we introduce a novel human-centered adaptive AI ensemble that strategically toggles between two specialist AI models - the aligned model and the complementary model - based on contextual cues, using an elegantly simple yet provably near-optimal Rational Routing Shortcut mechanism. Comprehensive theoretical analyses elucidate why the adaptive AI ensemble is effective and when it yields maximum benefits. Moreover, experiments on both simulated and real-world data show that when humans are assisted by the adaptive AI ensemble in decision making, they can achieve significantly higher performance than when they are assisted by single AI models that are trained to either optimize for their independent performance or even the human-AI team performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94AI\u96c6\u6210\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4eba\u7c7b-AI\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u4e00AI\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u5373\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff09\u548c\u5efa\u7acb\u4fe1\u4efb\uff08\u5373\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4eba\u4e2d\u5fc3\u81ea\u9002\u5e94AI\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ebf\u7d22\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e1aAI\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e92\u8865\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u5730\u5207\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94AI\u96c6\u6210\u6709\u6548\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f55\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u5927\u6548\u76ca\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u65f6\u7531\u81ea\u9002\u5e94AI\u96c6\u6210\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bd4\u7531\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u80fd\u6216\u751a\u81f3\u4eba\u7c7b-AI\u56e2\u961f\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5355\u4e2aAI\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u65f6\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94AI\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4eba\u7c7b-AI\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Although verifier implementation is easier than solution annotation for many tasks, existing synthetic data generation methods remain largely solution-centric, while verifier-based methods rely on a few hand-crafted procedural environments. In this work, we scale RLVR by introducing ReSyn, a pipeline that generates diverse reasoning environments equipped with instance generators and verifiers, covering tasks such as constraint satisfaction, algorithmic puzzles, and spatial reasoning. A Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model trained with RL on ReSyn data achieves consistent gains across reasoning benchmarks and out-of-domain math benchmarks, including a 27\\% relative improvement on the challenging BBEH benchmark.

To this end, we introduce MoBind, a hierarchical contrastive learning framework designed to address three challenges: (1) filtering out irrelevant visual background, (2) modeling structured multi-sensor IMU configurations, and (3) achieving fine-grained, sub-second temporal alignment. To isolate motion-relevant cues, MoBind aligns IMU signals with skeletal motion sequences rather than raw pixels. We further decompose full-body motion into local body-part trajectories, pairing each with its corresponding IMU to enable semantically grounded multi-sensor alignment. To capture detailed temporal correspondence, MoBind employs a hierarchical contrastive strategy that first aligns token-level temporal segments, then fuses local (body-part) alignment with global (body-wide) motion aggregation. Evaluated on mRi, TotalCapture, and EgoHumans, MoBind consistently outperforms strong baselines across all four tasks, demonstrating robust fine-grained temporal alignment while preserving coarse semantic consistency across modalities.

Answering this question has been difficult because pre-training data is often a \"black box\" -- unknown or inaccessible. The recent release of nanochat -- a family of small LLMs with fully open pre-training data -- addresses this as it provides a transparent view into where a model's parametric knowledge comes from. Towards the goal of understanding how knowledge is encoded by LLMs, we release NanoKnow, a benchmark dataset that partitions questions from Natural Questions and SQuAD into splits based on whether their answers are present in nanochat's pre-training corpus. Using these splits, we can now properly disentangle the sources of knowledge that LLMs rely on when producing an output. To demonstrate NanoKnow's utility, we conduct experiments using eight nanochat checkpoints. Our findings show: (1) closed-book accuracy is strongly influenced by answer frequency in the pre-training data, (2) providing external evidence can mitigate this frequency dependence, (3) even with external evidence, models are more accurate when answers were seen during pre-training, demonstrating that parametric and external knowledge are complementary, and (4) non-relevant information is harmful, with accuracy decreasing based on both the position and the number of non-relevant contexts.

We further obtain predictive variance bounds (under a mild truncation approximation for the upper bound) and prove that they preserve the leading-order proportional-growth asymptotics known for RF models.

While watermarking offers a potential solution, existing methods often fail in complex scenarios where multiple concepts (e.g., an object and an artistic style) are composed within a single image. These methods struggle to disentangle and attribute each concept individually. In this work, we introduce TokenTrace, a novel proactive watermarking framework for robust, multi-concept attribution. Our method embeds secret signatures into the semantic domain by simultaneously perturbing the text prompt embedding and the initial latent noise that guide the diffusion model's generation process. For retrieval, we propose a query-based TokenTrace module that takes the generated image and a textual query specifying which concepts need to be retrieved (e.g., a specific object or style) as inputs. This query-based mechanism allows the module to disentangle and independently verify the presence of multiple concepts from a single generated image.

We instantiate KNIGHT on Wikipedia/Wikidata while keeping the framework domain- and ontology-agnostic. As a case study, KNIGHT produces six MCQ datasets in History, Biology, and Mathematics. We evaluate quality on five criteria: fluency, unambiguity (single correct answer), topic relevance, option uniqueness, and answerability given the provided sources (as a proxy for hallucination).

Most fairness constraints assume training labels reflect the true distribution, rendering them ineffective when labeling bias is present; leaving a challenging question, that \\textit{how can we detect such labeling bias?} In this work, we investigate whether influence functions can be used to detect labeling bias. Influence functions estimate how much each training sample affects a model's predictions by leveraging the gradient and Hessian of the loss function -- when labeling errors occur, influence functions can identify wrongly labeled samples in the training set, revealing the underlying failure mode. We develop a sample valuation pipeline and test it first on the MNIST dataset, then scaled to the more complex CheXpert medical imaging dataset. To examine label noise, we introduced controlled errors by flipping 20\\% of the labels for one class in the dataset.

To acquire more realistic textures, generative methods are often used to extract Physically-based Rendering (PBR) textures and materials from large collections of wild images and project them back onto garment meshes. However, most image-conditioned texture generation approaches require strict topological consistency between the input image and the input 3D mesh, or rely on accurate mesh deformation to match to the image poses, which significantly constrains the texture generation quality and flexibility. To address the challenging problem of non-isometric image-based garment texture generation, we construct 3D Garment Videos, a physically simulated, garment-centric dataset that provides consistent geometry and material supervision across diverse deformations, enabling robust cross-pose texture learning. We further employ Nano Banana for high-quality non-isometric image editing, achieving reliable cross-topology texture generation between non-isometric image-geometry pairs. Finally, we propose an iterative baking method via uncertainty-guided view selection and reweighting that fuses multi-view predictions into seamless, production-ready PBR textures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our feedforward dual-branch architecture generates versatile and spatially aligned PBR materials suitable for industry-level 3D garment design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u670d\u88c5\u89c6\u9891\u548cNano Banana\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u975e\u7b49\u8ddd\u56fe\u50cf-\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u884c\u4e1a\u7ea73D\u670d\u88c5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u903c\u771f\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a3D\u670d\u88c5\u7f51\u683c\u5df2\u7ecf\u8986\u76d6\u4e86\u5927\u591a\u6570\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u670d\u88c5\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7eb9\u7406\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e863D\u670d\u88c5\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u3001\u4ee5\u670d\u88c5\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5b83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u53d8\u5f62\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u6750\u6599\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8de8\u59ff\u6001\u7eb9\u7406\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u91c7\u7528\u4e86Nano Banana\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u975e\u7b49\u8ddd\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u975e\u7b49\u8ddd\u56fe\u50cf-\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8de8\u62d3\u6251\u7eb9\u7406\u751f\u6210\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8fed\u4ee3\u70d8\u7119\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u9884\u6d4b\u878d\u5408\u6210\u65e0\u7f1d\u3001\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u4ea7\u7684PBR\u7eb9\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u524d\u9988\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u884c\u4e1a\u7ea73D\u670d\u88c5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u591a\u624d\u591a\u827a\u4e14\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684PBR\u6750\u6599\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa3D\u670d\u88c5\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u91c7\u7528Nano Banana\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u975e\u7b49\u8ddd\u56fe\u50cf-\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u884c\u4e1a\u7ea73D\u670d\u88c5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods are invasive or stressful and may cause additional mortality, posing severe risks to threatened or endangered fish populations. To address these challenges, we propose FishProtoNet, a robust, non-invasive computer vision-based framework for sex identification of delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), an endangered fish species native to California, across its full life cycle. Unlike the traditional deep learning methods, FishProtoNet provides interpretability through learned prototype representations while improving robustness by leveraging foundation models to reduce the influence of background noise. Specifically, the FishProtoNet framework consists of three key components: fish regions of interest (ROIs) extraction using visual foundation model, feature extraction from fish ROIs and fish sex identification based on an interpretable prototype network. FishProtoNet demonstrates strong performance in delta smelt sex identification during early spawning and post-spawning stages, achieving the accuracies of 74.40% and 81.16% and corresponding F1 scores of 74.27% and 79.43% respectively. In contrast, delta smelt sex identification at the subadult stage remains challenging for current computer vision methods, likely due to less pronounced morphological differences in immature fish.

We address this problem by proposing a calibration framework that enhances predictive reliability while preserving the geometry of the pretrained CLIP embedding space, which is required for robust generalization. Our approach extends the standard cross-entropy loss with two complementary regularizers: (1) a mean-variance margin penalty that stabilizes inter-class logit margins by maximizing their average while minimizing dispersion, mitigating underconfidence and overconfidence spikes; and (2) a text moment-matching loss that aligns the first and second moments of tuned text embeddings with their frozen CLIP counterparts, preserving semantic dispersion crucial for generalization.

OpenVO effectively estimates real-world-scale ego-motion from monocular dashcam footage with varying observation rates and uncalibrated cameras, enabling robust trajectory dataset construction from rare driving events recorded in dashcam. Existing VO methods are trained on fixed observation frequency (e.g., 10Hz or 12Hz), completely overlooking temporal dynamics information. Many prior methods also require calibrated cameras with known intrinsic parameters. Consequently, their performance degrades when (1) deployed under unseen observation frequencies or (2) applied to uncalibrated cameras. These significantly limit their generalizability to many downstream tasks, such as extracting trajectories from dashcam footage. To address these challenges, OpenVO (1) explicitly encodes temporal dynamics information within a two-frame pose regression framework and (2) leverages 3D geometric priors derived from foundation models. We validate our method on three major autonomous-driving benchmarks - KITTI, nuScenes, and Argoverse 2 - achieving more than 20 performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches.

However, their application to text-guided image editing remains severely hampered, as forcing existing training-free editors into a single inference step fails. This failure manifests as severe object distortion and a critical loss of consistency in non-edited regions, resulting from the high-energy, erratic trajectories produced by naive vector arithmetic on the models' structured fields. To address this problem, we introduce ChordEdit, a model agnostic, training-free, and inversion-free method that facilitates high-fidelity one-step editing. We recast editing as a transport problem between the source and target distributions defined by the source and target text prompts. Leveraging dynamic optimal transport theory, we derive a principled, low-energy control strategy. This strategy yields a smoothed, variance-reduced editing field that is inherently stable, facilitating the field to be traversed in a single, large integration step.

However, due to its highly cursive forms and extensive glyph variations, most modern Japanese readers cannot directly interpret Kuzushiji characters. Therefore, recent research has focused on developing automated Kuzushiji character recognition methods, which have achieved satisfactory performance on relatively clean Kuzushiji document images. However, existing methods struggle to maintain recognition accuracy under seal interference (e.g., when seals overlap characters), despite the frequent occurrence of seals in pre-modern Japanese documents. To address this challenge, we propose a three-stage restoration-guided Kuzushiji character recognition (RG-KCR) framework specifically designed to mitigate seal interference. We construct datasets for evaluating Kuzushiji character detection (Stage 1) and classification (Stage 3). Experimental results show that the YOLOv12-medium model achieves a precision of 98.0% and a recall of 93.3% on the constructed test set. We quantitatively evaluate the restoration performance of Stage 2 using PSNR and SSIM. In addition, we conduct an ablation study to demonstrate that Stage 2 improves the Top-1 accuracy of Metom, a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based Kuzushiji classifier employed in Stage 3, from 93.45% to 95.33%.

To overcome these limitations, we present Ani3DHuman, a framework that marries kinematics-based animation with video diffusion priors. We first introduce a layered motion representation that disentangles rigid motion from residual non-rigid motion. Rigid motion is generated by a kinematic method, which then produces a coarse rendering to guide the video diffusion model in generating video sequences that restore the residual non-rigid motion. However, this restoration task, based on diffusion sampling, is highly challenging, as the initial renderings are out-of-distribution, causing standard deterministic ODE samplers to fail. Therefore, we propose a novel self-guided stochastic sampling method, which effectively addresses the out-of-distribution problem by combining stochastic sampling (for photorealistic quality) with self-guidance (for identity fidelity).

This framework, designed for two-layer neural networks, enables direct inspection of the knowledge encoded in the model weights. We reproduce baseline unlearning methods within the combinatorial interpretability setting and examine their behavior along two dimensions: (i) whether they truly remove knowledge of a target concept (the concept we wish to remove) or merely inhibit its expression while retaining the underlying information, and (ii) how easily the supposedly erased knowledge can be recovered through various fine-tuning operations.

However, their direct application to embedding-based tasks like retrieval remains challenging due to the discrepancy between output formats and optimization objectives. Previous approaches often employ contrastive fine-tuning to adapt MLLMs for retrieval, but at the cost of losing their generative capabilities. We argue that both generative and embedding tasks fundamentally rely on shared cognitive mechanisms, specifically cross-modal representation alignment and contextual comprehension. To this end, we propose CREM (Compression-driven Representation Enhanced Model), with a unified framework that enhances multimodal representations for retrieval while preserving generative ability. Specifically, we introduce a compression-based prompt design with learnable chorus tokens to aggregate multimodal semantics and a compression-driven training strategy that integrates contrastive and generative objectives through compression-aware attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CREM achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance on MMEB while maintaining strong generative performance on multiple comprehension benchmarks.

This paper presents the first independent evaluation of SAP's Retrieval Pretrained Transformer (RPT-1) from a practitioner perspective. RPT-1 is a compact 64.6 MB model pretrained on 1.34 TB of structured data across 3.1 million tables. We benchmark it against tuned gradient-boosted decision trees (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) on three SAP business scenarios: demand forecasting across SD/MM/PP modules, predictive data integrity in BC/MM/QM, and financial risk classification in FI/CO/AR. Across five-fold cross-validation on datasets ranging from 2,500 to 3,200 rows, RPT-1 reaches 91-96% of tuned GBDT accuracy without any training examples. The classification gap is modest at 3.6-4.1 percentage points on AUC-ROC, though regression tasks show wider gaps of 8.9-11.1 percentage points on R-squared. An interesting finding is a crossover at roughly 75-100 context rows where RPT-1 actually outperforms XGBoost under limited data. Based on these results, we propose a practical hybrid workflow: use RPT-1 for rapid screening, then train GBDT selectively where prediction accuracy justifies the effort.

However, building semantic correspondences for cross-category objects remains challenging and has received relatively little attention. To achieve this, we propose UniMatch, a semantic-aware, coarse-to-fine framework for constructing dense semantic correspondences between strongly non-isometric shapes without restricting object categories. The key insight is to lift \"coarse\" semantic cues into \"fine\" correspondence, which is achieved through two stages. In the \"coarse\" stage, we perform class-agnostic 3D segmentation to obtain non-overlapping semantic parts and prompt multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to identify part names. Then, we employ pretrained vision language models (VLMs) to extract text embeddings, enabling the construction of matched semantic parts. In the \"fine\" stage, we leverage these coarse correspondences to guide the learning of dense correspondences through a dedicated rank-based contrastive scheme. Thanks to class-agnostic segmentation, language guiding, and rank-based contrastive learning, our method is versatile for universal object categories and requires no predefined part proposals, enabling universal matching for inter-class and non-isometric shapes.

While vision-language models (VLMs) perform well in egocentric settings, their performance deteriorates when reasoning from allocentric viewpoints, where spatial relations must be inferred from the perspective of objects within the scene. In this study, we address this underexplored challenge by introducing Symbolic Projective Layout (SymPL), a framework that reformulates allocentric reasoning into symbolic-layout forms that VLMs inherently handle well. By leveraging four key factors-projection, abstraction, bipartition, and localization-SymPL converts allocentric questions into structured symbolic-layout representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this reformulation substantially improves performance in both allocentric and egocentric tasks, enhances robustness under visual illusions and multi-view scenarios, and that each component contributes critically to these gains.

Graph diffusion models have similarly been applied to combinatorial structure generation, including neural architecture search (NAS). However, neural architectures are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) where edge direction encodes functional semantics such as data flow-information that existing graph diffusion methods, designed for undirected structures, discard. We propose Directed Graph Policy Optimization (DGPO), which extends reinforcement learning fine-tuning of discrete graph diffusion models to DAGs via topological node ordering and positional encoding. Validated on NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201, DGPO matches the benchmark optimum on all three NAS-Bench-201 tasks (91.61%, 73.49%, 46.77%). The central finding is that the model learns transferable structural priors: pretrained on only 7% of the search space, it generates near-oracle architectures after fine-tuning, within 0.32 percentage points of the full-data model and extrapolating 7.3 percentage points beyond its training ceiling.

However, progress in this field has been significantly hindered by the lack of large-scale, geographically diverse, and publicly available benchmark datasets specifically designed for street trees. To address this critical gap, we introduce StreetTree, the world's first large-scale benchmark dataset dedicated to fine-grained street tree classification. The dataset contains over 12 million images covering more than 8,300 common street tree species, collected from urban streetscapes across 133 countries spanning five continents, and supplemented with expert-verified observational data. StreetTree poses substantial challenges for pretrained vision models under complex urban environments: high inter-species visual similarity, long-tailed natural distributions, significant intra-class variations caused by seasonal changes, and diverse imaging conditions such as lighting, occlusions from buildings, and varying camera angles.

However, tackling long-tail pattern recognition tasks remains challenging for current pre-trained foundation models such as LLMs and VLMs. While finetuning pre-trained models can improve accuracy in recognizing implicit patterns, it is usually infeasible due to a lack of training data and high computational overhead. In this paper, we propose ADAMAB, an efficient embedding calibration framework for few-shot pattern recognition. To maximally reduce the computational costs, ADAMAB trains embedder-agnostic light-weight calibrators on top of fixed embedding models without accessing their parameters. To mitigate the need for large-scale training data, we introduce an adaptive data augmentation strategy based on the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) mechanism. With a modified upper confidence bound algorithm, ADAMAB diminishes the gradient shifting and offers theoretically guaranteed convergence in few-shot training.

While spectral bias is often treated as an intrinsic representational limitation of neural architectures, its interaction with optimization dynamics and physics-based loss formulations remains poorly understood. In this work, we provide a systematic investigation of spectral bias in physics-informed and operator learning frameworks, with emphasis on the coupled roles of network architecture, activation functions, loss design, and optimization strategy. We quantify spectral bias through frequency-resolved error metrics, Barron-norm diagnostics, and higher-order statistical moments, enabling a unified analysis across elliptic, hyperbolic, and dispersive PDEs. Through diverse benchmark problems, including the Korteweg-de Vries, wave and steady-state diffusion-reaction equations, turbulent flow reconstruction, and earthquake dynamics, we demonstrate that spectral bias is not simply representational but fundamentally dynamical. In particular, second-order optimization methods substantially alter the spectral learning order, enabling earlier and more accurate recovery of high-frequency modes for all PDE types. For neural operators, we further show that spectral bias is dependent on the neural operator architecture and can also be effectively mitigated through spectral-aware loss formulations without increasing the inference cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Previous methods often use techniques such as diffusion models and adversarial learning to reduce the modality gap, but they typically focus on one-to-one alignment without exposing the data points of the source modality to the global distribution information of the target modality. To this end, leveraging the characteristic of rectified flow that can map one distribution to another via a straight trajectory, we extend rectified flow for modality distribution mapping. Specifically, we leverage the `one-to-many mapping' strategy in rectified flow that allows each data point of the source modality to observe the overall target distribution. This also alleviates the issue of insufficient paired data within each sample, enabling a more robust distribution transformation. Moreover, to achieve more accurate distribution mapping and address the ambiguous flow directions in one-to-many mapping, we design `adaptive relaxed alignment', enforcing stricter alignment for modality pairs belonging to the same sample, while applying relaxed mapping for pairs not belonging to the same sample or category. Additionally, to prevent information loss during distribution mapping, we introduce `cyclic rectified flow' to ensure the transferred features can be translated back to the original features, allowing multimodal representations to learn sufficient modality-specific information.

Policies tend to collapse onto a few reasoning patterns and prematurely stop deep exploration, while conventional entropy regularization introduces only local stochasticity and fails to induce meaningful path-level diversity, leading to weak and unstable learning signals in group-based policy optimization. We propose DSDR, a Dual-Scale Diversity Regularization reinforcement learning framework that decomposes diversity in LLM reasoning into global and coupling components. Globally, DSDR promotes diversity among correct reasoning trajectories to explore distinct solution modes. Locally, it applies a length-invariant, token-level entropy regularization restricted to correct trajectories, preventing entropy collapse within each mode while preserving correctness. The two scales are coupled through a global-to-local allocation mechanism that emphasizes local regularization for more distinctive correct trajectories. We provide theoretical support showing that DSDR preserves optimal correctness under bounded regularization, sustains informative learning signals in group-based optimization, and yields a principled global-to-local coupling rule. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in accuracy and pass@k, highlighting the importance of dual-scale diversity for deep exploration in RLVR.

This paper introduces CTS-Bench, a benchmark suite for systematically evaluating the trade-offs between graph coarsening, prediction accuracy, and computational efficiency in GNN-based CTS analysis. CTS-Bench consists of 4,860 converged physical design solutions spanning five architectures and provides paired raw gate-level and clustered graph representations derived from post-placement designs. Using clock skew prediction as a representative CTS task, we demonstrate a clear accuracy-efficiency trade-off. While graph coarsening reduces GPU memory usage by up to 17.2x and accelerates training by up to 3x, it also removes structural information essential for modeling clock distribution, frequently resulting in negative $R^2$ scores under zero-shot evaluation. Our findings indicate that generic graph clustering techniques can fundamentally compromise CTS learning objectives, even when global physical metrics remain unchanged.

Multi-modal AQA has recently achieved strong progress by leveraging complementary visual and kinematic cues, yet real-world deployments often suffer from non-stationary modality imbalance, where certain modalities become missing or intermittently available due to sensor failures or annotation gaps. Existing continual AQA methods overlook this issue and assume that all modalities remain complete and stable throughout training, which restricts their practicality. To address this challenge, we introduce Bridged Modality Adaptation (BriMA), an innovative approach to multi-modal continual AQA under modality-missing conditions. BriMA consists of a memory-guided bridging imputation module that reconstructs missing modalities using both task-agnostic and task-specific representations, and a modality-aware replay mechanism that prioritizes informative samples based on modality distortion and distribution drift. Experiments on three representative multi-modal AQA datasets (RG, Fis-V, and FS1000) show that BriMA consistently improves performance under different modality-missing conditions, achieving 6--8\\% higher correlation and 12--15\\% lower error on average.

However, perhaps not every component of a system needs to generalize. Training models for generalization typically produces entangled representations at the boundaries of entities or classes, which can lead to destructive interference when rapid, high-magnitude updates are required for continual or few-shot learning. Techniques for fast learning with non-interfering representations exist, but they generally fail to generalize. Here, we describe a Complementary Learning System (CLS) in which the fast learner entirely foregoes generalization in exchange for continual zero-shot and few-shot learning. Unlike most CLS approaches, which use episodic memory primarily for replay and consolidation, our fast, disentangled learner operates as a parallel reasoning system. The fast learner can overcome observation variability and uncertainty by leveraging a conventional slow, statistical learner within an active perception system: A contextual bias provided by the fast learner induces the slow learner to encode novel stimuli in familiar, generalized terms, enabling zero-shot and few-shot learning. This architecture demonstrates that fast, context-driven reasoning can coexist with slow, structured generalization, providing a pathway for robust continual learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u727a\u7272\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u6cdb\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e92\u8865\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08CLS\uff09", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u6cdb\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5e72\u6270", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u9014\u5f84"}}

Recent diffusion-based methods tackle this by generating various hypotheses, but often sacrifice accuracy. They yield predictions that are either physically implausible or drift from the input image, especially under occlusion or in cluttered, in-the-wild scenes. To address this, we introduce a dual-memory augmented HMR critique agent with self-reflection to produce context-aware quality scores for predicted meshes. These scores distill fine-grained cues about 3D human motion structure, physical feasibility, and alignment with the input image. We use these scores to build a group-wise HMR preference dataset. Leveraging this dataset, we propose a group preference alignment framework for finetuning diffusion-based HMR models. This process injects the rich preference signals into the model, guiding it to generate more physically plausible and image-consistent human meshes.

However, under limited supervision, prompt tuning alters pretrained representations and drives downstream features away from the pretrained manifold toward directions that are unfavorable for transfer. This drift degrades generalization. To address this limitation, we propose ManiPT, a framework that performs prompt tuning on the pretrained manifold. ManiPT introduces cosine consistency constraints in both the text and image modalities to confine the learned representations within the pretrained geometric neighborhood. Furthermore, we introduce a structural bias that enforces incremental corrections, guiding the adaptation along transferable directions to mitigate reliance on shortcut learning. From a theoretical perspective, ManiPT alleviates overfitting tendencies under limited data.

However, we argue that their conclusion, cautioning against cosine similarity in general, conflates the pathology of an incompatible training objective with the geometric validity of cosine distance on the unit sphere. We prove that when embeddings are constrained to the unit sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ (either during or after training with an appropriate objective), the $D$-matrix ambiguity vanishes identically, and cosine distance reduces to exactly half the squared Euclidean distance. This monotonic equivalence implies that cosine-based and Euclidean-based neighbor rankings are identical on normalized embeddings.

However, as they fundamentally record only relative intensity changes rather than absolute intensity, the resulting data streams suffer from a significant loss of spatial information and static texture details. In this paper, we address this limitation by leveraging the generative prior of a pre-trained video diffusion model to reconstruct high-fidelity video frames from sparse event data. Specifically, we first establish a baseline model by directly applying event data as a condition to synthesize videos. Then, based on the physical correlation between the event stream and video frames, we further introduce the event-based inter-frame residual guidance to enhance the accuracy of video frame reconstruction. Furthermore, we extend our method to video frame interpolation and prediction in a zero-shot manner by modulating the reverse diffusion sampling process, thereby creating a unified event-to-frame reconstruction framework. Experimental results on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively.

While current methods adapt CLIP by projecting 3D point clouds into 2D representations, they face challenges. The projection inherently loses some geometric details, and the reliance on a single 2D modality provides an incomplete visual understanding, limiting their ability to detect diverse anomaly types. To address these limitations, we propose the Geometry-Aware Prompt and Synergistic View Representation Learning (GS-CLIP) framework, which enables the model to identify geometric anomalies through a two-stage learning process. In stage 1, we dynamically generate text prompts embedded with 3D geometric priors. These prompts contain global shape context and local defect information distilled by our Geometric Defect Distillation Module (GDDM). In stage 2, we introduce Synergistic View Representation Learning architecture that processes rendered and depth images in parallel. A Synergistic Refinement Module (SRM) subsequently fuses the features of both streams, capitalizing on their complementary strengths.

Although general interactive segmentation models like SAM have achieved remarkable progress, their transfer to medical imaging still faces two key bottlenecks: (i) the lack of adaptive mechanisms for modality- and anatomy-specific tasks, which limits generalization in out-of-distribution medical scenarios; and (ii) current medical adaptation methods fine-tune on large, heterogeneous datasets without selection, leading to noisy supervision, higher cost, and negative transfer. To address these issues, we propose SegMoTE, an efficient and adaptive framework for medical image segmentation. SegMoTE preserves SAM's original prompt interface, efficient inference, and zero-shot generalization while introducing only a small number of learnable parameters to dynamically adapt across modalities and tasks.

However, current automatically generated questions tend to be simplistic and template-based, which hinders the deployment of question answering or visual dialogue systems for real-world applications. To enrich and diversify the questions with both image content and commonsense knowledge, we propose a Knowledge-aware Remote Sensing Visual Question Generation model (KRSVQG). The proposed model incorporates related knowledge triplets from external knowledge sources to broaden the question content, while employing image captioning as an intermediary representation to ground questions to the corresponding images. Moreover, KRSVQG utilizes a vision-language pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, enabling the model's adaptation to low data regimes. To evaluate the proposed KRSVQG model, we construct two knowledge-aware remote sensing visual question generation datasets: the NWPU-300 dataset and the TextRS-300 dataset. Evaluations, including metrics and human assessment, demonstrate that KRSVQG outperforms existing methods and leads to rich questions, grounded in both image and domain knowledge.

Controllable image editing can augment scarce labeled data, yet edits often introduce artifacts and entangle non-target attributes. We study this in facial expression analysis, targeting Action Unit (AU) manipulation where annotation is costly and AU co-activation drives entanglement. We present a facial manipulation method that operates in the semantic latent space of a pre-trained face generator (Diffusion Autoencoder). Using lightweight linear models, we reduce entanglement of semantic features via (i) dependency-aware conditioning that accounts for AU co-activation, and (ii) orthogonal projection that removes nuisance attribute directions (e.g., glasses), together with an expression neutralization step to enable absolute AU edit. We use these edits to balance AU occurrence by editing labeled faces and to diversify identities/demographics via controlled synthesis. Augmenting AU detector training with the generated data improves accuracy and yields more disentangled predictions with fewer co-activation shortcuts, outperforming alternative data-efficient training strategies and suggesting improvements similar to what would require substantially more labeled data in our learning-curve analysis.

In this work, we introduce PIS, a Physics-Informed System designed for robust metastable state partitioning. By integrating pre-computed physical priors, such as the radius of gyration and solvent-accessible surface area, into the extraction of topological features, our model achieves superior performance on the $A\u03b2_{42}$ dataset. Furthermore, PIS provides an interactive platform that features dynamic monitoring of physical characteristics and multi-dimensional result validation.

To enrich and diversify the questions, we propose a knowledge-aware remote sensing visual question generation model, KRSVQG, that incorporates external knowledge related to the image content to improve the quality and contextual understanding of the generated questions. The model takes an image and a related knowledge triplet from external knowledge sources as inputs and leverages image captioning as an intermediary representation to enhance the image grounding of the generated questions. To assess the performance of KRSVQG, we utilized two datasets that we manually annotated: NWPU-300 and TextRS-300.

Existing video anomaly detection (VAD) methods under perform in open-world scenarios. Key contributing factors include limited dataset diversity, and inadequate understanding of context-dependent anomalous semantics. To address these issues, i) we propose LAVIDA, an end-to-end zero-shot video anomaly detection framework. ii) LAVIDA employs an Anomaly Exposure Sampler that transforms segmented objects into pseudo-anomalies to enhance model adaptability to unseen anomaly categories. It further integrates a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to bolster semantic comprehension capabilities. Additionally, iii) we design a token compression approach based on reverse attention to handle the spatio-temporal scarcity of anomalous patterns and decrease computational cost. The training process is conducted solely on pseudo anomalies without any VAD data. Evaluations across four benchmark VAD datasets demonstrate that LAVIDA achieves SOTA performance in both frame-level and pixel-level anomaly detection under the zero-shot setting.

Bovik", "Divya Kothandaraman"], "title": "RegionRoute: Regional Style Transfer with Diffusion Model", "comment": null, "summary": "Precise spatial control in diffusion-based style transfer remains challenging. This challenge arises because diffusion models treat style as a global feature and lack explicit spatial grounding of style representations, making it difficult to restrict style application to specific objects or regions. To our knowledge, existing diffusion models are unable to perform true localized style transfer, typically relying on handcrafted masks or multi-stage post-processing that introduce boundary artifacts and limit generalization. To address this, we propose an attention-supervised diffusion framework that explicitly teaches the model where to apply a given style by aligning the attention scores of style tokens with object masks during training. Two complementary objectives, a Focus loss based on KL divergence and a Cover loss using binary cross-entropy, jointly encourage accurate localization and dense coverage. A modular LoRA-MoE design further enables efficient and scalable multi-style adaptation. To evaluate localized stylization, we introduce the Regional Style Editing Score, which measures Regional Style Matching through CLIP-based similarity within the target region and Identity Preservation via masked LPIPS and pixel-level consistency on unedited areas. Experiments show that our method achieves mask-free, single-object style transfer at inference, producing regionally accurate and visually coherent results that outperform existing diffusion-based editing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76d1\u7763\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e2d\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cbe\u786e\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u98ce\u683c\u89c6\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u98ce\u683c\u8868\u793a\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u5c06\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9650\u5236\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61\u6216\u533a\u57df\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5c06\u98ce\u683c\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f97\u5206\u4e0e\u5bf9\u8c61\u63a9\u7801\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u6559\u4f1a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u54ea\u91cc\u5e94\u7528\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u76ee\u6807\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eKL\u6563\u5ea6\u7684Focus\u635f\u5931\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u5143\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u7684Cover\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5171\u540c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684LoRA-MoE\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u98ce\u683c\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u533a\u57df\u98ce\u683c\u5316\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u533a\u57df\u98ce\u683c\u7f16\u8f91\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8be5\u5206\u6570\u901a\u8fc7CLIP\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u5185\u7684\u533a\u57df\u98ce\u683c\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801LPIPS\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5728\u672a\u7f16\u8f91\u533a\u57df\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u63a9\u7801\u3001\u5355\u4e2a\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u533a\u57df\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u9002\u5e94\u3002"}}

Unlike existing approaches that aggregate all units, often leading to cluttered saliency maps, our approach, DD-CAM, identifies a 1-minimal subset whose joint activation suffices to preserve the prediction (i.e., removing any unit from the subset alters the prediction). To efficiently isolate minimal sufficient subsets, we adapt delta debugging, a systematic reduction strategy from software debugging, and configure its search strategy based on unit interactions in the classifier head: testing individual units for models with non-interacting units and testing unit combinations for models in which unit interactions exist. We then generate minimal, prediction-preserving saliency maps that highlight only the most essential features. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach can produce more faithful explanations and achieve higher localization accuracy than the state-of-the-art CAM-based approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6DD-CAM\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u3001\u5145\u5206\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u3001\u5145\u5206\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDD-CAM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9694\u79bb\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5355\u5143\u5b50\u96c6\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5229\u7528delta debugging\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5934\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u5143\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u914d\u7f6e\u5176\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eCAM\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u3001\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "DD-CAM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u3001\u5145\u5206\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

A central limitation for deep conformal classifiers is that the nonconformity scores are derived from softmax outputs, which can be unreliable indicators of how certain the model truly is about a given input, sometimes leading to overconfident misclassifications or undue hesitation. In this work, we argue that this unreliability can be inherited by the prediction sets generated by CP, limiting their capacity for adaptiveness. We propose a new approach that leverages information from the pre-softmax logit space, using the Helmholtz Free Energy as a measure of model uncertainty and sample difficulty. By reweighting nonconformity scores with a monotonic transformation of the energy score of each sample, we improve their sensitivity to input difficulty. Our experiments with four state-of-the-art score functions on multiple datasets and deep architectures show that this energy-based enhancement improves the adaptiveness of the prediction sets, leading to a notable increase in both efficiency and adaptiveness compared to baseline nonconformity scores, without introducing any post-hoc complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u7b26\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u7b26\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e2d\u975e\u7b26\u5408\u6027\u5206\u6570\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u9884softmax\u5bf9\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea5\u59c6\u970d\u5179\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u975e\u7b26\u5408\u6027\u5206\u6570\u4e0e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u6570\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u6362\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u975e\u7b26\u5408\u6027\u5206\u6570\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u6ca1\u6709\u5f15\u5165\u4efb\u4f55\u4e8b\u540e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u7b26\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Applying world models to simulate the contrast enhancement kinetics in the human body enables continuous contrast-free dynamics. However, the low temporal resolution in MRI acquisition restricts the training of world models, leading to a sparsely sampled dataset. Directly training a generative model to capture the kinetics leads to two limitations: (a) Due to the absence of data on missing time, the model tends to overfit to irrelevant features, leading to content distortion. (b) Due to the lack of continuous temporal supervision, the model fails to learn the continuous kinetics law over time, causing temporal discontinuities. For the first time, we propose MRI Contrast Enhancement Kinetics World model (MRI CEKWorld) with SpatioTemporal Consistency Learning (STCL). For (a), guided by the spatial law that patient-level structures remain consistent during enhancement, we propose Latent Alignment Learning (LAL) that constructs a patient-specific template to constrain contents to align with this template. For (b), guided by the temporal law that the kinetics follow a consistent smooth trend, we propose Latent Difference Learning (LDL) which extends the unobserved intervals by interpolation and constrains smooth variations in the latent space among interpolated sequences.

However, this strategy exhibits two inherent limitations. First, it suppresses noise only in the chest wall and bone regions while leaving the image background untreated. Second, it lacks a dedicated mechanism for denoising the lung parenchyma. To address these issues, we systematically redesign the original image purification strategy and propose an improved version termed IPv2. The proposed strategy introduces three core modules, namely Remove Background, Add noise, and Remove noise. These modules endow the model with denoising capability in both background and lung tissue regions during training data construction and provide a more reasonable evaluation protocol through refined label construction at the testing stage. Extensive experiments on our previously established real-world patient lung CT dataset acquired at 2% radiation dose demonstrate that IPv2 consistently improves background suppression and lung parenchyma restoration across multiple mainstream denoising models.

However, its reliance on autoregressive pseudo-labelling makes training expensive, while its decoupled supervision of CTC and attention branches increases susceptibility to self-reinforcing errors, particularly under distribution shifts involving longer sequences, noise, or unseen domains. We propose CTC-driven teacher forcing, where greedily decoded CTC pseudo-labels are fed into the decoder to generate attention targets in a single forward pass. Although these can be globally incoherent, in the pseudo-labelling setting they enable efficient and effective knowledge transfer. Because CTC and CTC-driven attention pseudo-labels have the same length, the decoder can predict both simultaneously, benefiting from the robustness of CTC and the expressiveness of attention without costly beam search. We further propose mixed sampling to mitigate the exposure bias of the decoder relying solely on CTC inputs.

While deep learning approaches often focus on temporal interpolation or complex architectures to handle irregularities, we propose a simpler yet effective alternative: extracting time-agnostic summary statistics to eliminate the temporal axis. Our method computes four key features per variable-mean and standard deviation of observed values, as well as the mean and variability of changes between consecutive observations to create a fixed-dimensional representation. These features are then utilized with standard classifiers, such as logistic regression and XGBoost. Evaluated on four biomedical datasets (PhysioNet Challenge 2012, 2019, PAMAP2, and MIMIC-III), our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing recent transformer and graph-based models by 0.5-1.7% in AUROC/AUPRC and 1.1-1.7% in accuracy/F1-score, while reducing computational complexity. Ablation studies demonstrate that feature extraction-not classifier choice-drives performance gains, and our summary statistics outperform raw/imputed input in most benchmarks. In particular, we identify scenarios where missing patterns themselves encode predictive signals, as in sepsis prediction (PhysioNet, 2019), where missing indicators alone can achieve 94.2% AUROC with XGBoost, only 1.6% lower than using original raw data as input.

Arnold", "William Speier"], "title": "US-JEPA: A Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture for Medical Ultrasound", "comment": null, "summary": "Ultrasound (US) imaging poses unique challenges for representation learning due to its inherently noisy acquisition process. The low signal-to-noise ratio and stochastic speckle patterns hinder standard self-supervised learning methods relying on a pixel-level reconstruction objective. Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) address this drawback by predicting masked latent representations rather than raw pixels. However, standard approaches depend on hyperparameter-brittle and computationally expensive online teachers updated via exponential moving average. We propose US-JEPA, a self-supervised framework that adopts the Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training (SALT) objective. By using a frozen, domain-specific teacher to provide stable latent targets, US-JEPA decouples student-teacher optimization and pushes the student to expand upon the semantic priors of the teacher.

However, recent studies reveal its vulnerability to adversarial corruptions in input views, where imperceptible yet consistent perturbations can drastically degrade rendering quality, increase training and rendering time, and inflate memory usage, even leading to server denial-of-service. In our work, to mitigate this issue, we begin by analyzing the distinct behaviors of adversarial perturbations in the low- and high-frequency components of input images using wavelet transforms. Based on this observation, we design a simple yet effective frequency-aware defense strategy that reconstructs training views by filtering high-frequency noise while preserving low-frequency content. This approach effectively suppresses adversarial artifacts while maintaining the authenticity of the original scene. Notably, it does not significantly impair training on clean data, achieving a desirable trade-off between robustness and performance on clean inputs. Through extensive experiments under a wide range of attack intensities on multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method substantially enhances the robustness of 3DGS without access to clean ground-truth supervision.

Inspired by speculative decoding in language model inference and by the Automatically Scalable Computation (ASC) architecture for program execution, Leap+Verify decomposes training into three dynamically detected regimes (chaotic, transition, stable) using activation-space cosine similarity as a real-time Lyapunov proxy signal. Within each regime, analytic weight predictors (momentum, linear, quadratic extrapolation) attempt to forecast model parameters K training steps ahead; predictions are accepted only when validated against a held-out loss criterion. We evaluate Leap+Verify on GPT-2 124M and Qwen 2.5-1.5B trained on WikiText-103 across five random seeds, sweeping prediction depth K in {5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100}. Momentum-based prediction (Adam moment extrapolation) fails catastrophically at both scales, with predicted losses exceeding actuals by 100-10,000x -- a universal norm explosion in optimizer-state extrapolation. Finite-difference predictors (linear, quadratic) succeed where momentum fails: at 124M, they achieve 24% strict acceptance at K=5 in stable regimes; at 1.5B, they achieve 37% strict acceptance in transition regimes. The scale-dependent finding is in regime distribution: GPT-2 124M spends 34% of training in stable regime, while Qwen 1.5B spends 64% in chaotic regime and reaches stable in only 0-2 of 40 checkpoints. Larger models are more predictable when predictable, but less often predictable -- the practical bottleneck shifts from predictor accuracy to regime availability. Cross-seed results are highly consistent (less than 1% validation loss variance), and the three-regime framework produces identical phase boundaries (plus or minus 50 steps) across seeds.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent methods improve attack effectiveness by leveraging future rewards to guide adversarial perturbation generation over sequential time steps (i.e., reward-based attacks). However, these methods are unable to capture dependencies between different time steps in the perturbation generation process, resulting in a weak temporal correlation between the current perturbation and previous perturbations.In this paper, we propose a novel method called Advantage-based Adversarial Transformer (AAT), which can generate adversarial examples with stronger temporal correlations (i.e., time-correlated adversarial examples) to improve the attack performance. AAT employs a multi-scale causal self-attention (MSCSA) mechanism to dynamically capture dependencies between historical information from different time periods and the current state, thus enhancing the correlation between the current perturbation and the previous perturbation. Moreover, AAT introduces a weighted advantage mechanism, which quantifies the effectiveness of a perturbation in a given state and guides the generation process toward high-performance adversarial examples by sampling high-advantage regions.

Under adverse conditions, degradation or failure of the camera sensor can significantly compromise the reliability of the perception system. To address this problem, we introduce UP-Fuse, a novel uncertainty-aware fusion framework in the 2D range-view that remains robust under camera sensor degradation, calibration drift, and sensor failure. Raw LiDAR data is first projected into the range-view and encoded by a LiDAR encoder, while camera features are simultaneously extracted and projected into the same shared space. At its core, UP-Fuse employs an uncertainty-guided fusion module that dynamically modulates cross-modal interaction using predicted uncertainty maps. These maps are learned by quantifying representational divergence under diverse visual degradations, ensuring that only reliable visual cues influence the fused representation. The fused range-view features are decoded by a novel hybrid 2D-3D transformer that mitigates spatial ambiguities inherent to the 2D projection and directly predicts 3D panoptic segmentation masks.

Within this context, rapid and accurate plume shine dose estimation serves as a practical test case, as it is critical for nuclear facility safety assessment and radiological emergency response, while conventional photon-transport-based calculations remain computationally expensive. In this work, an interpolation-assisted ML framework was developed using discrete dose datasets generated with the pyDOSEIA suite for 17 gamma-emitting radionuclides across varying downwind distances, release heights, and atmospheric stability categories. The datasets were augmented using shape-preserving interpolation to construct dense, high-resolution training data. Two tree-based ML models (Random Forest and XGBoost) and one deep learning (DL) model (TabNet) were evaluated to examine predictive performance and sensitivity to dataset resolution. All models showed higher prediction accuracy with the interpolated high-resolution dataset than with the discrete data; however, XGBoost consistently achieved the highest accuracy. Interpretability analysis using permutation importance (tree-based models) and attention-based feature attribution (TabNet) revealed that performance differences stem from how the models utilize input features. Tree-based models focus mainly on dominant geometry-dispersion features (release height, stability category, and downwind distance), treating radionuclide identity as a secondary input, whereas TabNet distributes attention more broadly across multiple variables. For practical deployment, a web-based GUI was developed for interactive scenario evaluation and transparent comparison with photon-transport reference calculations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d2\u503c\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1\u70df\u7fbd\u5242\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u6838\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ML\uff09\u5728\u4ee3\u7528\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a00\u7f3a\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u8f90\u5c04\u5242\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u70df\u7fbd\u5242\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6838\u8bbe\u65bd\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u5b50\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5219\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u5242\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u63d2\u503c\u8f85\u52a9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7531pyDOSEIA\u5957\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e17\u79cd\u4f3d\u9a6c\u53d1\u5c04\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u6838\u7d20\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4e0b\u98ce\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u91ca\u653e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u548c\u5927\u6c14\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5f62\u72b6\u4fdd\u6301\u63d2\u503c\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u548cXGBoost\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08TabNet\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u68c0\u9a8c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63d2\u503c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5747\u9ad8\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u7136\u800c\uff0cXGBoost\u59cb\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6392\u5217\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\uff08TabNet\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u6e90\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4e3b\u5bfc\u51e0\u4f55-\u6269\u6563\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u91ca\u653e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u4e0b\u98ce\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u6838\u7d20\u8eab\u4efd\u89c6\u4e3a\u6b21\u8981\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u800cTabNet\u5219\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0a\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5730\u5206\u914d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eWeb\u7684GUI\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4e0e\u5149\u5b50\u4f20\u8f93\u53c2\u8003\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u900f\u660e\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d2\u503c\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1\u70df\u7fbd\u5242\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u6838\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Yet, most existing approaches operate on entire images holistically, limiting the ability to isolate and manipulate individual scene elements. In contrast, layered representations, where scenes are explicitly separated into objects, environmental context, and visual effects, provide a more intuitive and structured framework for interpreting and editing visual content. To bridge this gap and enable both compositional understanding and controllable editing, we introduce the Referring Layer Decomposition (RLD) task, which predicts complete RGBA layers from a single RGB image, conditioned on flexible user prompts, such as spatial inputs (e.g., points, boxes, masks), natural language descriptions, or combinations thereof. At the core is the RefLade, a large-scale dataset comprising 1.11M image-layer-prompt triplets produced by our scalable data engine, along with 100K manually curated, high-fidelity layers.

High-confidence detections trigger semantic resets that overwrite corrupted tracker memory, effectively mitigating drift accumulation with a training-free foundation tracker in complex endoscopic scenes. On emergency intubation videos, CL-MC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing drift and missing rate compared with the SAM2 variants and open loop based methods.

A Sampler-Centric Evaluation of Discrete Diffusion Language Models", "comment": "28 pages, 9 figures", "summary": "Discrete diffusion language models (dLLMs) provide a fast and flexible alternative to autoregressive models (ARMs) via iterative denoising with parallel updates. However, their evaluation is challenging: existing metrics conflate denoiser approximation error with sampler-induced error from the sampling dynamics, a problem that does not arise for ARMs whose autoregressive sampling exactly reflects the learned probability model. We introduce a sampler-centric oracle framework that replaces learned denoisers with an exact Hidden Markov Model posterior derived from a ground-truth Markov chain, isolating sampler-induced error in a controlled setting. We show that few-step discrete diffusion samplers are not distributionally correct even under an oracle denoiser, with transition-level mismatch that vanishes only as the number of steps approaches the sequence length. Moreover, improvements in negative log-likelihood, generative perplexity, or MAUVE do not imply correct sampling.

One reason is the conventional down-sampling techniques that prioritize computational efficiency at the expense of information retention. This paper introduces a simple but effective strategy, we call it Stair Pooling, which moderates the pace of down-sampling and reduces information loss by leveraging a sequence of concatenated small and narrow pooling operations in varied orientations. Specifically, our method modifies the reduction in dimensionality within each 2D pooling step from $\\frac{1}{4}$ to $\\frac{1}{2}$. This approach can also be adapted for 3D pooling to preserve even more information. Such preservation aids the U-Net in more effectively reconstructing spatial details during the up-sampling phase, thereby enhancing its ability to capture long-range information and improving segmentation accuracy.

Prior white-box attacks rarely generalize across tasks, and black-box methods depend on expensive transfer, which limits efficiency. The vision encoder, standardized and often shared across LVLMs, provides a stable gray-box pivot with strong cross-model transfer. Building on this premise, we introduce PA-Attack (Prototype-Anchored Attentive Attack). PA-Attack begins with a prototype-anchored guidance that provides a stable attack direction towards a general and dissimilar prototype, tackling the attribute-restricted issue and limited task generalization of vanilla attacks. Building on this, we propose a two-stage attention enhancement mechanism: (i) leverage token-level attention scores to concentrate perturbations on critical visual tokens, and (ii) adaptively recalibrate attention weights to track the evolving attention during the adversarial process. Extensive experiments across diverse downstream tasks and LVLM architectures show that PA-Attack achieves an average 75.1% score reduction rate (SRR), demonstrating strong attack effectiveness, efficiency, and task generalization in LVLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hefeimei06/PA-Attack.", "code_url": "https://github.com/hefeimei06/PA-Attack", "code_stars": 1, "code_last_update": "2026-02-22", "AI": {"tldr": "PA-Attack\uff1a\u9488\u5bf9LVLMs\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u5f97\u5206\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPA-Attack\uff08\u539f\u578b\u951a\u5b9a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u653b\u51fb\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u539f\u578b\u951a\u5b9a\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "PA-Attack\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u548cLVLM\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u574775.1%\u7684\u5f97\u5206\u964d\u4f4e\u7387\uff08SRR\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PA-Attack\u662fLVLMs\u4e2d\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, the prevalent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) strategies often demonstrate limited and biased performance, which hinders their practical applications. In this study, we explore sparse points and local human preferences as weak labels in the target domain, thereby presenting a more realistic yet annotation-efficient setting. Specifically, we develop Prefer-DAS, which pioneers sparse promptable learning and local preference alignment. The Prefer-DAS is a promptable multitask model that integrates self-training and prompt-guided contrastive learning. Unlike SAM-like methods, the Prefer-DAS allows for the use of full, partial, and even no point prompts during both training and inference stages and thus enables interactive segmentation. Instead of using image-level human preference alignment for segmentation, we introduce Local direct Preference Optimization (LPO) and sparse LPO (SLPO), plug-and-play solutions for alignment with spatially varying human feedback or sparse feedback. To address potential missing feedback, we also introduce Unsupervised Preference Optimization (UPO), which leverages self-learned preferences. As a result, the Prefer-DAS model can effectively perform both weakly-supervised and unsupervised DAS, depending on the availability of points and human preferences. Comprehensive experiments on four challenging DAS tasks demonstrate that our model outperforms SAM-like methods as well as unsupervised and weakly-supervised DAS methods in both automatic and interactive segmentation modes, highlighting strong generalizability and flexibility.

A practical alternative is to synthesize pseudo TIR data via image translation; however, most RGB-to-TIR approaches heavily rely on RGB-centric priors that overlook thermal physics, yielding implausible heat distributions. In this paper, we introduce TherA, a controllable RGB-to-TIR translation framework that produces diverse and thermally plausible images at both scene and object level. TherA couples TherA-VLM with a latent-diffusion-based translator. Given a single RGB image and a user-prompted condition pair, TherA-VLM yields a thermal-aware embedding that encodes scene, object, material, and heat-emission context reflecting the input scene-condition pair. Conditioning the diffusion model on this embedding enables realistic TIR synthesis and fine-grained control across time of day, weather, and object state. Compared to other baselines, TherA achieves state-of-the-art translation performance, demonstrating improved zero-shot translation performance up to 33% increase averaged across all metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "TherA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684RGB\u5230TIR\u8f6c\u6362\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408TherA-VLM\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u903c\u771f\u7684TIR\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916\u6210\u50cf\uff08TIR\uff09\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u4ecd\u7136\u662fTIR\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u751f\u6210\u4f2aTIR\u6570\u636e\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570RGB\u5230TIR\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56RGB\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u70ed\u7269\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u70ed\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86TherA\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u63a7\u7684RGB\u5230TIR\u8f6c\u6362\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u573a\u666f\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ea7\u522b\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u70ed\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002TherA\u5c06TherA-VLM\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u7ed9\u5b9a\u5355\u4e2aRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5bf9\uff0cTherA-VLM\u4ea7\u751f\u4e00\u4e2a\u70ed\u611f\u77e5\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u8be5\u5d4c\u5165\u7f16\u7801\u573a\u666f\u3001\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001\u6750\u6599\u548c\u70ed\u8f90\u5c04\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u573a\u666f-\u6761\u4ef6\u5bf9\u3002\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u903c\u771f\u7684TIR\u5408\u6210\u548c\u5bf9\u4e00\u5929\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u5929\u6c14\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cTherA\u5728\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6240\u6709\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8633%\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "TherA\u6846\u67b6\u5728RGB\u5230TIR\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u4e3aTIR\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this work, we study a minimal continual learning agent designed to isolate representational dynamics from architectural complexity and optimization objectives. The agent maintains a persistent state vector across executions and incrementally updates it as new textual data is introduced. We quantify representational change using cosine similarity between successive normalized state vectors and define a stability metric over time intervals. Longitudinal experiments across eight executions reveal a transition from an initial plastic regime to a stable representational regime under consistent input. A deliberately introduced semantic perturbation produces a bounded decrease in similarity, followed by recovery and restabilization under subsequent coherent input. These results demonstrate that meaningful stability plasticity tradeoffs can emerge in a minimal, stateful learning system without explicit regularization, replay, or architectural complexity. The work establishes a transparent empirical baseline for studying representational accumulation and adaptation in continual learning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8868\u5f81\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u6743\u8861", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u79cd\u65e8\u5728\u9694\u79bb\u8868\u5f81\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u67b6\u6784\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u8be5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u6267\u884c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e00\u4e2a\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u968f\u7740\u65b0\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u800c\u589e\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u5b83", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3001\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3001\u91cd\u653e\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u590d\u6742\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8868\u5f81\u79ef\u7d2f\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u900f\u660e\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u57fa\u7ebf"}}

While current approaches allow users to specify what to count via inclusion prompts, they often struggle in cluttered scenes with confusable object categories, leading to ambiguity and overcounting. CountEx enables users to express both inclusion and exclusion intent, specifying what to count and what to ignore, through multimodal prompts including natural language descriptions and optional visual exemplars. At the core of CountEx is a novel Discriminative Query Refinement module, which jointly reasons over inclusion and exclusion cues by first identifying shared visual features, then isolating exclusion-specific patterns, and finally applying selective suppression to refine the counting query. To support systematic evaluation of fine-grained counting methods, we introduce CoCount, a benchmark comprising 1,780 videos and 10,086 annotated frames across 97 category pairs. Experiments show that CountEx achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods for counting objects from both known and novel categories.

We propose PaReGTA, an LLM-based encoding framework that (i) converts longitudinal EHR events into visit-level templated text with explicit temporal cues, (ii) learns domain-adapted visit embeddings via lightweight contrastive fine-tuning of a sentence-embedding model, and (iii) aggregates visit embeddings into a fixed-dimensional patient representation using hybrid temporal pooling that captures both recency and globally informative visits. Because PaReGTA does not require training from scratch but instead utilizes a pre-trained LLM, it can perform well even in data-limited cohorts. Furthermore, PaReGTA is model-agnostic and can benefit from future EHR-specialized sentence-embedding models. For interpretability, we introduce PaReGTA-RSS (Representation Shift Score), which quantifies clinically defined factor importance by recomputing representations after targeted factor removal and projecting representation shifts through a machine learning model.

While recent detectors improve accuracy by stacking feature extractors or introducing heavy attention modules, they often incur substantial computational overhead and, more importantly, neglect the physics that fundamentally limits UFD: wavelength-dependent absorption and turbidity-induced scattering significantly degrade contrast, blur fine structures, and introduce backscattering noise, leading to unreliable localization and recognition. To address these challenges, we propose FinSight-Net, an efficient and physics-aware detection framework tailored for complex aquaculture environments. FinSight-Net introduces a Multi-Scale Decoupled Dual-Stream Processing (MS-DDSP) bottleneck that explicitly targets frequency-specific information loss via heterogeneous convolutional branches, suppressing backscattering artifacts while compensating distorted biological cues through scale-aware and channel-weighted pathways. We further design an Efficient Path Aggregation FPN (EPA-FPN) as a detail-filling mechanism: it restores high-frequency spatial information typically attenuated in deep layers by establishing long-range skip connections and pruning redundant fusion routes, enabling robust detection of non-rigid fish targets under severe blur and turbidity. Extensive experiments on DeepFish, AquaFishSet, and our challenging UW-BlurredFish benchmark demonstrate that FinSight-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance. In particular, on UW-BlurredFish, FinSight-Net reaches 92.8% mAP, outperforming YOLOv11s by 4.8% while reducing parameters by 29.0%, providing a strong and lightweight solution for real-time automated monitoring in smart aquaculture.", "AI": {"tldr": "FinSight-Net\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6c34\u4e0b\u9c7c\u7c7b\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6c34\u4ea7\u517b\u6b96\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c34\u4e0b\u9c7c\u7c7b\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08UFD\uff09\u5bf9\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u6c34\u4ea7\u517b\u6b96\u548c\u6d77\u6d0b\u751f\u6001\u76d1\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86UFD\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u9650\u5236\u56e0\u7d20\uff1a\u6ce2\u957f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5438\u6536\u548c\u6d51\u6d4a\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\uff0c\u6a21\u7cca\u7ec6\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u540e\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FinSight-Net\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u6c34\u4ea7\u517b\u6b96\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u3002FinSight-Net\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u89e3\u8026\u53cc\u6d41\u5904\u7406\uff08MS-DDSP\uff09\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6784\u5377\u79ef\u5206\u652f\u660e\u786e\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u9891\u7387\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u540e\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c3a\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u901a\u9053\u52a0\u6743\u8def\u5f84\u8865\u507f\u626d\u66f2\u7684\u751f\u7269\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u805a\u5408FPN\uff08EPA-FPN\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ec6\u8282\u586b\u5145\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u526a\u679d\u5197\u4f59\u878d\u5408\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u6df1\u5c42\u4e2d\u901a\u5e38\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u6d51\u6d4a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u521a\u6027\u9c7c\u7c7b\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728DeepFish\u3001AquaFishSet\u548cUW-BlurredFish\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8868\u660eFinSight-Net\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728UW-BlurredFish\u4e0a\uff0cFinSight-Net\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8692.8%\u7684mAP\uff0c\u6bd4YOLOv11s\u9ad84.8%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8629.0%\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u6c34\u4ea7\u517b\u6b96\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "FinSight-Net\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6c34\u4e0b\u9c7c\u7c7b\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

A fundamental challenge is that high-throughput single-cell sequencing is destructive: the same cell cannot be observed both before and after a perturbation. Thus, perturbation prediction requires mapping unpaired control and perturbed populations. Existing models address this by learning maps between distributions, but typically assume a single fixed response distribution when conditioned on observed cellular context (e.g., cell type) and the perturbation type. In reality, responses vary systematically due to unobservable latent factors such as microenvironmental fluctuations and complex batch effects, forming a manifold of possible distributions for the same observed conditions. To account for this variability, we introduce PerturbDiff, which shifts modeling from individual cells to entire distributions. By embedding distributions as points in a Hilbert space, we define a diffusion-based generative process operating directly over probability distributions. This allows PerturbDiff to capture population-level response shifts across hidden factors. Benchmarks on established datasets show that PerturbDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-cell response prediction and generalizes substantially better to unseen perturbations.

We show that for subjective perception tasks, this alignment can be achieved without any model training: VLMs are already strong concept extractors but poor decision calibrators, and the gap can be closed externally. We propose a training-free post-hoc concept-bottleneck pipeline consisting of three tightly coupled stages: concept mining, multi-agent structured scoring, and geometric calibration, unified by an end-to-end dimension optimization loop. Interpretable evaluation dimensions are mined from a handful of human annotations; an Observer-Debater-Judge chain extracts robust continuous concept scores from a frozen VLM; and locally-weighted ridge regression on a hybrid visual-semantic manifold calibrates these scores against human ratings. Applied to urban perception as UrbanAlign, the framework achieves 72.2% accuracy ($\u03ba=0.45$) on Place Pulse 2.0 across six categories, outperforming the best supervised baseline by +15.1 pp and uncalibrated VLM scoring by +16.3 pp, with full dimension-level interpretability and zero model-weight modification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u6316\u6398\u3001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86VLM\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8fd9\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u548cGPU\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u540e\u671f\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u4e2a\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u6982\u5ff5\u6316\u6398\u3001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u5faa\u73af\u7edf\u4e00\u3002", "result": "\u5728UrbanAlign\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u57ce\u5e02\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728Place Pulse 2.0\u7684\u516d\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8672.2%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08$\u03ba=0.45$\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u4f73\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf+15.1\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u672a\u6821\u51c6\u7684VLM\u8bc4\u5206+16.3\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u96f6\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u4fee\u6539\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e3b\u89c2\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0cVLM\u662f\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u4f46\u8f83\u5dee\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6821\u51c6\u5668\uff0c\u5dee\u8ddd\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f25\u8865\u3002"}}

Although unrolling is known to yield asymptotically correct Jacobians under suitable conditions, recent work has shown that the derivative iterates may initially diverge from the true Jacobian, a phenomenon known as the curse of unrolling. In this work, we provide a non-asymptotic analysis that explains the origin of this behavior and identifies the algorithmic factors that govern it. We show that truncating early iterations of the derivative computation mitigates the curse while simultaneously reducing memory requirements. Finally, we demonstrate that warm-starting in bilevel optimization naturally induces an implicit form of truncation, providing a practical remedy.

Existing adaptation methods modify the continuous feature interface between encoder and language model through projector tuning or other parameter-efficient updates, which still couples the two components and requires re-alignment whenever the encoder changes. We introduce CRAFT (Codebook RegulAted Fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that fine-tunes the encoder using a discrete codebook that anchors visual representations to a stable token space, achieving domain adaptation without modifying other parts of the model. This decoupled design allows the adapted encoder to seamlessly boost the performance of LVLMs with different language architectures, as long as they share the same codebook.

In safety-critical medical segmentation, this lack of selectivity often causes the tumor mask to spill into healthy brain tissue or degrades predictions that were already correct. We propose Hypothesis-Driven TTA, a novel framework that reformulates adaptation as a dynamic decision process. Rather than forcing a single optimization trajectory, our method generates intuitive competing geometric hypotheses: compaction (is the prediction noisy? trim artifacts) versus inflation (is the valid tumor under-segmented? safely inflate to recover). It then employs a representation-guided selector to autonomously identify the safest outcome based on intrinsic texture consistency. Additionally, a pre-screening Gatekeeper prevents negative transfer by skipping adaptation on confident cases. We validate this proof-of-concept on a cross-domain binary brain tumor segmentation task, applying a source model trained on adult BraTS gliomas to unseen pediatric and more challenging meningioma target domains. HD-TTA improves safety-oriented outcomes (Hausdorff Distance (HD95) and Precision) over several state-of-the-art representative baselines in the challenging safety regime, reducing the HD95 by approximately 6.4 mm and improving Precision by over 4%, while maintaining comparable Dice scores.

Our approach decomposes images into Laplacian pyramid residuals and processes different scales in parallel through a mixture-of-transformers (MoT) architecture with causal attention mechanisms. Unlike previous cascaded approaches that require explicit renoising between scales, our model generates multi-scale representations in parallel, eliminating the need for bridging processes. The proposed multi-scale architecture not only improves generation quality but also accelerates the sampling process and promotes scaling flow matching methods. Through extensive experimentation on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet, we demonstrate that our method achieves superior sample quality with fewer GFLOPs and faster inference compared to single-scale and multi-scale flow matching baselines.

Optical metrology techniques such as deflectometry achieve high accuracy but typically rely on multi-shot acquisition, making them unsuitable for dynamic environments. Fourier-based single-shot approaches alleviate this constraint, yet their performance deteriorates when measuring surfaces with high spatial frequency structure or large curvature. Alternatively, polarimetric 3D imaging in computer vision operates in a single-shot fashion and exhibits robustness to geometric complexity. However, its accuracy is fundamentally limited by the orthographic imaging assumption. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework for single-shot 3D imaging of complex specular surfaces. Polarization cues provide orientation priors that assist in interpreting geometric information encoded by structured illumination. These complementary cues are processed through a dual-encoder architecture with mutual feature modulation, allowing the network to resolve their nonlinear coupling and directly infer surface normals.

We propose a causally-aware Bayesian meta-learning method, by conditioning task-specific priors on precomputed latent causal task embeddings, enabling transfer based on mechanistic similarity rather than spurious correlations. Our approach explicitly considers realistic deployment settings where access to target-task data is limited, and adaptation relies on noisy (expert-provided) pairwise judgments of causal similarity between source and target tasks. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that conditioning on causal embeddings controls prior mismatch and mitigates negative transfer under task shift. Empirically, we demonstrate reductions in negative transfer and improved out-of-distribution adaptation in both controlled simulations and a large-scale real-world clinical prediction setting for cross-disease transfer, where causal embeddings align with underlying clinical mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u56e0\u679c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u4efb\u52a1\u5d4c\u5165\u63a7\u5236\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u51cf\u8f7b\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "Meta-learning methods\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u7ecf\u5e38\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ece\u6e90\u4efb\u52a1\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u8d77\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u56e0\u679c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u4efb\u52a1\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0a\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5236\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6765\u81ea\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u5173\u4e8e\u6e90\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6210\u5bf9\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0a\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u79fb\u65f6\u7684\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u56e0\u679c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u673a\u5236\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u56e0\u679c\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u7684\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Taking into account that conventional SFDA methods are inevitably error-prone under domain shift, recently greater attention has been directed to SFDA assisted with off-the-shelf foundation models, e.g., vision-language (ViL) models. However, existing works of leveraging ViL models for SFDA confront two issues: (i) Although mutual information is exploited to consider the joint distribution between the predictions of ViL model and the target model, we argue that the forgetting of some superior predictions of the target model still occurs, as indicated by the decline of the accuracies of certain classes during adaptation; (ii) Prior research disregards the rich, fine-grained knowledge embedded in the ViL model, which offers detailed grounding for fundus image diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce a novel forgetting-resistant and lesion-aware (FRLA) method for SFDA of fundus image diagnosis with ViL model. Specifically, a forgetting-resistant adaptation module explicitly preserves the confident predictions of the target model, and a lesion-aware adaptation module yields patch-wise predictions from ViL model and employs them to help the target model be aware of the lesion areas and leverage the ViL model's fine-grained knowledge. Extensive experiments show that our method not only significantly outperforms the vision-language model, but also achieves consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.

For long, progress has been equated with ever-larger datasets, driving remarkable advances but now yielding increasingly diminishing performance gains alongside rising energy use and carbon emissions.

We argue that this gap between preach and practice must be closed, as continued data scaling entails substantial and under-accounted environmental impacts. To ground our position, we provide indicative estimates of the energy use and carbon emissions associated with the downstream use of ImageNet-1K. We then present empirical evidence that data frugality is both practical and beneficial, demonstrating that coreset-based subset selection can substantially reduce training energy consumption with little loss in accuracy, while also mitigating dataset bias.

However, while models like Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image show emerging abilities to reason over multiple related images, existing benchmarks rarely address the challenges of multi-image context generation, focusing mainly on text-to-image or single-image editing tasks. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{MICON-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark covering six tasks that evaluate cross-image composition, contextual reasoning, and identity preservation. We further propose an MLLM-driven Evaluation-by-Checkpoint framework for automatic verification of semantic and visual consistency, where multimodal large language model (MLLM) serves as a verifier. Additionally, we present \\textbf{Dynamic Attention Rebalancing (DAR)}, a training-free, plug-and-play mechanism that dynamically adjusts attention during inference to enhance coherence and reduce hallucinations. Extensive experiments on various state-of-the-art open-source models demonstrate both the rigor of MICON-Bench in exposing multi-image reasoning challenges and the efficacy of DAR in improving generation quality and cross-image coherence.

Recent forecasting-based caching approaches employ temporal extrapolation techniques to approximate the output features with cached ones. Although effective, relying exclusively on temporal extrapolation still suffers from significant prediction errors, leading to performance degradation. Through a detailed analysis, we find that 1) these errors stem from the irregular magnitude of changes in the output features, and 2) an input feature of a module is strongly correlated with the corresponding output. Based on this, we propose relational feature caching (RFC), a novel framework that leverages the input-output relationship to enhance the accuracy of the feature prediction. Specifically, we introduce relational feature estimation (RFE) to estimate the magnitude of changes in the output features from the inputs, enabling more accurate feature predictions. We also present relational cache scheduling (RCS), which estimates the prediction errors using the input features and performs full computations only when the errors are expected to be substantial. Extensive experiments across various DiT models demonstrate that RFC consistently outperforms prior approaches significantly.

However, translating spectra into full molecular structures is a difficult, under-defined inverse problem. Overcoming this problem is crucial for enabling biological insight, discovering new metabolites, and advancing chemical research across multiple fields. To this end, we develop MSFlow, a two-stage encoder-decoder flow-matching generative model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the structure elucidation task for small molecules. In the first stage, we adopt a formula-restricted transformer model for encoding mass spectra into a continuous and chemically informative embedding space, while in the second stage, we train a decoder flow matching model to reconstruct molecules from latent embeddings of mass spectra.

However, CP systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks where malicious agents forge false objects via feature-level perturbations. Current defensive systems use threshold-based consensus verification by comparing collaborative and ego detection results. Yet, these defenses remain vulnerable to more sophisticated attack strategies that could exploit two critical weaknesses: (i) lack of robustness against attacks with systematic timing and target region optimization, and (ii) inadvertent disclosure of vulnerability knowledge through implicit confidence information in shared collaboration data. In this paper, we propose MVIG attack, a novel adaptive adversarial CP framework learning to capture vulnerability knowledge disclosed by different defensive CP systems from a unified mutual view information graph (MVIG) representation. Our approach combines MVIG representation with temporal graph learning to generate evolving fabrication risk maps and employs entropy-aware vulnerability search to optimize attack location, timing and persistence, enabling adaptive attacks with generalizability across various defensive configurations. Extensive evaluations on OPV2V and Adv-OPV2V datasets demonstrate that MVIG attack reduces defense success rates by up to 62\\% against state-of-the-art defenses while achieving 47\\% lower detection for persistent attacks at 29.9 FPS, exposing critical security gaps in CP systems.

In this work, we investigate the distinct emergent mechanisms that arise when training AR versus Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models, such as Discrete Diffusion Models (dLLMs), on lookahead tasks. By requiring the models to plan ahead to reach the correct conclusion, we analyze how these two paradigms fundamentally differ in their approach to the problem. We identify a critical asymmetry in planning problems: while forward generation requires complex lookahead at branching junctions, reverse generation is often deterministic. This asymmetry creates an opportunity for NAR models. Through mechanistic analysis of training and inference dynamics, we demonstrate that NAR models learn to solve planning tasks by utilizing future tokens to decode backwards, avoiding the need to learn complex traversal mechanisms entirely. Consequently, we report that both AR and NAR models are able to achieve perfect accuracy on the lookahead task.

However, existing methods that project all modalities into a single latent space for fusion often overlook the asynchronous, multi-level semantic structure of multimodal data. This oversight induces semantic misalignment and error propagation, thereby degrading representation quality. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Level Co-Representation (CLCR), which explicitly organizes each modality's features into a three-level semantic hierarchy and specifies level-wise constraints for cross-modal interactions. First, a semantic hierarchy encoder aligns shallow, mid, and deep features across modalities, establishing a common basis for interaction. And then, at each level, an Intra-Level Co-Exchange Domain (IntraCED) factorizes features into shared and private subspaces and restricts cross-modal attention to the shared subspace via a learnable token budget. This design ensures that only shared semantics are exchanged and prevents leakage from private channels. To integrate information across levels, the Inter-Level Co-Aggregation Domain (InterCAD) synchronizes semantic scales using learned anchors, selectively fuses the shared representations, and gates private cues to form a compact task representation. We further introduce regularization terms to enforce separation of shared and private features and to minimize cross-level interference.

We present a scalable and satellite-based pipeline to detect looted archaeological sites, using PlanetScope monthly mosaics (4.7m/pixel) and a curated dataset of 1,943 archaeological sites in Afghanistan (898 looted, 1,045 preserved) with multi-year imagery (2016--2023) and site-footprint masks. We compare (i) end-to-end CNN classifiers trained on raw RGB patches and (ii) traditional machine learning (ML) trained on handcrafted spectral/texture features and embeddings from recent remote-sensing foundation models. Results indicate that ImageNet-pretrained CNNs combined with spatial masking reach an F1 score of 0.926, clearly surpassing the strongest traditional ML setup, which attains an F1 score of 0.710 using SatCLIP-V+RF+Mean, i.e., location and vision embeddings fed into a Random Forest with mean-based temporal aggregation. Ablation studies demonstrate that ImageNet pretraining (even in the presence of domain shift) and spatial masking enhance performance. In contrast, geospatial foundation model embeddings perform competitively with handcrafted features, suggesting that looting signatures are extremely localized.

We propose CURE, a framework that advances counterfactual survival modeling via comprehensive multimodal embedding and latent subgroup retrieval. CURE integrates clinical, paraclinical, demographic, and multi-omics information, which are aligned and fused through cross-attention mechanisms. Complex multi-omics signals can be adaptively refined using a mixture-of-experts architecture, emphasizing the most informative omics components. Building upon this representation, CURE implicitly retrieves patient-specific latent subgroups that capture both baseline survival dynamics and treatment-dependent variations. Experimental results on METABRIC and TCGA-LUAD datasets demonstrate that proposed CURE model consistently outperforms strong baselines in survival analysis, evaluated using the Time-dependent Concordance Index ($C^{td}$) and Integrated Brier Score (IBS). These findings highlight the potential of CURE to enhance multimodal understanding and serve as a foundation for future treatment recommendation models.

While prior efforts alleviate this issue by retrieving additional data or introducing stronger vision encoders, these methods are still computationally intensive during finetuning VLMs and don't fully exploit the original training data. In this paper, we introduce an efficient plug-and-play module that substantially improves VLMs' reasoning over rare objects by refining visual tokens and enriching input text prompts, without VLMs finetuning. Specifically, we propose to learn multi-modal class embeddings for rare objects by leveraging prior knowledge from vision foundation models and synonym-augmented text descriptions, compensating for limited training examples. These embeddings refine the visual tokens in VLMs through a lightweight attention-based enhancement module that improves fine-grained object details. In addition, we use the learned embeddings as object-aware detectors to generate informative hints, which are injected into the text prompts to help guide the VLM's attention toward relevant image regions. Experiments on two benchmarks show consistent and substantial gains for pretrained VLMs in rare object recognition and reasoning. Further analysis reveals how our method strengthens the VLM's ability to focus on and reason about rare objects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8VLMs\u5bf9\u7f55\u89c1\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7f55\u89c1\u7269\u4f53\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u7f55\u89c1\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u7136\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8VLMs\u5bf9\u7f55\u89c1\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9VLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u7f55\u89c1\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7c7b\u522b\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4ee5\u8865\u507f\u6709\u9650\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u793a\u4f8b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5d4c\u5165\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u7ec6\u5316VLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6765\u751f\u6210\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u6ce8\u5165\u5230\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u5f15\u5bfcVLM\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5230\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684VLMs\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5728\u7f55\u89c1\u7269\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u663e\u8457\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u52a0\u5f3aVLM\u5173\u6ce8\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7f55\u89c1\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86VLMs\u5728\u7f55\u89c1\u7269\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u7f55\u89c1\u7269\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Existing methods are either unsupervised or semi-supervised: unsupervised methods avoid the need for labeled anomalies but often produce ambiguous boundary, whereas semi-supervised methods can overfit to the limited labeled anomalies and generalize poorly to unseen anomalies. To address this gap, we consider a largely underexplored problem in DGAD: learning a discriminative boundary from normal/unlabeled data, while leveraging limited labeled anomalies \\textbf{when available} without sacrificing generalization to unseen anomalies. To this end, we propose an effective, generalizable, and model-agnostic framework with three main components: (i) residual representation encoding that capture deviations between current interactions and their historical context, providing anomaly-relevant signals; (ii) a restriction loss that constrain the normal representations within an interval bounded by two co-centered hyperspheres, ensuring consistent scales while keeping anomalies separable; (iii) a bi-boundary optimization strategy that learns a discriminative and robust boundary using the normal log-likelihood distribution modeled by a normalizing flow. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework across diverse evaluation settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08DGAD\uff09\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bb8\u591a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u662f\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u662f\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u7684\uff1a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6807\u8bb0\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u4ea7\u751f\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u800c\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u6cdb\u5316\u8f83\u5dee\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08DGAD\uff09\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4ece\u6b63\u5e38/\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u5224\u522b\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u727a\u7272\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5f02\u5e38\uff08\u5f53\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\uff09\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\uff08i\uff09\u6b8b\u5dee\u8868\u793a\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u6355\u83b7\u5f53\u524d\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u5176\u5386\u53f2\u80cc\u666f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f02\u5e38\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\uff08ii\uff09\u4e00\u4e2a\u9650\u5236\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5c06\u6b63\u5e38\u8868\u793a\u7ea6\u675f\u5728\u7531\u4e24\u4e2a\u5171\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8d85\u7403\u4f53\u754c\u5b9a\u7684\u533a\u95f4\u5185\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f02\u5e38\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\uff1b\uff08iii\uff09\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u8fb9\u754c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7531\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u5206\u5e03\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u5224\u522b\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u3002\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u6b8b\u5dee\u8868\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u9650\u5236\u635f\u5931\u548c\u53cc\u8fb9\u754c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4ece\u6b63\u5e38/\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5224\u522b\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

The first two authors contributed equally", "summary": "Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have seen rapid and widespread adoption. However, their powerful generative capabilities raise concerns about potential misuse for synthesizing harmful, private, or copyrighted content. To mitigate such risks, concept erasure techniques have emerged as a promising solution. Prior works have primarily focused on fine-tuning the denoising component (e.g., the U-Net backbone). However, recent causal tracing studies suggest that visual attribute information is localized in the early self-attention layers of the text encoder, indicating a potential alternative for concept erasing. Building on this insight, we conduct preliminary experiments and find that directly fine-tuning early layers can suppress target concepts but often degrades the generation quality of non-target concepts. To overcome this limitation, we propose High-Level Representation Misdirection (HiRM), which misdirects high-level semantic representations of target concepts in the text encoder toward designated vectors such as random directions or semantically defined directions (e.g., supercategories), while updating only early layers that contain causal states of visual attributes. Our decoupling strategy enables precise concept removal with minimal impact on unrelated concepts, as demonstrated by strong results on UnlearnCanvas and NSFW benchmarks across diverse targets (e.g., objects, styles, nudity).

Addressing this challenge requires safety mechanisms that are both practically effective and supported by rigorous theory. We introduce BarrierSteer, a novel framework that formalizes response safety by embedding learned non-linear safety constraints directly into the model's latent representation space. BarrierSteer employs a steering mechanism based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to efficiently detect and prevent unsafe response trajectories during inference with high precision. By enforcing multiple safety constraints through efficient constraint merging, without modifying the underlying LLM parameters, BarrierSteer preserves the model's original capabilities and performance. We provide theoretical results establishing that applying CBFs in latent space offers a principled and computationally efficient approach to enforcing safety.

Building upon this setting, we propose FedTAR, a framework that integrates demographic-driven personalization with time-aware global aggregation.

Traditional volumetric fusion techniques, including truncated signed distance functions (TSDF), enable efficient and deterministic geometry reconstruction; however, they depend on heuristic weighting and fail to transparently convey uncertainty in a systematic way. Recent neural implicit methods, on the other hand, get very high fidelity but usually need a lot of GPU power for optimization and aren't very easy to understand for making decisions later on. This work presents BayesFusion-SDF, a CPU-centric probabilistic signed distance fusion framework that conceptualizes geometry as a sparse Gaussian random field with a defined posterior distribution over voxel distances. First, a rough TSDF reconstruction is used to create an adaptive narrow-band domain. Then, depth observations are combined using a heteroscedastic Bayesian formulation that is solved using sparse linear algebra and preconditioned conjugate gradients. Randomized diagonal estimators are a quick way to get an idea of posterior uncertainty. This makes it possible to extract surfaces and plan the next best view while taking into account uncertainty. Tests on a controlled ablation scene and a CO3D object sequence show that the new method is more accurate geometrically than TSDF baselines and gives useful estimates of uncertainty for active sensing. The proposed formulation provides a clear and easy-to-use alternative to GPU-heavy neural reconstruction methods while still being able to be understood in a probabilistic way and acting in a predictable way.

This paradigm can lead to overfitting to dominant reward signals, while neglecting alternative yet valid reasoning trajectories, thereby limiting diversity and exploration. To address this issue, we introduce Learning Advantage Distributions (LAD), a distribution-matching framework that replaces advantage maximization with learning the advantage-induced distribution. By establishing the equivalence between the optimal policy update and an advantage-based target distribution, we derive a practical LAD objective formulated as minimizing an $f$-divergence between the policy-induced and advantage-induced distributions. This yields a gradient update that increases likelihood for high-advantage responses while suppressing over-confident probability growth, preventing collapse without requiring auxiliary entropy regularization.

We present a training-free approach that enhances existing indirect and direct HDR reconstruction methods through diffusion-based inpainting. Our method combines text-guided diffusion models with SDEdit refinement to generate plausible content in over-exposed areas while maintaining consistency across multi-exposure LDR images. Unlike previous approaches requiring extensive training, our method seamlessly integrates with existing HDR reconstruction techniques through an iterative compensation mechanism that ensures luminance coherence across multiple exposures. We demonstrate significant improvements in both perceptual quality and quantitative metrics on standard HDR datasets and in-the-wild captures.

To obtain less biased and more reliable models under such scarcity, practitioners leverage diffusion models to supplement underrepresented regions of real data. Specifically, recent studies fine-tune pretrained diffusion models with LoRA on few-shot real sets to synthesize additional images. While an image-wise LoRA trained on a single image captures fine-grained details yet offers limited diversity, a class-wise LoRA trained over all shots produces diverse images as it encodes class priors yet tends to overlook fine details. To combine both benefits, we separate the adapter into a class-shared LoRA~$A$ for class priors and per-image LoRAs~$\\mathcal{B}$ for image-specific characteristics. To expose coherent class semantics in the shared LoRA~$A$, we propose a semantic boosting by preserving class bounding boxes during training. For generation, we compose $A$ with a mixture of $\\mathcal{B}$ using coefficients drawn from a Dirichlet distribution.

Since these models typically rely on VLM backbones optimized for Visual Question Answering (VQA), they excel at semantic identification but often overlook subtle 3D state variations that dictate distinct action patterns.\n  To resolve these misalignments, we propose Pose-VLA, a decoupled paradigm that separates VLA training into a pre-training phase for extracting universal 3D spatial priors in a unified camera-centric space, and a post-training phase for efficient embodiment alignment within robot-specific action space.

The reasoning judge attains very high correlation with human ratings and 98.9\\% percent pairwise agreement on the human-annotated meta-evaluation subset. These results establish reasoning fidelity as a quantifiable dimension of deepfake detection and demonstrate scalable supervision for interpretable deepfake reasoning. Our user study shows that participants preferred the reasonings generated by our framework 70\\% of the time, in terms of faithfulness, groundedness, and usefulness, compared to those produced by other models and datasets.

We introduce Flose, a generative method that infers object poses via a denoising process conditioned on local features. While prior approaches based on conditional flow matching perform denoising solely based on geometric guidance, Flose integrates appearance-based semantic features to mitigate ambiguities caused by object symmetries. We further incorporate RANSAC-based registration to handle outliers. We validate Flose on five datasets from the established BOP benchmark.

Recent unified synthesis models have enabled flexible synthesis tasks by accommodating various input-output configurations. However, their training and evaluation are typically restricted to a single dataset, limiting their generalizability across diverse clinical datasets and impeding practical deployment. To address this limitation, we propose PMM-Synth, a personalized MRI synthesis framework that not only supports various synthesis tasks but also generalizes effectively across heterogeneous datasets. PMM-Synth is jointly trained on multiple multi-modal MRI datasets that differ in modality coverage, disease types, and intensity distributions. It achieves cross-dataset generalization through three core innovations: a Personalized Feature Modulation module that dynamically adapts feature representations based on dataset identifier to mitigate the impact of distributional shifts; a Modality-Consistent Batch Scheduler that facilitates stable and efficient batch training under inconsistent modality conditions; and a selective supervision loss to ensure effective learning when ground truth modalities are partially missing. Evaluated on four clinical multi-modal MRI datasets, PMM-Synth consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both one-to-one and many-to-one synthesis tasks, achieving superior PSNR and SSIM scores.

While inter-modality fusion of camera and LiDAR data in multimodal place recognition (MPR) has shown promise in overcoming the limitations of unimodal counterparts, existing MPR methods basically attend to hand-crafted fusion strategies and heavily parameterized backbones that require costly retraining. To address this, we propose VGGT-MPR, a multimodal place recognition framework that adopts the Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) as a unified geometric engine for both global retrieval and re-ranking. In the global retrieval stage, VGGT extracts geometrically-rich visual embeddings through prior depth-aware and point map supervision, and densifies sparse LiDAR point clouds with predicted depth maps to improve structural representation. This enhances the discriminative ability of fused multimodal features and produces global descriptors for fast retrieval. Beyond global retrieval, we design a training-free re-ranking mechanism that exploits VGGT's cross-view keypoint-tracking capability. By combining mask-guided keypoint extraction with confidence-aware correspondence scoring, our proposed re-ranking mechanism effectively refines retrieval results without additional parameter optimization. Extensive experiments on large-scale autonomous driving benchmarks and our self-collected data demonstrate that VGGT-MPR achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong robustness to severe environmental changes, viewpoint shifts, and occlusions.

However, the iterative refinement and densification process leads to the generation of a large number of primitives, each contributing to the reconstruction to a substantially different extent. Estimating primitive importance is thus crucial, both for removing redundancy during reconstruction and for enabling efficient compression and transmission. Existing methods typically rely on rendering-based analyses, where each primitive is evaluated through its contribution across multiple camera viewpoints. However, such methods are sensitive to the number and selection of views, rely on specialized differentiable rasterizers, and have long calculation times that grow linearly with view count, making them difficult to integrate as plug-and-play modules and limiting scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose RAP, a fast feedforward rendering-free attribute-guided method for efficient importance score prediction in 3DGS. RAP infers primitive significance directly from intrinsic Gaussian attributes and local neighborhood statistics, avoiding rendering-based or visibility-dependent computations. A compact MLP predicts per-primitive importance scores using rendering loss, pruning-aware loss, and significance distribution regularization.

Prior efforts in dataset filtering and pruning attempt to mitigate this issue, but still require relatively large subsets to maintain performance and fail under very small subsets. Dataset distillation offers a promising alternative, yet existing multimodal dataset distillation methods require full-dataset training and joint optimization of image pixels and text features, making them architecture-dependent and limiting cross-architecture generalization. To overcome this, we propose a learning-free dataset distillation framework that eliminates the need for large-scale training and optimization while enhancing generalization across architectures. Our method uses CLIP to extract aligned image-text embeddings, obtains prototypes, and employs an unCLIP decoder to synthesize images, enabling efficient and scalable multimodal dataset distillation.

In this work, we first demonstrate that such models fail to generalize, performing poorly on common industrial objects.

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong potential in analyzing tampered images and generating interpretations. However, they still struggle with identifying micro-level artifacts, exhibit low accuracy in localizing tampered text regions, and heavily rely on expensive annotations for forgery interpretation. To this end, we introduce TextShield-R1, the first reinforcement learning based MLLM solution for tampered text detection and reasoning. Specifically, our approach introduces Forensic Continual Pre-training, an easy-to-hard curriculum that well prepares the MLLM for tampered text detection by harnessing the large-scale cheap data from natural image forensic and OCR tasks. During fine-tuning, we perform Group Relative Policy Optimization with novel reward functions to reduce annotation dependency and improve reasoning capabilities. At inference time, we enhance localization accuracy via OCR Rectification, a method that leverages the MLLM's strong text recognition abilities to refine its predictions. Furthermore, to support rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Text Forensics Reasoning (TFR) benchmark, comprising over 45k real and tampered images across 16 languages, 10 tampering techniques, and diverse domains. Rich reasoning-style annotations are included, allowing for comprehensive assessment.

Multiple specialized EO foundation models (EOFMs) will likely coexist, making efficient knowledge transfer across modalities essential. Most existing EO pretraining relies on masked image modeling, which emphasizes local reconstruction but provides limited control over global semantic structure. To address this, we propose a dual-teacher contrastive distillation framework for multispectral imagery that aligns the student's pretraining objective with the contrastive self-distillation paradigm of modern optical vision foundation models (VFMs). Our approach combines a multispectral teacher with an optical VFM teacher, enabling coherent cross-modal representation learning. Experiments across diverse optical and multispectral benchmarks show that our model adapts to multispectral data without compromising performance on optical-only inputs, achieving state-of-the-art results in both settings, with an average improvement of 3.64 percentage points in semantic segmentation, 1.2 in change detection, and 1.31 in classification tasks. This demonstrates that contrastive distillation provides a principled and efficient approach to scalable representation learning across heterogeneous EO data sources.

Prior studies typically relies on [CLS] attention or text-vision cross-attention to identify and discard redundant visual tokens. Despite promising results, such solutions are prone to introduce positional bias and, more critically, are incompatible with efficient attention kernels such as FlashAttention, limiting their practical deployment for VLM acceleration. In this paper, we step away from attention dependencies and revisit visual token compression from an information-theoretic perspective, aiming to maximally preserve visual information without any attention involvement. We present ApET, an Approximation-Error guided Token compression framework. ApET first reconstructs the original visual tokens with a small set of basis tokens via linear approximation, then leverages the approximation error to identify and drop the least informative tokens. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that ApET retains 95.2% of the original performance on image-understanding tasks and even attains 100.4% on video-understanding tasks, while compressing the token budgets by 88.9% and 87.5%, respectively. Thanks to its attention-free design, ApET seamlessly integrates with FlashAttention, enabling further inference acceleration and making VLM deployment more practical.

Giese"], "title": "BigMaQ: A Big Macaque Motion and Animation Dataset Bridging Image and 3D Pose Representations", "comment": null, "summary": "The recognition of dynamic and social behavior in animals is fundamental for advancing ethology, ecology, medicine and neuroscience. Recent progress in deep learning has enabled automated behavior recognition from video, yet an accurate reconstruction of the three-dimensional (3D) pose and shape has not been integrated into this process. Especially for non-human primates, mesh-based tracking efforts lag behind those for other species, leaving pose descriptions restricted to sparse keypoints that are unable to fully capture the richness of action dynamics. To address this gap, we introduce the $\\textbf{Big Ma}$ca$\\textbf{Q}$ue 3D Motion and Animation Dataset ($\\texttt{BigMaQ}$), a large-scale dataset comprising more than 750 scenes of interacting rhesus macaques with detailed 3D pose descriptions. Extending previous surface-based animal tracking methods, we construct subject-specific textured avatars by adapting a high-quality macaque template mesh to individual monkeys. This allows us to provide pose descriptions that are more accurate than previous state-of-the-art surface-based animal tracking methods. From the original dataset, we derive BigMaQ500, an action recognition benchmark that links surface-based pose vectors to single frames across multiple individual monkeys. By pairing features extracted from established image and video encoders with and without our pose descriptors, we demonstrate substantial improvements in mean average precision (mAP) when pose information is included. With these contributions, $\\texttt{BigMaQ}$ establishes the first dataset that both integrates dynamic 3D pose-shape representations into the learning task of animal action recognition and provides a rich resource to advance the study of visual appearance, posture, and social interaction in non-human primates.

Most recent approaches rely either on frozen foundation models in a training-free manner or on training with synthetic changes generated in pixel space. Both strategies inherently rely on predefined assumptions about change types, typically introduced through handcrafted rules, external datasets, or auxiliary generative models. Due to these assumptions, such methods fail to generalise beyond a few change types, limiting their real-world usage, especially in rare or complex scenarios. To address this, we propose MaSoN (Make Some Noise), an end-to-end UCD framework that synthesises diverse changes directly in the latent feature space during training. It generates changes that are dynamically estimated using feature statistics of target data, enabling diverse yet data-driven variation aligned with the target domain. It also easily extends to new modalities, such as SAR. MaSoN generalises strongly across diverse change types and achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks, improving the average F1 score by 14.1 percentage points.

Existing intermediate signals for portrait generation, such as 2D landmarks and parametric models, have limited disentanglement capabilities and cannot express personalized details due to their sparse or low-rank representation. Therefore, existing methods based on these models struggle to accurately preserve subject identity and expressions, hindering the generation of highly expressive portrait videos. To overcome these limitations, we propose a high-fidelity personalized head representation that more effectively disentangles expression and identity. This representation captures both static, subject-specific global geometry and dynamic, expression-related details. Furthermore, we introduce an expression transfer module to achieve personalized transfer of head pose and expression details between different identities. We use this sophisticated and highly expressive head model as a conditional signal to train a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based generator to synthesize richly detailed portrait videos.

Our method begins with 2D Gaussian initialization and then adaptively inserts and optimizes enhanced Gaussian kernels, ultimately producing an augmented radiance field. Experiments demonstrate that our method not only surpasses state-of-the-art NeRF methods in rendering performance but also achieves greater parameter efficiency.

But do they perform well as synthetic vision data generators? In this work, we revisit the promise of synthetic data as a scalable substitute for real training sets and uncover a surprising performance regression. We generate large-scale synthetic datasets using state-of-the-art T2I models released between 2022 and 2025, train standard classifiers solely on this synthetic data, and evaluate them on real test data. Despite observable advances in visual fidelity and prompt adherence, classification accuracy on real test data consistently declines with newer T2I models as training data generators. Our analysis reveals a hidden trend: These models collapse to a narrow, aesthetic-centric distribution that undermines diversity and label-image alignment. Overall, our findings challenge a growing assumption in vision research, namely that progress in generative realism implies progress in data realism.

Our architecture comprises four primary components: Diffuser, Checker, Actor, and Inverse Diffuser, following a Generate-Reflect-Edit paradigm to spark the Chain of Thought reasoning ability in image generation for addressing the dilemma. To equip the model with better intuition over generation trajectories, we further develop Reflection-GRPO to train the VLM Actor for edit prompts and the Image Editor for better image quality under a given prompt, respectively. Unlike traditional approaches that solely produce visually stunning yet structurally unreasonable content, our evaluation metrics prioritize spatial accuracy, utilizing Scene Graph IoU and employing a VLM-as-a-Judge strategy to assess the spatial consistency of generated images on LAION-SG dataset.

While optical sensors such as Camera and Lidar struggle in adverse weather conditions, Radar provides a more robust perception performance, effectively penetrating fog, rain, and snow. Since full Radar tensors have large data sizes and very few datasets provide them, most Radar-based approaches work with sparse point clouds or 2D projections, which can result in information loss. Additionally, deep learning methods show potential to extract richer and more dense features from low level Radar data and therefore significantly increase the perception performance. Therefore, we propose a 3D projection method for fast-Fourier-transformed 4D Range-Azimuth-Doppler-Elevation (RADE) tensors. Our method preserves rich Doppler and Elevation features while reducing the required data size for a single frame by 91.9% compared to a full tensor, thus achieving higher training and inference speed as well as lower model complexity. We introduce RADE-Net, a lightweight model tailored to 3D projections of the RADE tensor. The backbone enables exploitation of low-level and high-level cues of Radar tensors with spatial and channel-attention. The decoupled detection heads predict object center-points directly in the Range-Azimuth domain and regress rotated 3D bounding boxes from rich feature maps in the cartesian scene. We evaluate the model on scenes with multiple different road users and under various weather conditions on the large-scale K-Radar dataset and achieve a 16.7% improvement compared to their baseline, as well as 6.5% improvement over current Radar-only models. Additionally, we outperform several Lidar approaches in scenarios with adverse weather conditions.

This phenomenon, known as the modality gap, has been partially mitigated for standard text and image pairs but remains unknown and unresolved in more complex multimodal settings, such as the medical domain.

Previous studies have attempted to promote structural consistency through manually designed priors or rule-based constraints; however, these approaches typically require manual specification and are often non-differentiable, limiting their use as end-to-end training objectives. We propose SEAL-pose, a data-driven framework in which a learnable loss-net trains a pose-net by evaluating structural plausibility. Rather than relying on hand-crafted priors, our joint-graph-based design enables the loss-net to learn complex structural dependencies directly from data. Extensive experiments on three 3D HPE benchmarks with eight backbones show that SEAL-pose reduces per-joint errors and improves pose plausibility compared with the corresponding backbones across all settings. Beyond improving each backbone, SEAL-pose also outperforms models with explicit structural constraints, despite not enforcing any such constraints. Finally, we analyze the relationship between the loss-net and structural consistency, and evaluate SEAL-pose in cross-dataset and in-the-wild settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Conventional countermeasures, which jointly optimize the encoder and decoder via a noise layer, face 2 inevitable challenges: (1) decrease of clean accuracy due to decoder adversarial training and (2) limited robustness due to simultaneous training of all three advanced attacks. To overcome these issues, we propose AdvMark, a novel two-stage fine-tuning framework that decouples the defense strategies. In stage 1, we address adversarial vulnerability via a tailored adversarial training paradigm that primarily fine-tunes the encoder while only conditionally updating the decoder. This approach learns to move the image into a non-attackable region, rather than modifying the decision boundary, thus preserving clean accuracy. In stage 2, we tackle distortion and regeneration attacks via direct image optimization. To preserve the adversarial robustness gained in stage 1, we formulate a principled, constrained image loss with theoretical guarantees, which balances the deviation from cover and previous encoded images. We also propose a quality-aware early-stop to further guarantee the lower bound of visual quality.

Recent studies demonstrate that anchor-guided generative models are effective in modeling the uncertainty of driving behaviors and improving overall performance. However, these methods rely on discrete anchor vocabularies that must sufficiently cover the trajectory distribution during testing to ensure robustness, inducing an inherent trade-off between vocabulary size and model performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose MeanFuser, an end-to-end autonomous driving method that enhances both efficiency and robustness through three key designs. (1) We introduce Gaussian Mixture Noise (GMN) to guide generative sampling, enabling a continuous representation of the trajectory space and eliminating the dependency on discrete anchor vocabularies. (2) We adapt ``MeanFlow Identity\" to end-to-end planning, which models the mean velocity field between GMN and trajectory distribution instead of the instantaneous velocity field used in vanilla flow matching methods, effectively eliminating numerical errors from ODE solvers and significantly accelerating inference.

We speculate that this degradation is due to current models failing to fully understand their conditioning or intermediate generated scene content. Here, we propose to integrate pre-trained semantic feature extractors to incorporate stronger scene semantics as conditioning to achieve high-quality generation even at distant viewpoints.

While prior work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can generate charts or flag misleading figures, it remains unclear whether they and their vision-language counterparts (VLMs) can reason about and enforce visualization principles directly. Constraint based systems encode these principles as logical rules for precise automated checks, but translating them into formal specifications demands expert knowledge. This motivates leveraging LLMs and VLMs as principle checkers that can reason about visual design directly, bypassing the need for symbolic rule specification. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of both LLMs and VLMs on their ability to reason about visualization principles, using hard verification ground truth derived from Answer Set Programming (ASP). We compiled a set of visualization principles expressed as natural-language statements and generated a controlled dataset of approximately 2,000 Vega-Lite specifications annotated with explicit principle violations, complemented by over 300 real-world Vega-Lite charts. We evaluated both checking and fixing tasks, assessing how well models detect principle violations and correct flawed chart specifications. Our work highlights both the promise of large (vision-)language models as flexible validators and editors of visualization designs and the persistent gap with symbolic solvers on more nuanced aspects of visual perception. They also reveal an interesting asymmetry: frontier models tend to be more effective at correcting violations than at detecting them reliably.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86LLMs\u548cVLMs\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u539f\u5219\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u7ea0\u6b63\u8fdd\u89c4\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fdd\u89c4\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528LLMs\u548cVLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u539f\u5219\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5bf9\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5219\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u9700\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528ASP\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u53e5\u4e2d\u7f16\u8bd1\u89c6\u89c9\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u7ea62000\u4e2a\u5e26\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u539f\u5219\u8fdd\u89c4\u7684Vega-Lite\u89c4\u8303\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8d85\u8fc7300\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684Vega-Lite\u56fe\u8868\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u539f\u5219\u8fdd\u89c4\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u548cVLMs\u5728\u7ea0\u6b63\u8fdd\u89c4\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b83\u4eec\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u578b\uff08\u89c6\u89c9\uff09\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5fae\u5999\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

In parallel, research into transformer architectures for computer vision tasks has been highly successful: Increasingly, Vision Transformers (VTs) emerge as strong alternatives to CNNs. Yet, MU research for vision tasks has largely centered on CNNs, not VTs. While benchmarking MU efforts have addressed LLMs, diffusion models, and CNNs, none exist for VTs. This work is the first to attempt this, benchmarking MU algorithm performance in different VT families (ViT and Swin-T) and at different capacities. The work employs (i) different datasets, selected to assess the impacts of dataset scale and complexity; (ii) different MU algorithms, selected to represent fundamentally different approaches for MU; and (iii) both single-shot and continual unlearning protocols. Additionally, it focuses on benchmarking MU algorithms that leverage training data memorization, since leveraging memorization has been recently discovered to significantly improve the performance of previously SOTA algorithms. En route, the work characterizes how VTs memorize training data relative to CNNs, and assesses the impact of different memorization proxies on performance. The benchmark uses unified evaluation metrics that capture two complementary notions of forget quality along with accuracy on unseen (test) data and on retained data. Overall, this work offers a benchmarking basis, enabling reproducible, fair, and comprehensive comparisons of existing (and future) MU algorithms on VTs.

While prior work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can generate charts or flag misleading figures, it remains unclear whether they can reason about and enforce visualization rules directly. Constraint-based systems such as Draco encode these rules as logical constraints for precise automated checks, but maintaining symbolic encodings requires expert effort, motivating the use of LLMs as flexible rule validators. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of LLMs against visualization rules using hard-verification ground truth derived from Answer Set Programming (ASP). We translated a subset of Draco's constraints into natural-language statements and generated a controlled dataset of 2,000 Vega-Lite specifications annotated with explicit rule violations. LLMs were evaluated on both accuracy in detecting violations and prompt adherence, which measures whether outputs follow the required structured format. Results show that frontier models achieve high adherence (Gemma 3 4B / 27B: 100%, GPT-oss 20B: 98%) and reliably detect common violations (F1 up to 0.82),yet performance drops for subtler perceptual rules (F1 < 0.15 for some categories) and for outputs generated from technical ASP formulations.Translating constraints into natural language improved performance by up to 150% for smaller models.

We present Flow3r, a framework that augments visual geometry learning with dense 2D correspondences (`flow') as supervision, enabling scalable training from unlabeled monocular videos. Our key insight is that the flow prediction module should be factored: predicting flow between two images using geometry latents from one and pose latents from the other. This factorization directly guides the learning of both scene geometry and camera motion, and naturally extends to dynamic scenes. In controlled experiments, we show that factored flow prediction outperforms alternative designs and that performance scales consistently with unlabeled data. Integrating factored flow into existing visual geometry architectures and training with ${\\sim}800$K unlabeled videos, Flow3r achieves state-of-the-art results across eight benchmarks spanning static and dynamic scenes, with its largest gains on in-the-wild dynamic videos where labeled data is most scarce.", "AI": {"tldr": "Flow3r\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u76843D/4D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d3D/4D\u91cd\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u5bc6\u96c6\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u76d1\u7763\u5728\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c24\u5176\u7a00\u7f3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFlow3r\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u51e0\u4f55\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bc6\u96c62D\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff08`flow'\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u5173\u952e\u6d1e\u5bdf\u662f\u5c06\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u5206\u89e3\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u6765\u81ea\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u4e24\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6d41\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5206\u89e3\u76f4\u63a5\u6307\u5bfc\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u7136\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5206\u89e3\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u4f18\u4e8e\u66ff\u4ee3\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u5c06\u5206\u89e3\u6d41\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u51e0\u4f55\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528${\\sim}800$K\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0cFlow3r\u5728\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u516b\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u91ce\u5916\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5927\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u6700\u7a00\u7f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "Flow3r\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Video reasoning grounds intelligence in spatiotemporally consistent visual environments that go beyond what text can naturally capture, enabling intuitive reasoning over spatiotemporal structure such as continuity, interaction, and causality. However, systematically studying video reasoning and its scaling behavior is hindered by the lack of large-scale training data. To address this gap, we introduce the Very Big Video Reasoning (VBVR) Dataset, an unprecedentedly large-scale resource spanning 200 curated reasoning tasks following a principled taxonomy and over one million video clips, approximately three orders of magnitude larger than existing datasets. We further present VBVR-Bench, a verifiable evaluation framework that moves beyond model-based judging by incorporating rule-based, human-aligned scorers, enabling reproducible and interpretable diagnosis of video reasoning capabilities. Leveraging the VBVR suite, we conduct one of the first large-scale scaling studies of video reasoning and observe early signs of emergent generalization to unseen reasoning tasks. Together, VBVR lays a foundation for the next stage of research in generalizable video reasoning.

Our framework efficiently compresses multiple image observations into the fast weights of the TTT layer, forming an implicit 3D representation in the latent space that can be decoded into various explicit formats, such as Gaussian Splats (GS) for downstream applications. The online learning variant of our model supports progressive 3D reconstruction and refinement from streaming observations. We demonstrate that pretraining on novel view synthesis tasks effectively transfers to explicit 3D modeling, resulting in improved reconstruction quality and faster convergence. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in feedforward 3D Gaussian reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art approaches on both objects and scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "tttLRM\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u51fatttLRM\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u81ea\u56de\u5f523D\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u59273D\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ed3\u679c\u538b\u7f29\u5230TTT\u5c42\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6743\u91cd\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f62\u6210\u9690\u5f0f3D\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u7801\u6210\u5404\u79cd\u663e\u5f0f\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5982\u9ad8\u65afSplats\uff08GS\uff09\u3002\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u6d41\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f3D\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u7ec6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u573a\u666f\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6b63\u54113D\u9ad8\u65af\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "tttLRM\u6a21\u578b\u57283D\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Existing models, however, remain data-hungry and too heavy for deployment on edge devices. We present Mobile-O, a compact vision-language-diffusion model that brings unified multimodal intelligence to a mobile device. Its core module, the Mobile Conditioning Projector (MCP), fuses vision-language features with a diffusion generator using depthwise-separable convolutions and layerwise alignment. This design enables efficient cross-modal conditioning with minimal computational cost. Trained on only a few million samples and post-trained in a novel quadruplet format (generation prompt, image, question, answer), Mobile-O jointly enhances both visual understanding and generation capabilities. Despite its efficiency, Mobile-O attains competitive or superior performance compared to other unified models, achieving 74% on GenEval and outperforming Show-O and JanusFlow by 5% and 11%, while running 6x and 11x faster, respectively. For visual understanding, Mobile-O surpasses them by 15.3% and 5.1% averaged across seven benchmarks. Running in only ~3s per 512x512 image on an iPhone, Mobile-O establishes the first practical framework for real-time unified multimodal understanding and generation on edge devices. We hope Mobile-O will ease future research in real-time unified multimodal intelligence running entirely on-device with no cloud dependency.
