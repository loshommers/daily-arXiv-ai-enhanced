This weakness stems from a reliance on finite training datasets, which are prohibitively expensive to scale and impose a ceiling on model robustness.

Building on this, we propose \\textbf{AOT (Adversarial Opponent Training)}, a self-play framework that forges MLLM robustness by creating its own training data.

We translated findings into a hybrid risk screening system integrating symptom relevance and temporal proximity, evaluated across 3-90 day windows through EHR-based simulations. Under conservative thresholds, intentionally designed to minimize false alerts, the screening system achieved high specificity (1.00) and prevalence-adjusted positive predictive value (1.00), with good sensitivity (0.72), an expected trade-off prioritizing precision, that was highest in 90-day window.

However, most existing AI approaches are optimized for a single domain (molecules or materials) and a single task (generation or prediction), which limits representation sharing and transfer. We introduce Zatom-1, the first foundation model that unifies generative and predictive learning of 3D molecules and materials. Zatom-1 is a Transformer trained with a multimodal flow matching objective that jointly models discrete atom types and continuous 3D geometries. This approach supports scalable pretraining with predictable gains as model capacity increases, while enabling fast and stable sampling. We use joint generative pretraining as a universal initialization for downstream multi-task prediction of properties, energies, and forces. Empirically, Zatom-1 matches or outperforms specialized baselines on both generative and predictive benchmarks, while reducing the generative inference time by more than an order of magnitude. Our experiments demonstrate positive predictive transfer between chemical domains from joint generative pretraining: modeling materials during pretraining improves molecular property prediction accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Conformal prediction provides distribution-free marginal coverage, yet split conformal uses a single global residual quantile and can be poorly adaptive under heteroscedasticity. Methods that improve adaptivity typically fit auxiliary nuisance models or introduce additional data splits/partitions to learn the conformal score, increasing cost and reducing data efficiency. We propose LoBoost, a model-native local conformal method that reuses the fitted ensemble's leaf structure to define multiscale calibration groups. Each input is encoded by its sequence of visited leaves; at resolution level k, we group points by matching prefixes of leaf indices across the first k trees and calibrate residual quantiles within each group.

Submitted to [RAAI]", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential in the field of scientific idea generation. However, the generated results often lack controllable academic context and traceable inspiration pathways. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a scientific idea generation system called GYWI, which combines author knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to form an external knowledge base to provide controllable context and trace of inspiration path for LLMs to generate new scientific ideas. We first propose an author-centered knowledge graph construction method and inspiration source sampling algorithms to construct external knowledge base. Then, we propose a hybrid retrieval mechanism that is composed of both RAG and GraphRAG to retrieve content with both depth and breadth knowledge. It forms a hybrid context. Thirdly, we propose a Prompt optimization strategy incorporating reinforcement learning principles to automatically guide LLMs optimizing the results based on the hybrid context. To evaluate the proposed approaches, we constructed an evaluation dataset based on arXiv (2018-2023). This paper also develops a comprehensive evaluation method including empirical automatic assessment in multiple-choice question task, LLM-based scoring, human evaluation, and semantic space visualization analysis.

Flow-based methods often exhibit greater training stability and have achieved strong empirical performance in high-dimensional settings where data concentrate near a low-dimensional manifold, such as text-to-image synthesis, video generation, and molecular structure generation. Despite this success, existing theoretical analyses of flow matching assume target distributions with smooth, full-dimensional densities, leaving its effectiveness in manifold-supported settings largely unexplained. To this end, we theoretically analyze flow matching with linear interpolation when the target distribution is supported on a smooth manifold. We establish a non-asymptotic convergence guarantee for the learned velocity field, and then propagate this estimation error through the ODE to obtain statistical consistency of the implicit density estimator induced by the flow-matching objective. The resulting convergence rate is near minimax-optimal, depends only on the intrinsic dimension, and reflects the smoothness of both the manifold and the target distribution.

It foregrounds prompt-sensitivity analysis as a methodological issue by varying prompt scaffolding and framing in a balanced 2x3 design. Using footnote 6 in Chubin and Moitra (1975) and Gilbert's (1977) reconstruction as a probe, I implement a two-stage GPT-5 pipeline: a citation-text-only surface classification and expectation pass, followed by cross-document interpretative reconstruction using the citing and cited full texts. Across 90 reconstructions, the model produces 450 distinct hypotheses. Close reading and inductive coding identify 21 recurring interpretative moves, and linear probability models estimate how prompt choices shift their frequencies and lexical repertoire. GPT-5's surface pass is highly stable, consistently classifying the citation as \"supplementary\". In reconstruction, the model generates a structured space of plausible alternatives, but scaffolding and examples redistribute attention and vocabulary, sometimes toward strained readings. Relative to Gilbert, GPT-5 detects the same textual hinges yet more often resolves them as lineage and positioning than as admonishment. The study outlines opportunities and risks of using LLMs as guided co-analysts for inspectable, contestable interpretative CCA, and it shows that prompt scaffolding and framing systematically tilt which plausible readings and vocabularies the model foregrounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Unlike standard recurrent architectures that rely on gating mechanisms to suppress competing hypotheses, our framework utilizes quantum interference: the Hamiltonian steers the phases of complex amplitudes so that conflicting interpretations cancel while compatible ones reinforce. The dynamics are strictly unitary, ensuring that the state norm is preserved exactly at every time step via a Cayley (Crank--Nicolson) discretization. Token probabilities are extracted using the Born rule, a quadratic measurement operator that couples magnitudes and relative phases. Our primary theoretical contribution is a separation theorem characterizing the representational advantage of this readout: we define a family of disambiguation tasks that a complex unitary model of dimension $N$ solves exactly, but which requires a state dimension of $\u03a9(N^2)$ for any real-valued orthogonal model equipped with a standard affine-softmax readout. This quadratic gap arises because the Born rule implicitly lifts the $N$-dimensional state into the space of rank-one Hermitian matrices, accessing pairwise phase correlations that are inaccessible to linear projections. Finally, we derive a continuity equation for the latent probability mass, yielding conserved pairwise currents that serve as a built-in diagnostic for tracing information flow between dimensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Introduce a quantum-inspired sequence modeling framework with potential advantages over standard recurrent architectures.", "motivation": "Introduce a sequence modeling framework with a complex-valued wave function and a learned, time-dependent Hamiltonian.", "method": "Utilize quantum interference to steer the phases of complex amplitudes, and extract token probabilities using the Born rule.", "result": "Propose a separation theorem characterizing the representational advantage of the framework, and derive a continuity equation for the latent probability mass.", "conclusion": "The proposed framework offers a novel approach for sequence modeling with potential advantages over standard recurrent architectures."}}

This paper precisely characterizes the operational conditions under which full or partial re-hashing becomes unavoidable. The paper also analyzes the downstream impact of cryptographic re-hashing on Recovery Time Objective (RTO) compliance, and proposes a generalized architectural shift toward deterministic, metadata-driven identification.

While often humorous, memes can also be exploited to spread offensive, harmful, and inflammatory content targeting individuals and groups. Detecting this type of content is excep- tionally challenging due to its satirical, subtle, and culturally specific nature. This problem is magnified for low-resource lan- guages like Bengali, as existing research predominantly focuses on high-resource languages. To address this critical research gap, we introduce Bn-HIB (Bangla Hate Inflammatory Benign), a novel dataset containing 3,247 manually annotated Bengali memes categorized as Benign, Hate, or Inflammatory. Significantly, Bn- HIB is the first dataset to distinguish inflammatory content from direct hate speech in Bengali memes. Furthermore, we propose the MCFM (Multi-Modal Co-Attention Fusion Model), a simple yet effective architecture that mutually analyzes both the visual and textual elements of a meme. MCFM employs a co-attention mechanism to identify and fuse the most critical features from each modality, leading to a more accurate classification. Our experiments show that MCFM significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art models on the Bn-HIB dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in this nuanced task.Warning: This work contains material that may be disturbing to some audience members.

However, existing approaches remain limited under aerial conditions with single-view capture, wide spatial range, and dynamic objects of limited spatial footprint and large motion disparity. These challenges cause severe depth ambiguity and unstable motion estimation, making monocular aerial reconstruction inherently ill-posed. To this end, we present AeroDGS, a physics-guided 4D Gaussian splatting framework for monocular UAV videos. AeroDGS introduces a Monocular Geometry Lifting module that reconstructs reliable static and dynamic geometry from a single aerial sequence, providing a robust basis for dynamic estimation. To further resolve monocular ambiguity, we propose a Physics-Guided Optimization module that incorporates differentiable ground-support, upright-stability, and trajectory-smoothness priors, transforming ambiguous image cues into physically consistent motion.

However, existing imaging modalities lack the necessary accuracy to reliably predict malignancy before surgical intervention. While deep learning has shown promise in malignancy prediction using 3D CT images, traditional approaches often rely on manual segmentation to isolate the tumor region and reduce noise, which enhances predictive performance. Manual segmentation, however, is labor-intensive, costly, and dependent on expert knowledge. In this study, a deep learning framework was developed utilizing an Organ Focused Attention (OFA) loss function to modify the attention of image patches so that organ patches attend only to other organ patches. Hence, no segmentation of 3D renal CT images is required at deployment time for malignancy prediction. The proposed framework achieved an AUC of 0.685 and an F1-score of 0.872 on a private dataset from the UF Integrated Data Repository (IDR), and an AUC of 0.760 and an F1-score of 0.852 on the publicly available KiTS21 dataset. These results surpass the performance of conventional models that rely on segmentation-based cropping for noise reduction, demonstrating the frameworks ability to enhance predictive accuracy without explicit segmentation input.

This work evaluates prompt-injection and jailbreak vulnerability using a large, manually curated dataset across multiple open-source LLMs, including Phi, Mistral, DeepSeek-R1, Llama 3.2, Qwen, and Gemma variants.

We identify Concept Vectors (CVs), which carry more stable concept representations. Like FVs, CVs are composed of attention head outputs; however, unlike FVs, the constituent heads are selected using Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) based on whether they encode concepts consistently across input formats. While these heads emerge in similar layers to FV-related heads, the two sets are largely distinct, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. Steering experiments reveal that FVs excel in-distribution, when extraction and application formats match (e.g., both open-ended in English), while CVs generalize better out-of-distribution across both question types (open-ended vs. multiple-choice) and languages.

Through systematic analysis of artifacts in ViTs, we find that their fundamental mechanisms have yet to be sufficiently elucidated. In this paper, through systematic analysis, we conclude that these artifacts originate from a lazy aggregation behavior: ViT uses semantically irrelevant background patches as shortcuts to represent global semantics, driven by global attention and Coarse-grained semantic supervision. Our solution selectively integrates patch features into the CLS token, reducing the influence of background-dominated shortcuts and consistently improving performance across 12 benchmarks under label-, text-, and self-supervision.

A key limitation in current AI deployments is the reliance on a one-size-fits-all inference strategy where most systems route every request to the same large model, regardless of task complexity, leading to substantial and unnecessary energy waste. To address this issue, we propose a context-aware model switching approach that dynamically selects an appropriate language model based on query complexity. The proposed system uses a Context-Aware Model Switching for Energy-Efficient LLM Inference that combines caching for repeated queries, rulebased complexity scoring for fast and explainable decisions, machine learning classification to capture semantic intent, and a user-adaptive component that learns from interaction patterns over time. The proposed architecture was evaluated using real conversation workloads and three open-source language models (Gemma3 1B, Gemma3 4B and Qwen3 4B) with different computational costs, measuring energy consumption (via NVML GPU power telemetry), response latency, routing accuracy, and output quality (BERTScore F1) to reflect real-world usage conditions. Experimental results show that the model switching approach can reduce energy consumption by up to 67.5% compared to always using the largest model while maintaining a response quality of 93.6%. In addition, the response time for simple queries also improved significantly by approximately 68%. These results show that model switching inference offers a practical and scalable path toward more energy-efficient and sustainable AI systems, demonstrating that significant efficiency gains can be achieved without major sacrifices in response quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524dAI\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7f13\u5b58\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e67.5%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u630193.6%\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7b80\u5355\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\u63a8\u7406\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u53ef\u884c\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

The proposed measure extends integrated $R^2$ from scalar responses to responses taking values on general spaces equipped with a characteristic kernel, allowing to measure dependence of multivariate, functional, and structured data, while remaining sensitive to tail behaviour and oscillatory dependence structures. We establish that (i) this new measure takes values in $[0,1]$, (ii) equals zero if and only if independence holds, and (iii) equals one if and only if the response is almost surely a measurable function of the covariates.

They are widely used in zero-shot classification, multi-modal retrieval, text-to-image diffusion, and as image encoders in large vision-language models. However, CLIP's pretraining is dominated by images paired with short captions, biasing the model toward encoding simple descriptions of salient objects and leading to coarse alignment on complex scenes and dense descriptions. While recent work mitigates this by fine-tuning on small-scale long-caption datasets, we identify an important common bias: both human- and LLM-generated long captions typically begin with a one-sentence summary followed by a detailed description. We show that this acts as a shortcut during training, concentrating attention on the opening sentence and early tokens and weakening alignment over the rest of the caption. To resolve this, we introduce DeBias-CLIP, which removes the summary sentence during training and applies sentence sub-sampling and text token padding to distribute supervision across all token positions.

Yet their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains largely unexplored. In this work, we show that well-established data-poisoning pipelines can successfully implant backdoors into MDLMs, enabling attackers to manipulate model behavior via specific triggers while maintaining normal performance on clean inputs. However, defense strategies effective to these models are yet to emerge. To bridge this gap, we introduce a backdoor defense framework for MDLMs named DiSP (Diffusion Self-Purification). DiSP is driven by a key observation: selectively masking certain vision tokens at inference time can neutralize a backdoored model's trigger-induced behaviors and restore normal functionality. Building on this, we purify the poisoned dataset using the compromised model itself, then fine-tune the model on the purified data to recover it to a clean one. Given such a specific design, DiSP can remove backdoors without requiring any auxiliary models or clean reference data.

To investigate the cognitive strategies underlying this ability, we introduce the Cognitive Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (CogARC), a diverse human-adapted subset of the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) which was originally developed to benchmark abstract reasoning in artificial intelligence. Across two experiments, CogARC was administered to a total of 260 human participants who freely generated solutions to 75 abstract visual reasoning problems. Success required inferring input-output rules from a small number of examples to transform the test input into one correct test output. Participants' behavior was recorded at high temporal resolution, including example viewing, edit sequences, and multi-attempt submissions. Participants were generally successful (mean accuracy ~90% for experiment 1 (n=40), ~80% for experiment 2 (n=220) across problems), but performance varied widely across problems and participants. Harder problems elicited longer deliberation times and greater divergence in solution strategies. Over the course of the task, participants initiated responses more quickly but showed a slight decline in accuracy, suggesting increased familiarity with the task structure rather than improved rule-learning ability. Importantly, even incorrect solutions were often highly convergent, even when the problem-solving trajectories differed in length and smoothness. Some trajectories progressed directly and efficiently toward a stable outcome, whereas others involved extended exploration or partial restarts before converging.

In this work, we diagnose this issue by introducing the Visualized-Question (VQ) setting, where text queries are rendered directly onto images to structurally mandate visual engagement. Our diagnostic experiments on Qwen2.5-VL reveal a startling capability-utilization gap: despite possessing strong OCR capabilities, models suffer a performance degradation of up to 12.7% in the VQ setting, exposing a deep-seated ``modality laziness.'' To bridge this gap, we propose SimpleOCR, a plug-and-play training strategy that imposes a structural constraint on the learning process. By transforming training samples into the VQ format with randomized styles, SimpleOCR effectively invalidates text-based shortcuts, compelling the model to activate and optimize its visual text extraction pathways. Empirically, SimpleOCR yields robust gains without architectural modifications. On four representative OOD benchmarks, it surpasses the base model by 5.4% and GRPO based on original images by 2.7%, while exhibiting extreme data efficiency, achieving superior performance with 30x fewer samples (8.5K) than recent RL-based methods. Furthermore, its plug-and-play nature allows seamless integration with advanced RL strategies like NoisyRollout to yield complementary improvements.

Existing methods use a calibrated scalar evaluator for the target objective to guide search, but for many tasks such scores are unavailable, too sparse, or unreliable. Pairwise comparisons, by contrast, are often easier to elicit, still provide useful signal on improvement directions, and can be obtained from the LLM itself without external supervision. Building on this observation, we introduce Duel-Evolve, an evolutionary optimization algorithm that replaces external scalar rewards with pairwise preferences elicited from the same LLM used to generate candidates. Duel-Evolve aggregates these noisy candidate comparisons via a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model, yielding uncertainty-aware estimates of candidate quality. These quality estimates guide allocation of the comparison budget toward plausible optima using Double Thompson Sampling, as well as selection of high-quality parents to generate improved candidates. We evaluate Duel-Evolve on MathBench, where it achieves 20 percentage points higher accuracy over existing methods and baselines, and on LiveCodeBench, where it improves over comparable iterative methods by over 12 percentage points. Notably, the method requires no reward model, no ground-truth labels during search, and no hand-crafted scoring function.

The hybrid dataset contains human-written messages together with LLM-generated paraphrases that use masking techniques and personalization methods to enhance modern attack resistance. The evaluation system uses five testing protocols which include human-only and LLM-only tests and two cross-distribution transfer tests and a production-like mixed traffic test to assess performance in native environments and across different distribution types and combined traffic scenarios. The distilled model maintains a weighted-F1 score difference of 1-2.5 points compared to the mixture split results of strong transformer baselines including ModernBERT, DeBERTaV3-base, T5-base, DeepSeek-R1 Distill Qwen-1.5B and Phi-4 mini while achieving 80-95\\% faster inference times and 95-99\\% smaller model sizes.

The rise of advanced tools for the simulation of physical systems in addition to data-driven machine learning models offers the possibility to design numerical tools dedicated to efficient system monitoring. In that respect, the digital twin concept presents an adequate framework that proffers solution to these challenges. The main purpose of this paper is to develop such a digital twin dedicated to fault detection and diagnosis in the context of a thermal-hydraulic process supervision. Based on a numerical simulation of the system, in addition to machine learning methods, we propose different modules dedicated to process parameter change detection and their on-line estimation.

This transformation yields a well-conditioned second-moment matrix, enabling its inversion with a significantly strengthened ability to resist the DP noise. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of PMT by using penalized and generalized linear regressions.

When we examine this topic, what matters is not only the model itself but also the personas we simulate on that model.

Newer models are therefore able to simulate it.

Recently, agentic generative AI systems have demonstrated significant advances in algorithm design, improving code efficiency, and enabling discovery across scientific domains.\n  Bridging these worlds, we present ArchAgent, an automated computer architecture discovery system built on AlphaEvolve. We show ArchAgent's ability to automatically design/implement state-of-the-art (SoTA) cache replacement policies (architecting new mechanisms/logic, not only changing parameters), broadly within the confines of an established cache replacement policy design competition.\n  In two days without human intervention, ArchAgent generated a policy achieving a 5.3% IPC speedup improvement over the prior SoTA on public multi-core Google Workload Traces. On the heavily-explored single-core SPEC06 workloads, it generated a policy in just 18 days showing a 0.9% IPC speedup improvement over the existing SoTA (a similar \"winning margin\" as reported by the existing SoTA). ArchAgent achieved these gains 3-5x faster than prior human-developed SoTA policies.\n  Agentic flows also enable \"post-silicon hyperspecialization\" where agents tune runtime-configurable parameters exposed in hardware policies to further align the policies with a specific workload (mix). Exploiting this, we demonstrate a 2.4% IPC speedup improvement over prior SoTA on SPEC06 workloads.\n  Finally, we outline broader implications for computer architecture research in the era of agentic AI. For example, we demonstrate the phenomenon of \"simulator escapes\", where the agentic AI flow discovered and exploited a loophole in a popular microarchitectural simulator - a consequence of the fact that these research tools were designed for a (now past) world where they were exclusively operated by humans acting in good-faith.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, this sequential pipeline fails to leverage the intricate interaction between quantization bit-width and LoRA rank. Specifically, a carefully optimized quantization allocation with low quantization error does not always translate to strong fine-tuning performance, and different bit-width and rank configurations can lead to significantly varying outcomes under the same memory budget. To address this limitation, we propose AutoQRA, a joint optimization framework that simultaneously optimizes the bit-width and LoRA rank configuration for each layer during the mixed quantized fine-tuning process. To tackle the challenges posed by the large discrete search space and the high evaluation cost associated with frequent fine-tuning iterations, AutoQRA decomposes the optimization process into two stages. First, it first conducts a global multi-fidelity evolutionary search, where the initial population is warm-started by injecting layer-wise importance priors. This stage employs specific operators and a performance model to efficiently screen candidate configurations.

This paradigm enables reasoning beyond discrete language tokens by performing multi-step computation in continuous latent spaces. Although there have been numerous studies focusing on improving the performance of latent reasoning, its internal mechanisms remain not fully investigated. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of latent reasoning methods to better understand the role and behavior of latent representation in the process. We identify two key issues across latent reasoning methods with different levels of supervision. First, we observe pervasive shortcut behavior, where they achieve high accuracy without relying on latent reasoning. Second, we examine the hypothesis that latent reasoning supports BFS-like exploration in latent space, and find that while latent representations can encode multiple possibilities, the reasoning process does not faithfully implement structured search, but instead exhibits implicit pruning and compression. Finally, our findings reveal a trade-off associated with supervision strength: stronger supervision mitigates shortcut behavior but restricts the ability of latent representations to maintain diverse hypotheses, whereas weaker supervision allows richer latent representations at the cost of increased shortcut behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u76d1\u7763\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u76d1\u7763\u5f3a\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u800c\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5219\u4ee5\u589e\u52a0\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u652f\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5e76\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

We trace this failure to spatial credit collapse: activation credit concentrating on sparse visual patches in early transformer layers, which suppresses contextual evidence and increases reliance on language priors. We introduce Spatial Credit Redistribution (SCR), a training-free inference-time intervention that redistributes hidden-state activation from high-attention source patches to their context, guided by low-entropy inputs. We evaluate six model families (Chameleon, LLaVA, and Qwen, including both Qwen-VL and Qwen2-VL) at scales of 7B, 13B, and 30B, on POPE and CHAIR benchmarks. SCR reduces hallucination by ~4.7-6.0 percentage points on POPE-Adversarial, cuts CHAIR-s by 3.7-5.2 percentage points (42-51 percent relative), and CHAIR-i by 2.7-4.4 percentage points (44-58 percent relative), and preserves CIDEr within 0.8 percentage points. Gains are largest for low-entropy inputs, consistent with the theoretical framework.

However, shared local model updates remain vulnerable to inference and poisoning attacks. Secure aggregation schemes have been proposed to mitigate these attacks. In this work, we aim to understand how these techniques are implemented in quantum-assisted FL. Quantum Secure Aggregation (QSA) has been proposed, offering information-theoretic privacy by encoding client updates into the global phase of multipartite entangled states. Existing QSA protocols, however, rely on a single global Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state shared among all participating clients. This design poses fundamental challenges: fidelity of large-scale GHZ states deteriorates rapidly with the increasing number of clients; and (ii) the global aggregation prevents the detection of Byzantine clients. We propose Clustered Quantum Secure Aggregation (CQSA), a modular aggregation framework that reconciles the physical constraints of near-term quantum hardware along with the need for Byzantine-robustness in FL. CQSA randomly partitions the clients into small clusters, each performing local quantum aggregation using high-fidelity, low-qubit GHZ states. The server analyzes statistical relationships between cluster-level aggregates employing common statistical measures such as cosine similarity and Euclidean distance to identify malicious contributions. Through theoretical analysis and simulations under depolarizing noise, we demonstrate that CQSA ensures stable model convergence, achieves superior state fidelity over global QSA.", "AI": {"tldr": "CQSA\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u7fa4\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u8f85\u52a9\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u8f85\u52a9\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u6280\u672f", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCQSA\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u805a\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u968f\u673a\u5212\u5206\u6210\u5c0f\u96c6\u7fa4\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u96c6\u7fa4\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u4f4e\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7684GHZ\u72b6\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u91cf\u5b50\u805a\u5408\u3002\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u96c6\u7fa4\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u805a\u5408\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u6076\u610f\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "CQSA\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5168\u5c40QSA\u4e4b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "CQSA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u51b3\u91cf\u5b50\u8f85\u52a9\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Among existing samplers, the Euler method remains the standard choice in many applications, and more recently, the First-Hitting Sampler (FHS) has shown considerable promise for masked diffusion models. Despite their practical success, the theoretical understanding of these samplers remains limited. Existing analyses are conducted in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which often yields loose parameter dependencies and requires strong assumptions on score estimation. Moreover, these guarantees do not cover recently developed high-performance sampler of FHS. In this work, we first develop a direct total-variation (TV) based analysis for the Euler method that overcomes these limitations. Our results relax assumptions on score estimation, improve parameter dependencies, and establish convergence guarantees without requiring any surrogate initialization. Also for this setting, we provide the first convergence lower bound for the Euler sampler, establishing tightness with respect to both the data dimension $d$ and the target accuracy $\\varepsilon$. Finally, we analyze the FHS sampler and show that it incurs no sampling error beyond that induced by score estimation, which we show to be tight with a matching lower error bound. Overall, our analysis introduces a direct TV-based error decomposition along the CTMC trajectory and a decoupling-based path-wise analysis for FHS, which may be of independent interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Nevertheless, these systems encounter a significant security flaw: hubness - items that frequently appear in the top-k retrieval results for a disproportionately high number of varied queries. These hubs can be exploited to introduce harmful content, alter search rankings, bypass content filtering, and decrease system performance.\n  We introduce hubscan, an open-source security scanner that evaluates vector indices and embeddings to identify hubs in RAG systems. Hubscan presents a multi-detector architecture that integrates: (1) robust statistical hubness detection utilizing median/MAD-based z-scores, (2) cluster spread analysis to assess cross-cluster retrieval patterns, (3) stability testing under query perturbations, and (4) domain-aware and modality-aware detection for category-specific and cross-modal attacks. Our solution accommodates several vector databases (FAISS, Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate) and offers versatile retrieval techniques, including vector similarity, hybrid search, and lexical matching with reranking capabilities.\n  We evaluate hubscan on Food-101, MS-COCO, and FiQA adversarial hubness benchmarks constructed using state-of-the-art gradient-optimized and centroid-based hub generation methods. hubscan achieves 90% recall at a 0.2% alert budget and 100% recall at 0.4%, with adversarial hubs ranking above the 99.8th percentile.

Existing approaches use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train action scorers, but SFT treats each candidate independently and does not explicitly teach the model to discriminate between actions that are physically correct and those that are subtly wrong. We propose the Contrastive World Model (CWM), which fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) as an action scorer using an InfoNCE contrastive objective with hard-mined negative examples. The key idea is to push valid actions away from invalid ones in scoring space, with special emphasis on hard negatives: semantically similar but physically incompatible candidates. We evaluate CWM on the ScienceWorld benchmark through two studies. First, an intrinsic affordance evaluation on 605 hard-negative test pairs shows that CWM outperforms SFT by +6.76 percentage points on Precision@1 for minimal-edit negatives -- cases where a single word changes the physical outcome -- and achieves a higher AUC-ROC (0.929 vs. 0.906). Second, a live filter characterisation study measures how well CWM ranks gold-path actions against all valid environment actions during task execution. Under out-of-distribution stress conditions, CWM maintains a significantly better safety margin (-2.39) than SFT (-3.96), indicating that the gold action is ranked closer to the top. These results support the hypothesis that contrastive training induces representations that capture physical feasibility more faithfully than SFT alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We re-interpret causal self-attention transformers, the backbone of modern foundation models, within a probabilistic framework, much like how classical PCA is extended to probabilistic PCA. However, this re-formulation reveals a surprising and deeper structural insight: due to a change-of-variables phenomenon, a barrier constraint emerges on the self-attention parameters. This induces a highly structured geometry on the token space, providing theoretical insights into the dynamics of LLM decoding. This reveals a boundary where attention becomes ill-conditioned, leading to a margin interpretation similar to classical support vector machines. Just like support vectors, this naturally gives rise to the concept of support tokens.\n  Furthermore, we show that LLMs can be interpreted as a stochastic process over the power set of the token space, providing a rigorous probabilistic framework for sequence modeling. We propose a Bayesian framework and derive a MAP estimation objective that requires only a minimal modification to standard LLM training: the addition of a smooth log-barrier penalty to the usual cross-entropy loss.

Additionally, these methods suffer from insufficient details in both semantic and structural aspects. Specifically, brief and view-invariant captions restrict semantic contexts, resulting in weak background modeling. Meanwhile, the standard denoising loss with uniform spatial weighting neglects foreground structural details, causing visual distortions and blurriness. To address these challenges, we propose DrivePTS, which incorporates three key innovations. Firstly, our framework adopts a progressive learning strategy to mitigate inter-dependency between geometric conditions, reinforced by an explicit mutual information constraint. Secondly, a Vision-Language Model is utilized to generate multi-view hierarchical descriptions across six semantic aspects, providing fine-grained textual guidance. Thirdly, a frequency-guided structure loss is introduced to strengthen the model's sensitivity to high-frequency elements, improving foreground structural fidelity.

However, the large travel demand for broader geographical areas and longer time spans requires models to distinguish each node clearly and possess a holistic view of the history, which has been paid less attention to in prior works. Furthermore, increasing sizes of data hinder the deployment of most models in real application environments. To this end, in this paper, we propose a lightweight Positional-aware Spatio-Temporal Network (PASTN) to effectively capture both temporal and spatial complexities in an end-to-end manner.

In practice, such models are often fine-tuned to improve zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, allowing them to solve tasks without examples and thereby reducing inference costs. However, fine-tuning can degrade in-context learning, limiting the performance of fine-tuned models on tasks not seen during fine-tuning. Using linear attention models, we provide a theoretical analysis that characterizes how fine-tuning objectives modify attention parameters and identifies conditions under which this leads to degraded few-shot performance. We show that fine-tuning all attention parameters can harm in-context learning, whereas restricting updates to the value matrix improves zero-shot performance while preserving in-context learning. We further show that incorporating an auxiliary few-shot loss enhances in-context learning primarily on the target task, at the expense of degraded in-context learning ability on tasks not seen during fine-tuning.

We propose Search-P1, a framework that introduces path-centric reward shaping for agentic RAG training, comprising two key components: (1) Path-Centric Reward, which evaluates the structural quality of reasoning trajectories through order-agnostic step coverage and soft scoring that extracts learning signals even from failed samples, and (2) Dual-Track Path Scoring with offline-generated reference planners that assesses paths from both self-consistency and reference-alignment perspectives.

Empirically, our approach achieves significant improvements in generalization under large-batch training by imposing geometric consistency constraints on the output logits, thereby narrowing the performance gap traditionally observed in large-batch training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u96f6\u4e00\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u6279\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u671f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u7ec4\u4ef6\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u7684\u5951\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u96f6\u4e00\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u957f\u671f\u4ee5\u6765\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u9ec4\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5728n,k\u7ef4\u8d85\u5355\u5f62\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u987a\u5e8f\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f97\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3aSoft-Binary-Argmax\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bfc\u51fa\u5176\u6570\u5b66\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u5982\u4f55\u88ab\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u591a\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5927\u6279\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8f93\u51falogits\u65bd\u52a0\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u5728\u5927\u6279\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u96f6\u4e00\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u6279\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Experiments on an internal advertising QA dataset show consistent gains across expert-judged dimensions including accuracy, completeness, and safety, while reducing the hallucination rate by 72\\%.

Existing noisy robust methods predominantly rely on a simplified binary assumption, treating data as either perfectly clean or completely corrupted. This overlooks the prevalent existence of heterogeneous observation noise, where contamination intensity varies continuously across data. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework termed Quality-Aware Robust Multi-View Clustering (QARMVC). Specifically, QARMVC employs an information bottleneck mechanism to extract intrinsic semantics for view reconstruction. Leveraging the insight that noise disrupts semantic integrity and impedes reconstruction, we utilize the resulting reconstruction discrepancy to precisely quantify fine-grained contamination intensity and derive instance-level quality scores. These scores are integrated into a hierarchical learning strategy: at the feature level, a quality-weighted contrastive objective is designed to adaptively suppress the propagation of noise; at the fusion level, a high-quality global consensus is constructed via quality-weighted aggregation, which is subsequently utilized to align and rectify local views via mutual information maximization.

The advent of large language models (LLMs) provides new zero-shot and few-shot reasoning capabilities, even though machine learning (ML) algorithms, especially ensemble approaches like Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, are excellent at modeling complex, non-linear patient data and routinely beat logistic regression. This research predicts cardiovascular disease using a merged dataset of 1,190 patient records, comparing traditional machine learning models (95.78% accuracy, ROC-AUC 0.96) with open-source large language models via OpenRouter APIs. Finally, a hybrid fusion of the ML ensemble and LLM reasoning under Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved the best results (96.62% accuracy, 0.97 AUC), showing that LLMs (78.9 % accuracy) work best when combined with ML models rather than used alone. Results show that ML ensembles achieved the highest performance (95.78% accuracy, ROC-AUC 0.96), while LLMs performed moderately in zero-shot (78.9%) and slightly better in few-shot (72.6%) settings.

This occurs naturally through measurement rounding, sensor limitations, and lag in economic systems. We study Gaussian mean estimation from coarse data, where each true sample $x$ is drawn from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution with identity covariance, but is revealed only through the set of a partition containing $x$. When the coarse samples, roughly speaking, have ``low'' information, the mean cannot be uniquely recovered from observed samples (i.e., the problem is not identifiable). Recent work by Fotakis, Kalavasis, Kontonis, and Tzamos [FKKT21] established that sample-efficient mean estimation is possible when the unknown mean is identifiable and the partition consists of only convex sets. Moreover, they showed that without convexity, mean estimation becomes NP-hard. However, two fundamental questions remained open: (1) When is the mean identifiable under convex partitions? (2) Is computationally efficient estimation possible under identifiability and convex partitions? This work resolves both questions.

We identify five systems-level attack surfaces, including two emergent failures observed during live testbed operation: coordination-state divergence and induced trust erosion. We frame core security properties as measurable systems metrics: data egress volume, failover window exposure, sovereignty boundary integrity, and provenance chain completeness. Our measurements show that edge-local deployments eliminate routine cloud data exposure but silently degrade sovereignty when fallback mechanisms trigger, with boundary crossings invisible at the application layer. Provenance chains remain complete under cooperative operation yet are trivially bypassed without cryptographic enforcement. Failover windows create transient blind spots exploitable for unauthorised actuation. These results demonstrate that deployment architecture, not just model or prompt design, is a primary determinant of security risk in agent-controlled IoT systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recently, more diffusion guidance methods have emerged with improved generation quality and human preference. However, can these emerging diffusion guidance methods really achieve solid and significant improvements? In this paper, we rethink recent progress on diffusion guidance. Our work mainly consists of four contributions. First, we reveal a critical evaluation pitfall that common human preference models exhibit a strong bias towards large guidance scales. Simply increasing the CFG scale can easily improve quantitative evaluation scores due to strong semantic alignment, even if image quality is severely damaged (e.g., oversaturation and artifacts). Second, we introduce a novel guidance-aware evaluation (GA-Eval) framework that employs effective guidance scale calibration to enable fair comparison between current guidance methods and CFG by identifying the effects orthogonal and parallel to CFG effects. Third, motivated by the evaluation pitfall, we design Transcendent Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method that can significantly improve human preference scores in the conventional evaluation framework but actually does not work in practice.

However, the underlying cause of this failure and a principled solution remain open. In this work, we identify intervention depth as the key factor determining multilingual generalization. Through systematic layer-wise experiments, we characterize two distinct failure modes: shallow-layer interventions achieve erasure but collapse multilingual capabilities in held-out languages, while deep-layer interventions preserve utility but fail to erase target knowledge even in source languages. These findings reveal that the choice of intervention layer is not a free parameter; it fundamentally determines whether multilingual unlearning succeeds. We propose MUTE (Multilingual Unlearning via Targeted Erasure), a framework that uses Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Linguistic Regions Development Score (LRDS) to identify intermediate, language-agnostic layers where cross-lingual representations converge. By restricting unlearning updates to these layers, MUTE achieves robust multilingual knowledge erasure while optimizing on only a small set of source languages.

However, existing feed-forward methods still have potential for further performance gains, especially for out-of-domain data, and struggle to retain second-level inference time once a generative prior is introduced. These limitations stem from the one-shot prediction paradigm in existing feed-forward pipeline: models are strictly bounded by capacity, lack inference-time refinement, and are ill-suited for continuously injecting generative priors. We introduce GIFSplat, a purely feed-forward iterative refinement framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting from sparse unposed views. A small number of forward-only residual updates progressively refine current 3D scene using rendering evidence, achieve favorable balance between efficiency and quality. Furthermore, we distill a frozen diffusion prior into Gaussian-level cues from enhanced novel renderings without gradient backpropagation or ever-increasing view-set expansion, thereby enabling per-scene adaptation with generative prior while preserving feed-forward efficiency.

Materials and Methods: We constructed a dataset from ClinicalTrials.gov comprising 42,112 CTs. Structured, semi-structured trial data, and unstructured protocol-related free-text data were extracted. CTs were assigned binary labels indicating elevated dosing error rate, derived from adverse event reports, MedDRA terminology, and Wilson confidence intervals. We evaluated an XGBoost model trained on structured features, a ClinicalModernBERT model using textual data, and a simple late-fusion model combining both modalities. Post-hoc probability calibration was applied to enable interpretable, trial-level risk stratification. Results: The late-fusion model achieved the highest AUC-ROC (0.862). Beyond discrimination, calibrated outputs enabled robust stratification of CTs into predefined risk categories. The proportion of trials labeled as having an excessively high dosing error rate increased monotonically across higher predicted risk groups and aligned with the corresponding predicted probability ranges. Discussion: These findings indicate that dosing error risk can be anticipated at the trial level using pre-initiation information. Probability calibration was essential for translating model outputs into reliable and interpretable risk categories, while simple multimodal integration yielded performance gains without requiring complex architectures.

However, existing approaches either rely on full-sequence diffusion models with bidirectional generation, which limits temporal causality and real-time applicability, or autoregressive models that suffer from instability and cumulative errors. In this work, we present Causal Motion Diffusion Models (CMDM), a unified framework for autoregressive motion generation based on a causal diffusion transformer that operates in a semantically aligned latent space. CMDM builds upon a Motion-Language-Aligned Causal VAE (MAC-VAE), which encodes motion sequences into temporally causal latent representations. On top of this latent representation, an autoregressive diffusion transformer is trained using causal diffusion forcing to perform temporally ordered denoising across motion frames. To achieve fast inference, we introduce a frame-wise sampling schedule with causal uncertainty, where each subsequent frame is predicted from partially denoised previous frames. The resulting framework supports high-quality text-to-motion generation, streaming synthesis, and long-horizon motion generation at interactive rates.

Although learning-based lossless compressors achieve strong results, most of them are designed for a single modality, leading to redundant compressor deployments in multi-modal settings. Designing a unified multi-modal compressor is critical yet challenging, as different data types vary largely in format, dimension, and statistics. Multi-modal large language models offer a promising resolution but remain too complex for practical use. Thus, we propose \\textbf{OmniZip}, \\textbf{a unified and lightweight lossless compressor for multi-modal data (like image, text, speech, tactile, database, and gene sequence)}. Built on a lightweight backbone, OmniZip incorporates three key components to enable efficient multi-modal lossless compression: a modality-unified tokenizer that reversibly transforms diverse data into tokens, a modality-routing context learning mechanism that enables flexible multi-modal context modeling, and a modality-routing feedforward design that further enhances the model's nonlinear representation flexibility. A reparameterization training strategy is used to enhance model capacity. OmniZip outperforms or matches other state-of-the-art compressors on multiple modalities, achieving 42\\%, 57\\%, 62\\% and 42\\%, 53\\% higher compression efficiency than gzip on CLIC-M, TouchandGo, enwik9, LibriSpeech, and WikiSQL datasets, respectively. It also supports near real-time inference on resource-constrained edge devices, reaching about 1MB/s on MacBook CPUs and iPhone NPUs.

Specifically, we first establish a User-centric Interaction Framework to provide a high-fidelity training gym, enabling agents to dynamically explore diverse strategies with persona-driven users. Then, we introduce Cost-aware Multi-turn Policy Optimization (CMPO) with a hybrid advantage estimation strategy. By integrating generative process credits and employing a PID-Lagrangian cost controller, CMPO effectively guides the policy to explore Pareto boundary between user reward and global cost constraints.

The YOLO series of detectors is among the most well-known CNN-based object detection models and cannot be overlooked. The latest version, YOLOv26, was recently released, while YOLOv12 achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with 55.2 mAP on the COCO val2017 dataset. Meanwhile, transformer-based object detection models, also known as DEtection TRansformer (DETR), have demonstrated impressive performance. RT-DETR is an outstanding model that outperformed the YOLO series in both speed and accuracy when it was released. Its successor, RT-DETRv2, achieved 53.4 mAP on the COCO val2017 dataset. However, despite their remarkable performance, all these models let information to slip away. They primarily focus on the features of foreground objects while neglecting the contextual information provided by the background.

LLMs operate on fragmented token sequences, whereas entities are the fundamental units in knowledge graphs (KGs) scenarios. Existing approaches typically constrain predictions to limited candidate sets or align entities with the LLM's vocabulary by pooling multiple tokens or decomposing entities into fixed-length token sequences, which fail to capture both the semantic meaning of the text and the structural integrity of the graph. To address this, we propose KGT, a novel framework that uses dedicated entity tokens to enable efficient, full-space prediction. Specifically, we first introduce specialized tokenization to construct feature representations at the level of dedicated entity tokens. We then fuse pre-trained structural and textual features into these unified embeddings via a relation-guided gating mechanism, avoiding training from scratch.

To address this, we investigate the latent space of the diffusion model and introduce two components: (1) temporal equivariance regularization and (2) vision foundation model-aligned representation, both applied to the variational autoencoder (VAE) module within the SVD pipeline.

Further analysis indicates that frequent cognitively demanding cases drive inconsistency in human interpretation, posing challenges for perspectivist modeling in IDRR.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728IDRR\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u9488\u5bf9\u6ce8\u91ca\u8005\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u89c6\u89d2\u4e3b\u4e49\u5efa\u6a21\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591aNLP\u4efb\u52a1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u6355\u6349\u8fd9\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u5b8c\u6574\u6ce8\u91ca\u5206\u5e03\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u591a\u6570\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89c6\u89d2\u4e3b\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\u65e8\u5728\u518d\u73b0\u4e2a\u522b\u6ce8\u91ca\u8005\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u9690\u5f0f\u8bdd\u8bed\u5173\u7cfb\u8bc6\u522b\uff08IDRR\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5206\u6b67\u901a\u5e38\u6e90\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u590d\u6742\u6027\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9488\u5bf9\u6ce8\u91ca\u8005\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728IDRR\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9664\u975e\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5219\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8981\u6c42\u6848\u4f8b\u5bfc\u81f4\u4eba\u7c7b\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aIDRR\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u4e3b\u4e49\u5efa\u6a21\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728IDRR\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u9488\u5bf9\u6ce8\u91ca\u8005\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u89c6\u89d2\u4e3b\u4e49\u5efa\u6a21\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Unlike conventional 3D-LUT-based techniques that rely on fusion of basis LUTs, which are usually dense tensors, our unified approach extends the current framework by jointly using residual corrections, which are in fact low-rank tensors, together with a set of basis LUTs. The approach described here improves the existing perceptual quality of an image, which is primarily due to the technique's novel use of residual corrections. At the same time, we achieve the same level of trilinear interpolation complexity, using a significantly smaller number of network, residual corrections, and LUT parameters. The experimental results obtained from LoR-LUT, which is trained on the MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset, reproduce expert-level retouching characteristics with high perceptual fidelity and a sub-megabyte model size. Furthermore, we introduce an interactive visualization tool, termed LoR-LUT Viewer, which transforms an input image into the LUT-adjusted output image, via a number of slidebars that control different parameters. The tool provides an effective way to enhance interpretability and user confidence in the visual results.

However, widespread hydrology data scarcity often restricts data-driven forecasting to isolated predictions. To achieve systemic simulation and reduce reliance on river observations, we present GraphRiverCast (GRC), a topology-informed AI foundation model designed to simulate multivariate river hydrodynamics in global river systems. GRC is capable of operating in a \"ColdStart\" mode, generating predictions without relying on historical river states for initialization. In 7-day global pseudo-hindcasts, GRC-ColdStart functions as a robust standalone simulator, achieving a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of approximately 0.82 without exhibiting the significant error accumulation typical of autoregressive paradigms. Ablation studies reveal that topological encoding serves as indispensable structural information in the absence of historical states, explicitly guiding hydraulic connectivity and network-scale mass redistribution to reconstruct flow dynamics. Furthermore, when adapted locally via a pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, GRC consistently outperforms physics-based and locally-trained AI baselines. Crucially, this superiority extends from gauged reaches to full river networks, underscoring the necessity of topology encoding and physics-based pre-training. Built on a physics-aligned neural operator architecture, GRC enables rapid and cross-scale adaptive simulation, establishing a collaborative paradigm bridging global hydrodynamic knowledge with local hydrological reality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this, we present SettleFL, a trustless and scalable reward settlement protocol designed to minimize total economic friction by offering a family of two interoperable protocols. Leveraging a shared domain-specific circuit architecture, SettleFL offers two interoperable strategies: (1) a Commit-and-Challenge variant that minimizes on-chain costs via optimistic execution and dispute-driven arbitration, and (2) a Commit-with-Proof variant that guarantees instant finality through per-round validity proofs. This design allows the protocol to flexibly adapt to varying latency and cost constraints while enforcing rational robustness without trusted coordination.

The dataset supports three distinct ABSA tasks involving opinion terms, accommodating varying levels of complexity. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct extensive experiments using modern Transformer-based models, including large language models (LLMs), in monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual settings. To address cross-lingual challenges, we propose a translation and label alignment methodology leveraging LLMs, which yields consistent improvements.

We show that this instability arises from a previously underexplored gap between strategy usage-whether a reasoning strategy appears in successful solutions-and strategy executability-whether the strategy remains effective when instantiated as guidance for a target model. Through a controlled analysis of paired human-written and model-generated solutions, we identify a systematic dissociation between usage and executability: human- and model-derived strategies differ in structured, domain-dependent ways, leading to complementary strengths and consistent source-dependent reversals under guidance. Building on this diagnosis, we propose Selective Strategy Retrieval (SSR), a test-time framework that explicitly models executability by selectively retrieving and combining strategies using empirical, multi-route, source-aware signals. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, SSR yields reliable and consistent improvements over direct solving, in-context learning, and single-source guidance, improving accuracy by up to $+13$ points on AIME25 and $+5$ points on Apex for compact reasoning models.

While operational satellite systems often lack full multi-spectral coverage, making RGB-only inference highly desirable for scalable deployment, the adoption of VLFMs for satellite imagery remains hindered by two factors: (1) multi-spectral inputs are informative but difficult to exploit consistently due to band redundancy and misalignment; and (2) CLIP-style text encoders limit semantic expressiveness and weaken fine-grained alignment. We present SATtxt, a spectrum-aware VLFM that operates with RGB inputs only at inference while retaining spectral cues learned during training. Our framework comprises two stages. First, Spectral Representation Distillation transfers spectral priors from a frozen multi-spectral teacher to an RGB student via a lightweight projector. Second, Spectrally Grounded Alignment with Instruction-Augmented LLMs bridges the distilled visual space and an expressive LLM embedding space. Across EuroSAT, BigEarthNet, and ForestNet, SATtxt improves zero-shot classification on average by 4.2%, retrieval by 5.9%, and linear probing by 2.7% over baselines, showing an efficient path toward spectrum-aware vision-language learning for Earth observation.

An Energy-Based Theory and Regularizer for Concept Drift in Electrocardiogram (ECG) Signals", "comment": null, "summary": "Models operating on dynamic physiologic signals must distinguish benign, label-preserving variability from true concept change. Existing concept-drift frameworks are largely distributional and provide no principled guidance on how much a model's internal representation may move when the underlying signal undergoes physiologically plausible fluctuations in energy. As a result, deep models often misinterpret harmless changes in amplitude, rate, or morphology as concept drift, yielding unstable predictions, particularly in multimodal fusion settings.\n  This study introduces Physiologic Energy Conservation Theory (PECT), an energy-based framework for concept stability in dynamic signals. PECT posits that under virtual drift, normalized latent displacement should scale proportionally with normalized signal energy change, while persistent violations of this proportionality indicate real concept drift. We operationalize this principle through Energy-Constrained Representation Learning (ECRL), a lightweight regularizer that penalizes energy-inconsistent latent movement without modifying encoder architectures or adding inference-time cost.\n  Although PECT is formulated for dynamic signals in general, we instantiate and evaluate it on multimodal ECG across seven unimodal and hybrid models. Experiments show that in the strongest trimodal hybrid (1D+2D+Transformer), clean accuracy is largely preserved (96.0% to 94.1%), while perturbed accuracy improves substantially (72.6% to 85.5%) and fused representation drift decreases by over 45%. Similar trends are observed across all architectures, providing empirical evidence that PECT functions as an energy-drift law governing concept stability in continuous physiologic signals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPhysiologic Energy Conservation Theory (PECT)\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u533a\u5206\u826f\u6027\u7684\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u4e0e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u4fe1\u53f7\u7ecf\u5386\u751f\u7406\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6ce2\u52a8\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u79fb\u52a8\u591a\u5c11\u7684\u539f\u7406\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u65e0\u5bb3\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u751f\u7406\u80fd\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u7406\u8bba\uff08PECT\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u53f7\u6982\u5ff5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6846\u67b6\u3002PECT\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u865a\u62df\u6f02\u79fb\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u4f4d\u79fb\u5e94\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u80fd\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u800c\u6301\u7eed\u8fdd\u53cd\u8fd9\u4e00\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6027\u8868\u660e\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ECRL\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u6210\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u60e9\u7f5a\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e00\u539f\u7406\u5177\u4f53\u5316\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1PECT\u662f\u4e3a\u4e00\u822c\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u53f7\u5236\u5b9a\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u5176\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u5e76\u5728\u8de8\u4e03\u4e2a\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001ECG\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u4e09\u6a21\u6001\u6df7\u5408\uff081D+2D+Transformer\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u6e05\u6d01\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u57fa\u672c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0896.0%\u523094.1%\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u53d7\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0872.6%\u523085.5%\uff09\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u8868\u793a\u6f02\u79fb\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8645%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u6240\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u90fd\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3aPECT\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u8fde\u7eed\u751f\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u6982\u5ff5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6f02\u79fb\u5b9a\u5f8b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "Physiologic Energy Conservation Theory (PECT) is an effective framework for concept stability in dynamic signals, which can improve the accuracy and stability of predictions in multimodal fusion settings."}}

However, classical protocols such as BB84, though favored for their simplicity, offer limited resistance to eavesdropping, and perform poorly under realistic noise conditions. Recent research has explored the use of discrete-time Quantum Walks (QWs) to enhance QKD schemes. In this work, we specifically focus on a one-way QKD protocol, where security depends exclusively on the underlying Quantum Walk (QW) topology, rather than the details of the protocol itself. Our paper introduces a novel protocol based on QWs over a hypercube topology and demonstrates that, under identical parameters, it provides significantly enhanced security and noise resistance compared to the circular topology (i.e., state-of-the-art), thereby strengthening protection against eavesdropping. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient and extensible simulation framework for one-way QKD protocols based on QWs, supporting both circular and hypercube topologies. Implemented with IBM's software development kit for quantum computing (i.e., Qiskit), our toolkit enables noise-aware analysis under realistic noise models. To support reproducibility and future developments, we release our entire simulation framework as open-source.

This study introduces Conditioned Comment Prediction (CCP), a task in which a model predicts how a user would comment on a given stimulus by comparing generated outputs with authentic digital traces. This framework enables a rigorous evaluation of current LLM capabilities with respect to the simulation of social media user behavior. We evaluated open-weight 8B models (Llama3.1, Qwen3, Ministral) in English, German, and Luxembourgish language scenarios. By systematically comparing prompting strategies (explicit vs. implicit) and the impact of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), we identify a critical form vs. content decoupling in low-resource settings: while SFT aligns the surface structure of the text output (length and syntax), it degrades semantic grounding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that explicit conditioning (generated biographies) becomes redundant under fine-tuning, as models successfully perform latent inference directly from behavioral histories.

This paper integrates psychometric rater models into the AI pipeline to improve the reliability and validity of conclusions drawn from human judgments. The paper reviews common rater effects, severity and centrality, that distort observed ratings, and demonstrates how item response theory rater models, particularly the multi-faceted Rasch model, can separate true output quality from rater behavior. Using the OpenAI summarization dataset as an empirical example, we show how adjusting for rater severity produces corrected estimates of summary quality and provides diagnostic insight into rater performance.

We address this challenge with SideQuest -- a novel approach that leverages the Large Reasoning Model (LRM) itself to perform KV cache compression by reasoning about the usefulness of tokens in its context. To prevent the tokens associated with this management process from polluting the model's memory, we frame KV cache compression as an auxiliary task executed in parallel to the main reasoning task.

Despite recent progress, most popular approaches focus on tuning pseudo-label thresholds or refining the teacher-student framework, while overlooking object-level structural cues within cross-domain data. In this work, we present CGSA, the first framework that brings Object-Centric Learning (OCL) into SF-DAOD by integrating slot-aware adaptation into the DETR-based detector. Specifically, our approach integrates a Hierarchical Slot Awareness (HSA) module into the detector to progressively disentangle images into slot representations that act as visual priors. These slots are then guided toward class semantics via a Class-Guided Slot Contrast (CGSC) module, maintaining semantic consistency and prompting domain-invariant adaptation. Extensive experiments on multiple cross-domain datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous SF-DAOD methods, with theoretical derivations and experimental analysis further demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed components and the framework, thereby indicating the promise of object-centric design in privacy-sensitive adaptation scenarios.

Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide a principled way to audit such memorization by determining whether a given sample was included in training. However, existing approaches assume access to ground-truth captions. This assumption fails in realistic scenarios where only images are available and their textual annotations remain undisclosed, rendering prior methods ineffective when substituted with vision-language model (VLM) captions. In this work, we propose MoFit, a caption-free MIA framework that constructs synthetic conditioning inputs that are explicitly overfitted to the target model's generative manifold. Given a query image, MoFit proceeds in two stages: (i) model-fitted surrogate optimization, where a perturbation applied to the image is optimized to construct a surrogate in regions of the model's unconditional prior learned from member samples, and (ii) surrogate-driven embedding extraction, where a model-fitted embedding is derived from the surrogate and then used as a mismatched condition for the query image. This embedding amplifies conditional loss responses for member samples while leaving hold-outs relatively less affected, thereby enhancing separability in the absence of ground-truth captions. Our comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and diffusion models demonstrate that MoFit consistently outperforms prior VLM-conditioned baselines and achieves performance competitive with caption-dependent methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoFit\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u5b57\u5e55\u7684MIA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "Latent diffusion models\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMoFit\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u5b57\u5e55\u7684MIA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5408\u6210\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u6837\u672c\u662f\u5426\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "MoFit\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b57\u5e55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "MoFit\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

While recognized as a promising paradigm for visual reasoning, the underlying mechanisms driving its effectiveness remain unclear. Motivated to demystify the true source of its efficacy, we investigate the validity of latent reasoning using Causal Mediation Analysis. We model the process as a causal chain: the input as the treatment, the latent tokens as the mediator, and the final answer as the outcome. Our findings uncover two critical disconnections: (a) Input-Latent Disconnect: dramatic perturbations on the input result in negligible changes to the latent tokens, suggesting that latent tokens do not effectively attend to the input sequence. (b) Latent-Answer Disconnect: perturbations on the latent tokens yield minimal impact on the final answer, indicating the limited causal effect latent tokens imposing on the outcome. Furthermore, extensive probing analysis reveals that latent tokens encode limited visual information and exhibit high similarity. Consequently, we challenge the necessity of latent reasoning and propose a straightforward alternative named CapImagine, which teaches the model to explicitly imagine using text.

This complexity is further compounded in multi-channel scenarios, where effective allocation of budgets and constraints across channels with distinct behavioral patterns becomes critical for optimizing return on investment. Current approaches predominantly rely on either optimization-based strategies or reinforcement learning techniques. However, optimization-based methods lack flexibility in adapting to dynamic market conditions, while reinforcement learning approaches often struggle to capture essential historical dependencies and observational patterns within the constraints of Markov Decision Process frameworks. To address these limitations, we propose AHBid, an Adaptable Hierarchical Bidding framework that integrates generative planning with real-time control. The framework employs a high-level generative planner based on diffusion models to dynamically allocate budgets and constraints by effectively capturing historical context and temporal patterns. We introduce a constraint enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance with specified constraints, along with a trajectory refinement mechanism that enhances adaptability to environmental changes through the utilization of historical data. The system further incorporates a control-based bidding algorithm that synergistically combines historical knowledge with real-time information, significantly improving both adaptability and operational efficacy.

Existing research reveals that LLMs are highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, with effectiveness varying across language contexts. This paper investigates the role of classical Chinese in jailbreak attacks. Owing to its conciseness and obscurity, classical Chinese can partially bypass existing safety constraints, exposing notable vulnerabilities in LLMs. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a framework, CC-BOS, for the automatic generation of classical Chinese adversarial prompts based on multi-dimensional fruit fly optimization, facilitating efficient and automated jailbreak attacks in black-box settings. Prompts are encoded into eight policy dimensions-covering role, behavior, mechanism, metaphor, expression, knowledge, trigger pattern and context; and iteratively refined via smell search, visual search, and cauchy mutation.

Proper mitigation depends on knowing whether a model's answer is based on the prompt or its internal weights. This work focuses on the problem of contributive attribution: identifying the dominant knowledge source behind each output. We show that a probe, a simple linear classifier trained on model hidden representations, can reliably predict contributive attribution. For its training, we introduce AttriWiki, a self-supervised data pipeline that prompts models to recall withheld entities from memory or read them from context, generating labelled examples automatically. Probes trained on AttriWiki data reveal a strong attribution signal, achieving up to 0.96 Macro-F1 on Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen-7B, transferring to out-of-domain benchmarks (SQuAD, WebQuestions) with 0.94-0.99 Macro-F1 without retraining.

We form the block quadrifocal tensor and show that it admits a Tucker decomposition whose factor matrices are the stacked camera matrices, and which thus has a multilinear rank of (4,~4,~4,~4) independent of $n$. We develop the first synchronization algorithm for quadrifocal tensors, using Tucker decomposition, alternating direction method of multipliers, and iteratively reweighted least squares.

As models scale and update across generations, prompt behavior becomes sensitive to shifts in instruction-following policies, alignment regimes, and decoding strategies, a phenomenon we characterize as GPT-scale model drift. Under such conditions, surface-level formatting conventions and ad hoc refinement are insufficient to ensure stable, interpretable control. This paper reconceptualizes Natural Language Declarative Prompting (NLD-P) as a declarative governance method rather than a rigid field template. NLD-P is formalized as a modular control abstraction that separates provenance, constraint logic, task content, and post-generation evaluation, encoded directly in natural language without reliance on external orchestration code. We define minimal compliance criteria, analyze model-dependent schema receptivity, and position NLD-P as an accessible governance framework for non-developer practitioners operating within evolving LLM ecosystems. Portions of drafting and editorial refinement employed a schema-bound LLM assistant configured under NLD-P.

Our observations suggest that this fragility stems from an imbalanced learning process, where the model develops an implicit preference for certain modalities, leading to the under-optimization of others. We propose a simple yet efficient method to address this challenge. The central insight of our work is that the dominance relationship between modalities can be effectively discerned and quantified in the frequency domain. To leverage this principle, we first introduce a Frequency Ratio Metric (FRM) to quantify modality preference by analyzing features in the frequency domain. Guided by FRM, we then propose a Multimodal Weight Allocation Module, a plug-and-play component that dynamically re-balances the contribution of each branch during training, promoting a more holistic learning paradigm.

As deep networks and large language models continue to scale, their internal behavior becomes increasingly opaque, leading to hallucinations, fragile generalization under distribution shift, and growing computational and energy demands. By analyzing the eigenvalue dynamics of hidden activations across layers and inputs, this work shows that spectral statistics provide a compact, stable, and interpretable lens on model behavior, capable of separating structured, causal representations from noise-dominated variability. Within this framework, the first contribution, EigenTrack, introduces a real-time method for detecting hallucinations and out-of-distribution behavior in large language and vision-language models. EigenTrack transforms streaming activations into spectral descriptors such as entropy, variance, and deviations from the Marchenko-Pastur baseline, and models their temporal evolution using lightweight recurrent classifiers, enabling early detection of reliability failures before they appear in model outputs while offering interpretable insight into representation dynamics. The second contribution, RMT-KD, presents a principled approach to compressing deep networks via random matrix theoretic knowledge distillation. By interpreting outlier eigenvalues in activation spectra as carriers of task-relevant information, RMT-KD progressively projects networks onto lower-dimensional subspaces through iterative self-distillation, yielding significantly more compact and energy-efficient models while preserving accuracy and dense, hardware-friendly structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c31\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165EigenTrack\u548cRMT-KD\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c31\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u9690\u85cf\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u8c31\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86EigenTrack\u548cRMT-KD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387"}}

Such capabilities could allow misaligned models to evade oversight mechanisms. Yet principled methods to detect and quantify such behaviours are lacking. Classical definitions of steganography, and detection methods based on them, require a known reference distribution of non-steganographic signals. For the case of steganographic reasoning in LLMs, knowing such a reference distribution is not feasible; this renders these approaches inapplicable. We propose an alternative, \\textbf{decision-theoretic view of steganography}. Our central insight is that steganography creates an asymmetry in usable information between agents who can and cannot decode the hidden content (present within a steganographic signal), and this otherwise latent asymmetry can be inferred from the agents' observable actions. To formalise this perspective, we introduce generalised $\\mathcal{V}$-information: a utilitarian framework for measuring the amount of usable information within some input. We use this to define the \\textbf{steganographic gap} -- a measure that quantifies steganography by comparing the downstream utility of the steganographic signal to agents that can and cannot decode the hidden content.

Recent models, such as DeepSeek-R1, have also shown RLHF's potential to improve LLM reasoning on complex tasks. In RL, inference and training co-exist, creating dynamic resource demands throughout the workflow. Compared to traditional RL, RLHF further challenges training efficiency due to expanding model sizes and resource consumption. Several RLHF frameworks aim to balance flexible abstraction and efficient execution. However, they rely on serverful infrastructures, which struggle with fine-grained resource variability. As a result, during synchronous RLHF training, idle time between or within RL components often causes overhead and resource wastage.\n  To address these issues, we present RLHFless, the first scalable training framework for synchronous RLHF, built on serverless computing environments. RLHFless adapts to dynamic resource demands throughout the RLHF pipeline, pre-computes shared prefixes to avoid repeated computation, and uses a cost-aware actor scaling strategy that accounts for response length variation to find sweet spots with lower cost and higher speed. In addition, RLHFless assigns workloads efficiently to reduce intra-function imbalance and idle time.

Built on the Napari multi-dimensional viewer, box/point prompting is integrated with SAM2-style propagation by treating a 3D volume as a slice sequence, enabling mask propagation from sparse prompts using Medical-SAM2 on top of SAM2. Voxel-level annotation remains essential for developing and validating medical imaging algorithms, yet manual labeling is slow and expensive for 3D scans, and existing integrations frequently emphasize per-slice interaction without providing a unified, cohort-oriented workflow for navigation, propagation, interactive correction, and quantitative export in a single local pipeline. To address this practical limitation, a local-first Napari workflow is provided for efficient 3D annotation across multiple studies using standard DICOM series and/or NIfTI volumes. Users can annotate cases sequentially under a single root folder with explicit proceed/skip actions, initialize objects via box-first prompting (including first/last-slice initialization for single-object propagation), refine predictions with point prompts, and finalize labels through prompt-first correction prior to saving.

While differential privacy (DP) provides a principled framework for such guarantees, standard DP finetuning (e.g., with DP-SGD) often results in severe degradation of image quality, particularly in high-frequency textures, due to the indiscriminate addition of noise across all model parameters. In this work, we propose a spectral DP framework based on the hypothesis that the most privacy-sensitive portions of an image are often low-frequency components in the wavelet space (e.g., facial features and object shapes) while high-frequency components are largely generic and public. Based on this hypothesis, we propose the following two-stage framework for DP image generation with coarse image intermediaries: (1) DP finetune an autoregressive spectral image tokenizer model on the low-resolution wavelet coefficients of the sensitive images, and (2) perform high-resolution upsampling using a publicly pretrained super-resolution model. By restricting the privacy budget to the global structures of the image in the first stage, and leveraging the post-processing property of DP for detail refinement, we achieve promising trade-offs between privacy and utility.

However, due to the complex reasoning processes and substantial individual differences involved in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinical diagnosis and treatment, traditional RAG methods often exhibit poor performance in this domain. Objective: To address the limitations of conventional RAG approaches in TCM applications, this study aims to develop an improved RAG framework tailored to the characteristics of TCM reasoning. Methods: We developed TCM-DiffRAG, an innovative RAG framework that integrates knowledge graphs (KG) with chains of thought (CoT). TCM-DiffRAG was evaluated on three distinctive TCM test datasets. Results: The experimental results demonstrated that TCM-DiffRAG achieved significant performance improvements over native LLMs. For example, the qwen-plus model achieved scores of 0.927, 0.361, and 0.038, which were significantly enhanced to 0.952, 0.788, and 0.356 with TCM-DiffRAG. The improvements were even more pronounced for non-Chinese LLMs. Additionally, TCM-DiffRAG outperformed directly supervised fine-tuned (SFT) LLMs and other benchmark RAG methods. Conclusions: TCM-DiffRAG shows that integrating structured TCM knowledge graphs with Chain of Thought based reasoning substantially improves performance in individualized diagnostic tasks. The joint use of universal and personalized knowledge graphs enables effective alignment between general knowledge and clinical reasoning. These results highlight the potential of reasoning-aware RAG frameworks for advancing LLM applications in traditional Chinese medicine.", "AI": {"tldr": "TCM-DiffRAG\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2d\u533b\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u548c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e2d\u533b\u9886\u57df\u7684RAG\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e2d\u533b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u533b\u63a8\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6539\u8fdbRAG\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86TCM-DiffRAG\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u7684RAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff08KG\uff09\u4e0e\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u4e2d\u533b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86TCM-DiffRAG\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTCM-DiffRAG\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\uff0cqwen-plus\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u4f7f\u7528TCM-DiffRAG\u65f6\u7684\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a0.927\u30010.361\u548c0.038\uff0c\u800c\u4f7f\u7528TCM-DiffRAG\u540e\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.952\u30010.788\u548c0.356\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u4e2d\u6587LLM\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u66f4\u4e3a\u660e\u663e\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cTCM-DiffRAG\u8fd8\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09LLM\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u51c6RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TCM-DiffRAG\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u4e2d\u533b\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bca\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8054\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u901a\u7528\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u822c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u611f\u77e5RAG\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u63a8\u8fdbLLM\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u4e2d\u533b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To address common challenges like data sparsity and cold start, recent researchs have leveraged data from multiple auxiliary domains to enrich information within the target domain. However, inherent domain gaps can degrade the quality of mixed-domain data, leading to negative transfer and diminished model performance. Existing prevailing \\emph{model-centric} paradigm -- which relies on complex, customized architectures -- struggles to capture the subtle, non-structural sequence dependencies across domains, leading to poor generalization and high demands on computational resources.

To overcome this limitation, we propose DPCache, a novel training-free acceleration framework that formulates diffusion sampling acceleration as a global path planning problem. DPCache constructs a Path-Aware Cost Tensor from a small calibration set to quantify the path-dependent error of skipping timesteps conditioned on the preceding key timestep. Leveraging this tensor, DPCache employs dynamic programming to select an optimal sequence of key timesteps that minimizes the total path cost while preserving trajectory fidelity. During inference, the model performs full computations only at these key timesteps, while intermediate outputs are efficiently predicted using cached features. Extensive experiments on DiT, FLUX, and HunyuanVideo demonstrate that DPCache achieves strong acceleration with minimal quality loss, outperforming prior acceleration methods by $+$0.031 ImageReward at 4.87$\\times$ speedup and even surpassing the full-step baseline by $+$0.028 ImageReward at 3.54$\\times$ speedup on FLUX, validating the effectiveness of our path-aware global scheduling framework.

This variation, arising from baseline biological structure or technical effects, can prevent standard dimensionality reduction methods from resolving condition-specific structure. The challenge is that these confounding topics are often unknown and mixed with biological signals. Existing background correction methods are either unscalable to high dimensions or not interpretable. We introduce background contrastive Non-negative Matrix Factorization (\\model), which extracts target-enriched latent topics by jointly factorizing a target dataset and a matched background using shared non-negative bases under a contrastive objective that suppresses background-expressed structure. This approach yields non-negative components that are directly interpretable at the feature level, and explicitly isolates target-specific variation. \\model is learned by an efficient multiplicative update algorithm via matrix multiplication such that it is highly efficient on GPU hardware and scalable to big data via minibatch training akin to deep learning approach. Across simulations and diverse biological datasets, \\model reveals signals obscured by conventional methods, including disease-associated programs in postmortem depressive brain single-cell RNA-seq, genotype-linked protein expression patterns in mice, treatment-specific transcriptional changes in leukemia, and TP53-dependent drug responses in cancer cell lines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u975e\u8d1f\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u751f\u7269\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e38\u88ab\u6761\u4ef6\u95f4\u5171\u6709\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u53d8\u5f02\u6240\u63a9\u76d6\uff0c\u8fd9\u963b\u6b62\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u964d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3abackground contrastive Non-negative Matrix Factorization (background contrastive NMF)\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5206\u89e3\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5339\u914d\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u975e\u8d1f\u57fa\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u76ee\u6807\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4e3b\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u751f\u7269\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a9\u76d6\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u8111\u5355\u7ec6\u80deRNA-seq\u4e2d\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u76f8\u5173\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3001\u5c0f\u9f20\u4e2d\u4e0e\u57fa\u56e0\u578b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8868\u8fbe\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u767d\u8840\u75c5\u4e2d\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8f6c\u5f55\u53d8\u5316\u4ee5\u53ca\u764c\u7ec6\u80de\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684TP53\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u836f\u7269\u53cd\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u53d6\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

This uncertainty is central to understanding both scientific acceleration and dual-use risk. We conducted a multi-model, multi-benchmark human uplift study comparing novices with LLM access versus internet-only access across eight biosecurity-relevant task sets. Participants worked on complex problems with ample time (up to 13 hours for the most involved tasks). We found that LLM access provided substantial uplift: novices with LLMs were 4.16 times more accurate than controls (95% CI [2.63, 6.87]). On four benchmarks with available expert baselines (internet-only), novices with LLMs outperformed experts on three of them. Perhaps surprisingly, standalone LLMs often exceeded LLM-assisted novices, indicating that users were not eliciting the strongest available contributions from the LLMs. Most participants (89.6%) reported little difficulty obtaining dual-use-relevant information despite safeguards.

In practice, these models are predominantly trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), yet most existing outcome-only RLVR pipelines rely almost exclusively on a binary correctness signal and largely ignore the model's intrinsic uncertainty. We term this discrepancy the uncertainty-reward mismatch, under which high- and low-uncertainty solutions are treated equivalently, preventing the policy from \"Know What You Know\" and impeding the shift from optimizing for correct answers to optimizing effective reasoning paths. This limitation is especially critical in reasoning-centric tasks such as mathematics and question answering, where performance hinges on the quality of the model's internal reasoning process rather than mere memorization of final answers. To address this, we propose EGPO, a metacognitive entropy calibration framework that explicitly integrates intrinsic uncertainty into RLVR for enhancing LRMs. EGPO estimates per-sample uncertainty using a zero-overhead entropy proxy derived from token-level likelihoods and aligns it with extrinsic correctness through an asymmetric calibration mechanism that preserves correct reasoning while selectively regulating overconfident failures, thereby enabling stable and uncertainty-aware policy optimization. Moreover, EGPO recovers informative learning signals from otherwise degenerate group-based rollouts without modifying the verifier or reward definition. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed EGPO leads to substantial and consistent improvements in reasoning performance, establishing a principled path for advancing LRMs through metacognitive entropy calibration.", "AI": {"tldr": "EGPO\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u71b5\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LRMs\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u95ee\u7b54\u7b49\u63a8\u7406\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "method": "EGPO\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u71b5\u6821\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5185\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u96c6\u6210\u5230RLVR\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3aLRMs\u3002", "result": "EGPO\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u663e\u8457\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u71b5\u6821\u51c6\u63a8\u8fdbLRMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "EGPO\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027-\u5956\u52b1\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LRMs\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This study proposes an interpretable machine learning framework to predict MDR in bacterial isolates using clinical features and antibiotic susceptibility patterns. Five classification models were evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM. The models were trained on a curated dataset of 9,714 isolates, with resistance encoded at the antibiotic family level to capture cross-class resistance patterns consistent with MDR definitions. Performance assessment included accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient. Ensemble models, particularly XGBoost and LightGBM, demonstrated superior predictive capability across all metrics. To address the clinical transparency gap, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) was applied to generate instance-level explanations. LIME identified resistance to quinolones, Co-trimoxazole, Colistin, aminoglycosides, and Furanes as the strongest contributors to MDR predictions, aligning with known biological mechanisms. The results show that combining high-performing models with local interpretability provides both accuracy and actionable insights for antimicrobial stewardship.

Disagreement follows an inverted-U with completion quality (AUC = 0.689), confirming physicians agree on clearly good or bad outputs but split on borderline cases.

We present MolFM-Lite, a multi-modal model that jointly encodes SELFIES sequences (1D), molecular graphs (2D), and conformer ensembles (3D) through cross-attention fusion, while conditioning predictions on experimental context via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). Our main methodological contributions are: (1) a conformer ensemble attention mechanism that combines learnable attention with Boltzmann-weighted priors over multiple RDKit-generated conformers, capturing the thermodynamic distribution of molecular shapes; and (2) a cross-modal fusion layer where each modality can attend to others, enabling complementary information sharing. We evaluate on four MoleculeNet scaffold-split benchmarks using our model's own splits, and report all baselines re-evaluated under the same protocol.

This stems from the ''combinatorial contradiction'' phenomenon, where parallel tokens form semantically inconsistent combinations. We address this by integrating continuous representations into the discrete decoding process, as they preserve rich inter-position dependency. We propose ReMix (Rejection Mixing), a framework that introduces a novel Continuous Mixing State as an intermediate between the initial masked state and the final decoded token state. This intermediate state allows a token's representation to be iteratively refined in a continuous space, resolving mutual conflicts with other tokens before collapsing into a final discrete sample. Furthermore, a rejection rule reverts uncertain representations from the continuous state back to the masked state for reprocessing, ensuring stability and preventing error propagation. ReMix thus mitigates combinatorial contradictions by enabling continuous-space refinement during discrete diffusion decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReMix, as a training-free method, achieves a $2-8 \\times$ inference speedup without any quality degradation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The benefits of delay are highly sensitive to participants' sojourn times and departure behavior, and delaying matches can impose significant costs, including longer waiting times and increased market congestion. These competing effects make fixed matching policies inherently inflexible in dynamic environments. We propose a learning-based Hybrid framework that adaptively combines immediate and delayed matching. The framework continuously collects data on user departures over time, estimates the underlying departure distribution via regression, and determines whether to delay matching in the subsequent period based on a decision threshold that governs the system's tolerance for matching efficiency loss. The proposed framework can substantially reduce waiting times and congestion while sacrificing only a limited amount of matching efficiency. By dynamically adjusting its matching strategy, the Hybrid framework enables system performance to flexibly interpolate between purely greedy and purely patient policies, offering a robust and adaptive alternative to static matching mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e02\u573a\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u62e5\u5835\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e02\u573a\u6548\u7387", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6", "result": "\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u62e5\u5835\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u727a\u7272\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5339\u914d\u6548\u7387", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848"}}

We propose Stitching Noisy Diffusion Thoughts, a self-consistency framework that turns cheap diffusion-sampled reasoning into a reusable pool of step-level candidates. Given a problem, we (i) sample many diverse, low-cost reasoning trajectories using a masked diffusion language model, (ii) score every intermediate step with an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM), and (iii) stitch these highest-quality steps across trajectories into a composite rationale. This rationale then conditions an autoregressive (AR) model (solver) to recompute only the final answer. This modular pipeline separates exploration (diffusion) from evaluation and solution synthesis, avoiding monolithic unified hybrids while preserving broad search. Across math reasoning benchmarks, we find that step-level recombination is most beneficial on harder problems, and ablations highlight the importance of the final AR solver in converting stitched but imperfect rationales into accurate answers. Using low-confidence diffusion sampling with parallel, independent rollouts, our training-free framework improves average accuracy by up to 23.8% across six math and coding tasks.

While effective in many settings, this constraint can limit flexibility in controlling attention magnitudes and may contribute to overly concentrated or unstable attention patterns during training. Prior work has explored modifications such as attention sinks or gating mechanisms, but these approaches provide only limited or indirect control over attention reweighting. We propose Affine-Scaled Attention, a simple extension to standard attention that introduces input-dependent scaling and a corresponding bias term applied to softmax-normalized attention weights. This design relaxes the strict normalization constraint while maintaining aggregation of value representations, allowing the model to adjust both the relative distribution and the scale of attention in a controlled manner.\n  We empirically evaluate Affine-Scaled Attention in large-scale language model pretraining across multiple model sizes. Experimental results show consistent improvements in training stability, optimization behavior, and downstream task performance compared to standard softmax attention and attention sink baselines.

We address this gap by proposing a conceptual model that reframes behavior as an interpretive outcome integrating Scene (observable situation), Context (user-constructed meaning), and Human Behavior Factors (determinants shaping behavioral likelihood). Grounded in multidisciplinary perspectives across the humanities, social sciences, HCI, and engineering, the model separates what is observable from what is meaningful to the user and explains how the same scene can yield different behavioral meanings and outcomes. To translate this lens into design action, we derive five agent design principles (behavioral alignment, contextual sensitivity, temporal appropriateness, motivational calibration, and agency preservation) that guide intervention depth, timing, intensity, and restraint. Together, the model and principles provide a foundation for designing agentic AI systems that act with contextual sensitivity and judgment in interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposed model and principles enhance agentic AI's proactive intervention capabilities.", "motivation": "Addressing the gap in agentic AI's proactive intervention due to lack of principled judgment.", "method": "Proposing a conceptual model integrating Scene, Context, and Human Behavior Factors.", "result": "Deriving five agent design principles for designing context-sensitive and judicious agentic AI systems.", "conclusion": "The model and principles provide a foundation for designing agentic AI systems with contextual sensitivity and judgment."}}

We start from a simple hypothesis: if a post-review recommender is trained with an explicit fairness regularizer, it should increase inclusion without degrading quality. To test this, we introduce Fair-PaperRec, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with a differentiable fairness loss over intersectional attributes (e.g., race, country) that re-ranks papers after double-blind review. We first probe the hypothesis on synthetic datasets spanning high, moderate, and near-fair biases. Across multiple randomized runs, these controlled studies map where increasing the fairness weight strengthens macro/micro diversity while keeping utility approximately stable, demonstrating robustness and adaptability under varying disparity levels. We then carry the hypothesis into the original setting, conference data from ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI), Designing Interactive Systems (DIS), and Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI). In this real-world scenario, an appropriately tuned configuration of Fair-PaperRec achieves up to a 42.03% increase in underrepresented-group participation with at most a 3.16% change in overall utility relative to the historical selection. Taken together, the synthetic-to-original progression shows that fairness regularization can act as both an equity mechanism and a mild quality regularizer, especially in highly biased regimes.

With the recent progress of language technologies, there is an increasing interest in automatic CRF-filling from clinical notes, mostly based on the use of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, there is a general scarcity of annotated CRF data, both for training and testing LLMs, which limits the progress on this task. As a step in the direction of providing such data, we present a new dataset of clinical notes from an Italian Emergency Department annotated with respect to a pre-defined CRF containing 134 items to be filled. We provide an analysis of the data, define the CRF-filling task and metric for its evaluation, and report on pilot experiments where we use an open-source state-of-the-art LLM to automatically execute the task.

However, the lack of experimental spectra hinders the attachment of each molecular identification, and thus urges the establishment of prediction approaches for computational models. Deep learning models appear promising for predicting molecular structure spectra, but overall assessment remains challenging as a result of the heterogeneity in methods and the lack of well-defined benchmarks. To address this, our contribution is the creation of benchmark framework FlexMS for constructing and evaluating diverse model architectures in mass spectrum prediction. With its easy-to-use flexibility, FlexMS supports the dynamic construction of numerous distinct combinations of model architectures, while assessing their performance on preprocessed public datasets using different metrics. In this paper, we provide insights into factors influencing performance, including the structural diversity of datasets, hyperparameters like learning rate and data sparsity, pretraining effects, metadata ablation settings and cross-domain transfer learning analysis. This provides practical guidance in choosing suitable models.

Specifically, GNNs suffer from a Semantic Wall of feature over smoothing in dense or heterophilic networks, and a Systems Wall driven by the O(N^2) memory constraints of pairwise clustering. To dismantle these barriers, we introduce ECHO (Encoding Communities via High order Operators), a scalable, self supervised architecture that reframes community detection as an adaptive, multi scale diffusion process. ECHO features a Topology Aware Router that automatically analyzes structural heuristics sparsity, density, and assortativity to route graphs through the optimal inductive bias, preventing heterophilic poisoning while ensuring semantic densification. Coupled with a memory sharded full batch contrastive objective and a novel chunked O(N \\cdot K) similarity extraction method, ECHO completely bypasses traditional O(N^2) memory bottlenecks without sacrificing the mathematical precision of global gradients. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that this topology feature synergy consistently overcomes the classical resolution limit. On synthetic LFR benchmarks scaled up to 1 million nodes, ECHO achieves scale invariant accuracy despite severe topological noise. Furthermore, on massive real world social networks with over 1.6 million nodes and 30 million edges, it completes clustering in mere minutes with throughputs exceeding 2,800 nodes per second matching the speed of highly optimized purely topological baselines. The implementation utilizes a unified framework that automatically engages memory sharded optimization to support adoption across varying hardware constraints.

This study investigates the fossilization and stability of the L2 syntax-prosody interface by comparing 67 native Mandarin speakers with 67 Vietnamese learners using the BLCU-SAIT corpus. By integrating C-ToBI boundary annotation with Dependency Grammar analysis, we examined both the quantity of prosodic boundaries and their mapping to syntactic relations. Results reveal a non-linear acquisition: although high-proficiency learners (VNH) converge to the native baseline in boundary quantity at the Major Phrase level (B3), their structural mapping significantly diverges. Specifically, VNH demote the prosodic boundary at the Subject-Verb (SBV) interface (Major Phrase B3 -> Prosodic Word B1), while erroneously promoting the boundary at the Verb-Object (VOB) interface (Prosodic Word B1 -> Major Phrase B3). This strategy allows learners to maintain high long phrasal output at the expense of structural accuracy. This results in a distorted prosodic hierarchy where the native pattern is inverted.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce TRC$^{2}$ (Thalamically Routed Cortical Columns), a decoder-only backbone that addresses continual learning at the architectural level. TRC$^{2}$ combines sparse thalamic routing over cortical columns with mechanisms for modulation, prediction, memory, and feedback, together with a fast corrective pathway that supports rapid adaptation without destabilizing slower parameters.

Therefore, this paper proposes a Large Language Model Hyperbolic Aligned Knowledge Tracing(L-HAKT). First, the teacher agent deeply parses question semantics and explicitly constructs hierarchical dependencies of knowledge points; the student agent simulates learning behaviors to generate synthetic data. Then, contrastive learning is performed between synthetic and real data in hyperbolic space to reduce distribution differences in key features such as question difficulty and forgetting patterns. Finally, by optimizing hyperbolic curvature, we explicitly model the tree-like hierarchical structure of knowledge points, precisely characterizing differences in learning curve morphology for knowledge points at different levels.

However, their inherited position-dependent modeling mechanism, Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), remains suboptimal for 3D multimodal understanding. The vanilla RoPE formulation fails to preserve essential three-dimensional spatial structures when encoding 3D tokens, and its relative distance computation overlooks angular dependencies, hindering the model's ability to capture directional variations in visual representations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Spherical Coordinate-based Positional Embedding (SoPE). Our method maps point-cloud token indices into a 3D spherical coordinate space, enabling unified modeling of spatial locations and directional angles. This formulation preserves the inherent geometric structure of point-cloud data, enhances spatial awareness, and yields more consistent and expressive geometric representations for multimodal learning.

Most existing knowledge distillation (KD) methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), relying on fixed teacher traces or teacher-student Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization. When combined with RL, these approaches often suffer from distribution mismatch and objective interference: teacher supervision may not align with the student's evolving rollout distribution, and the KL regularizer can compete with reward maximization and require careful loss balancing. To address these issues, we propose RL-aware distillation (RLAD), which performs selective imitation during RL -- guiding the student toward the teacher only when it improves the current policy update. Our core component, Trust Region Ratio Distillation (TRRD), replaces the teacher-student KL regularizer with a PPO/GRPO-style likelihood-ratio objective anchored to a teacher--old-policy mixture, yielding advantage-aware, trust-region-bounded distillation on student rollouts and naturally balancing exploration, exploitation, and imitation.

Accessible information is bounded by the Generalized Mutual Information (GMI), with degradation scaling with distributional distance and decoder sensitivity. The bound is a property of the decoder's scoring rule, not of any particular architecture; it applies whether non-text inputs arrive through a learned projection, a discrete codebook, or no explicit adapter at all. We validate this across five models spanning speech and vision. A controlled experiment (two Prismatic VLMs differing only in encoder text-alignment) confirms the bottleneck is the decoder's scoring rule, not the encoder or projection.

We present a diffusion-based ultrasound despeckling method built on the Image Restoration Stochastic Differential Equations framework. To enable supervised training, we curate large paired datasets by simulating ultrasound images from speckle-free magnetic resonance images using the Matlab UltraSound Toolbox. The proposed model reconstructs speckle-suppressed images while preserving anatomically meaningful edges and contrast.

Current agentic benchmarks assume domain-specific integration, encoding task information in ways that preclude fair evaluation of general agents.

We propose conceptual principles for such evaluation, a Unified Protocol enabling agent-benchmark integration, and Exgentic - a practical framework for general agent evaluation.

To address this, we introduce HulluEdit, a single-pass, reference-free intervention framework. Our core innovation is orthogonal subspace editing: we decompose the hidden states of the model into orthogonal subspaces - visual evidence, conflicting priors, and residual uncertainty - enabling selective suppression of hallucinatory patterns without interfering with visual grounding. This approach mathematically guarantees that edits applied to the prior subspace leave the visual component entirely unaffected. Extensive experiments show that HulluEdit achieves state-of-the-art hallucination reduction on benchmarks including POPE and CHAIR across diverse architectures, while preserving general capabilities on MME and maintaining efficient inference.

This paper proposes Space Syntax-guided Post-training (SSPT), a post-training paradigm that explicitly injects space syntax knowledge into floor plan generation via a non-differentiable oracle. The oracle converts RPLAN-style layouts into rectangle-space graphs through greedy maximal-rectangle decomposition and door-mediated adjacency construction, and then computes integration-based measurements to quantify public space dominance and functional hierarchy.\n  To enable consistent evaluation and diagnosis, we further introduce SSPT-Bench (Eval-8), an out-of-distribution benchmark that post-trains models using conditions capped at $\\leq 7$ rooms while evaluating on 8-room programs, together with a unified metric suite for dominance, stability, and profile alignment. SSPT is instantiated with two strategies: (i) iterative retraining via space-syntax filtering and diffusion fine-tuning, and (ii) reinforcement learning via PPO with space-syntax rewards. Experiments show that both strategies improve public-space dominance and restore clearer functional hierarchy compared to distribution-fitted baselines, while PPO achieves stronger gains with substantially higher compute efficiency and reduced variance.

In contrast, these signatures largely disappear in the generated images, with classification accuracy dropping to at most 50\\% even for the state-of-the-art Flux model. To better understand this cross-modal discrepancy, we further analyze the data and find that the generated images fail to preserve key variations present in captions, such as differences in the level of detail, emphasis on color and texture, and the distribution of objects within a scene.

Despite their success, modern deep forecasting models are typically trained to minimize point-wise prediction loss without leveraging the rich information contained in past prediction residuals from rolling forecasts - residuals that reflect persistent biases, unmodeled patterns, or evolving dynamics. We propose TEFL (Temporal Error Feedback Learning), a unified learning framework that explicitly incorporates these historical residuals into the forecasting pipeline during both training and evaluation. To make this practical in deep multi-step settings, we address three key challenges: (1) selecting observable multi-step residuals under the partial observability of rolling forecasts, (2) integrating them through a lightweight low-rank adapter to preserve efficiency and prevent overfitting, and (3) designing a two-stage training procedure that jointly optimizes the base forecaster and error module. Extensive experiments across 10 real-world datasets and 5 backbone architectures show that TEFL consistently improves accuracy, reducing MAE by 5-10% on average. Moreover, it demonstrates strong robustness under abrupt changes and distribution shifts, with error reductions exceeding 10% (up to 19.5%) in challenging scenarios.

In contrast, genuinely non-AR generation is promising because it removes AR's sequential bottleneck, better exploiting parallel hardware to reduce synchronization/communication overhead and improve latency scaling with output length. We argue that a primary driver of AR-like decoding is a mismatch between DLM objectives and the highly sequential structure of widely used training data, including standard pretraining corpora and long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose NAP (Non-Autoregressive Parallel DLMs), a proof-of-concept, data-centric approach that better aligns supervision with non-AR parallel decoding. NAP curates examples as multiple independent reasoning trajectories and couples them with a parallel-forced decoding strategy that encourages multi-token parallel updates. Across math reasoning benchmarks, NAP yields stronger performance under parallel decoding than DLMs trained on standard long CoT data, with gains growing as parallelism increases. Our results suggest that revisiting data and supervision is a principled direction for mitigating AR-like behavior and moving toward genuinely non-autoregressive parallel generation in DLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/pixeli99/NAP.", "code_url": "https://github.com/pixeli99/NAP", "code_stars": 2, "code_last_update": "2026-02-27", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NAP\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5e76\u884cDLMs\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3AR-like\u89e3\u7801\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3DLMs\u4e2dAR-like\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NAP\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "NAP\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u793a\u4f8b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u6574\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5e76\u884c\u5f3a\u5236\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u9f13\u52b1\u591a\u4ee4\u724c\u5e76\u884c\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cNAP\u5728\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u957fCoT\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684DLMs\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u589e\u76ca\u4e5f\u5728\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u6570\u636e\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u662f\u51cf\u8f7bAR-like\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u671d\u7740DLMs\u4e2d\u771f\u6b63\u975e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u8fc8\u8fdb\u7684\u5408\u7406\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We propose the Discourse-Aware Dual-Track Streaming Response (DDTSR) framework, a low-latency architecture that enables listen-while-thinking and speak-while-thinking. DDTSR is built upon three key mechanisms: (1) connective-guided small-large model synergy, where an auxiliary small model generates minimal-committal discourse connectives while a large model performs knowledge-intensive reasoning in parallel; (2) streaming-based cross-modal collaboration, which dynamically overlaps ASR, LLM inference, and TTS to advance the earliest speakable moment; and (3) curriculum-learning-based discourse continuity enhancement, which maintains coherence and logical consistency between early responses and subsequent reasoning outputs.

Existing approaches often require task-specific training or slow optimization, and enforcing hard constraints frequently disrupts motion naturalness. Building on the observation that many animation tasks can be formulated as a linear inverse problem, we introduce ProjFlow, a training-free sampler that achieves zero-shot, exact satisfaction of linear spatial constraints while preserving motion realism. Our key advance is a novel kinematics-aware metric that encodes skeletal topology. This metric allows the sampler to enforce hard constraints by distributing corrections coherently across the entire skeleton, avoiding the unnatural artifacts of naive projection. Furthermore, for sparse inputs, such as filling in long gaps between a few keyframes, we introduce a time-varying formulation using pseudo-observations that fade during sampling. Extensive experiments on representative applications, motion inpainting, and 2D-to-3D lifting, demonstrate that ProjFlow achieves exact constraint satisfaction and matches or improves realism over zero-shot baselines, while remaining competitive with training-based controllers.", "AI": {"tldr": "ProjFlow\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u8fd0\u52a8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u6162\u901f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u5f3a\u5236\u5b9e\u65bd\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u5f80\u5f80\u7834\u574f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ProjFlow\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7cbe\u786e\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ebf\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u3002\u5176\u5173\u952e\u8fdb\u6b65\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u611f\u77e5\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5b83\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u9aa8\u9abc\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u8be5\u5ea6\u91cf\u5141\u8bb8\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u9aa8\u9abc\u4e0a\u8fde\u8d2f\u5730\u5206\u5e03\u6821\u6b63\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u5b9e\u65bd\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u907f\u514d\u7b80\u5355\u6295\u5f71\u7684 unnatural artifacts\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5982\u586b\u5145\u5c11\u91cf\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u4e4b\u95f4\u8f83\u957f\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u4f2a\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u503c\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9010\u6e10\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fee\u590d\u548c2D\u52303D\u63d0\u5347\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cProjFlow\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u4e0e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ProjFlow\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u8fd0\u52a8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

Project page: https://sparta-projectpage.github.io/", "summary": "Real-world Table-Text question answering (QA) tasks require models that can reason across long text and source tables, traversing multiple hops and executing complex operations such as aggregation. Yet existing benchmarks are small, manually curated - and therefore error-prone - and contain shallow questions that seldom demand more than two hops or invoke aggregations, grouping, or other advanced analytical operations expressible in natural-language queries. We present SPARTA, an end-to-end construction framework that automatically generates large-scale Table-Text QA benchmarks with lightweight human validation, requiring only one quarter of the annotation time of HybridQA. The framework first constructs a reference fact database by enriching each source table with grounding tables whose tuples are atomic facts automatically extracted from the accompanying unstructured passages, then synthesizes nested queries whose number of nested predicates matches the desired hop count. To ensure that every SQL statement is executable and that its verbalization yields a fluent, human-sounding question, we propose two novel techniques: provenance-based refinement, which rewrites any syntactically valid query that returns a non-empty result, and realistic-structure enforcement, which confines generation to post-order traversals of the query graph. The resulting pipeline produces thousands of high-fidelity question-answer pairs covering aggregations, grouping, and deep multi-hop reasoning across text and tables. On SPARTA, state-of-the-art models that reach over 70 F1 on HybridQA or over 50 F1 on OTT-QA drop by more than 30 F1 points, exposing fundamental weaknesses in current cross-modal reasoning.

Exact agreement reached 71.4% and remained unchanged under semantic similarity (t = 0.60), while structured cross-category and differential overlap analysis yielded 100% comprehensive concordance (95% CI: [83.9%, 100%]). No cases demonstrated complete diagnostic divergence. These findings show that binary lexical evaluation substantially un- derestimates clinically meaningful alignment. Modeling expert validation as a structured transformation enables signal-aware quantification of correction dynamics and supports traceable, human aligned evaluation of image based clinical decision support systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bca\u65ad\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u521d\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u66f4\u6b63\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u5f88\u5c11\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bca\u65ad\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u62a5\u544a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u53d8\u63a8\u7406\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u4e0e\u533b\u5e08\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u63a8\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eBERT\u7684\u533b\u7597\u5b9e\u4f53\u63d0\u53d6\u4ee5\u53ca\u987a\u5e8f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\uff08SLMI\uff09\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e00\u81f4\u7ec6\u5316\u3002\u572821\u4e2a\u76ae\u80a4\u79d1\u6848\u4f8b\uff0821\u5bf9\u5b8c\u6574\u7684AI\u533b\u5e08\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u7b26\u5408\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5339\u914d\u7387\uff08PMR\uff09\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\u7387\uff08AMR\uff09\u3001\u8de8\u7c7b\u522b\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u7efc\u5408\u7b26\u5408\u7387\uff08CCR\uff09\u3002\u7cbe\u786e\u7b26\u5408\u7387\u8fbe\u523071.4%\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\uff08t = 0.60\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8de8\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u5dee\u5f02\u91cd\u53e0\u5206\u6790\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86100%\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u7b26\u5408\u7387\uff0895% CI\uff1a[83.9%\uff0c100%]\uff09\u3002\u6ca1\u6709\u6848\u4f8b\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e8c\u5143\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u5927\u4f4e\u4f30\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u5c06\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u66f4\u6b63\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u611f\u77e5\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u3001\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose persistent nonnegative matrix factorization (pNMF), a scale-parameterized family of NMF problems, that produces a sequence of persistence-aligned embeddings rather than a single one. By leveraging persistent homology, we identify a canonical minimal sufficient scale set at which the underlying connectivity undergoes qualitative changes. These canonical scales induce a sequence of graph Laplacians, leading to a coupled NMF formulation with scale-wise geometric regularization and explicit cross-scale consistency constraint. We analyze the structural properties of the embeddings along the scale parameter and establish bounds on their increments between consecutive scales. The resulting model defines a nontrivial solution path across scales, rather than a single factorization, which poses new computational challenges.

To enable systematic evaluation for natural images, we construct ImageNet-S, a benchmark that provides paired image-label factual retrieval tasks. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-S demonstrate that our method exhibits promising retrieval and reconstruction performance while remaining fully compatible with diverse watermarking pipelines. This framework establishes a foundation for general-purpose image recovery beyond detection and localization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u85cf\u4ee3\u7801\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u50cf\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0a\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u7be1\u6539\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u6062\u590d\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u4ee3\u7801\u6062\u590d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u4e8b\u540e\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6c34\u5370\u8303\u5f0f\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u6062\u590d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u77e2\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u606f\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u4ee3\u7801\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6Transformer\u6a21\u5757\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u4f7f\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86ImageNet-S\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u914d\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf-\u6807\u7b7e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet-S\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u7ba1\u9053\u5b8c\u5168\u517c\u5bb9\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u56fe\u50cf\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

That is, how people communicate about visual content by default omits tacit information needed to supervise some types of reasoning; e.g., \"at the game today!\" is a more likely caption than \"a photo of 37 people standing behind a field\". We investigate the data underlying the popular VLMs OpenCLIP, LLaVA-1.5 and Molmo through the lens of theories from pragmatics, and find that reporting bias results in insufficient representation of four reasoning skills (spatial, temporal, negation, and counting), despite the corpora being of web-scale, and/or synthetically generated. With a set of curated benchmarks, we demonstrate that: (i) VLMs perform poorly on the aforementioned types of reasoning suppressed in the training data by reporting bias; (ii) contrary to popular belief, scaling data size, model size, and to multiple languages does not result in emergence of these skills by default; but, promisingly, (iii) incorporating annotations specifically collected to obtain tacit information is effective.

We propose TrajTok, an end-to-end video tokenizer module that is fully integrated and co-trained with video models for a downstream objective, dynamically adapting its token granularity to semantic complexity, independent of video duration. TrajTok contains a unified segmenter that performs implicit clustering over pixels in both space and time to directly produce object trajectories in a single forward pass. By prioritizing downstream adaptability over pixel-perfect segmentation fidelity, TrajTok is lightweight and efficient, yet empirically improves video understanding performance. With TrajTok, we implement a video CLIP model trained from scratch (TrajViT2).

However, we also demonstrate that naive merges are fragile because they overlook the output format mismatch between LRMs (with explicit thinking and response segments) and ITMs (answers-only). We introduce RAIN-Merging (Reasoning-Aware Instruction-attention guided Null-space projection Merging), a gradient-free method that integrates instruction following while preserving thinking format and reasoning performance. First, with a small reasoning calibration set, we project the ITM task vector onto the null space of forward features at thinking special tokens, which preserves the LRM's structured reasoning mechanisms. Second, using a small instruction calibration set, we estimate instruction attention to derive module-specific scaling that amplifies instruction-relevant components and suppresses leakage.

This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach for multi-agent race strategy optimization. Agents learn to balance energy management, tire degradation, aerodynamic interaction, and pit-stop decisions.

While existing methods generate part-level 3D objects, they often fail to organize these parts into distinct instances in open-world scenes. Through a debiased clustering probe, we reveal a critical insight: this failure stems from the lack of structural constraints within the model's internal assignment mechanism. Based on this finding, we reframe the task of structured 3D scene generation as a global correlation assignment problem. To solve this, SceneTransporter formulates and solves an entropic Optimal Transport (OT) objective within the denoising loop of the compositional DiT model. This formulation imposes two powerful structural constraints. First, the resulting transport plan gates cross-attention to enforce an exclusive, one-to-one routing of image patches to part-level 3D latents, preventing entanglement. Second, the competitive nature of the transport encourages the grouping of similar patches, a process that is further regularized by an edge-based cost, to form coherent objects and prevent fragmentation. Extensive experiments show that SceneTransporter outperforms existing methods on open-world scene generation, significantly improving instance-level coherence and geometric fidelity.

Relational Deep Learning (RDL) methods automate feature engineering via message passing, while classical approaches like Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS) rely on predefined non-parametric aggregators. Despite performance gains, the comparative advantages of RDL over DFS and the design principles for selecting effective architectures remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive study that unifies RDL and DFS in a shared design space and conducts architecture-centric searches across diverse RDB tasks. Our analysis yields three key findings: (1) RDL does not consistently outperform DFS, with performance being highly task-dependent; (2) no single architecture dominates across tasks, underscoring the need for task-aware model selection; and (3) validation accuracy is an unreliable guide for architecture choice. This search yields a model performance bank that links architecture configurations to their performance; leveraging this bank, we analyze the drivers of the RDL-DFS performance gap and introduce two task signals -- RDB task homophily and an affinity embedding that captures size, path, feature, and temporal structure -- whose correlation with the gap enables principled routing. Guided by these signals, we propose Relatron, a task embedding-based meta-selector that chooses between RDL and DFS and prunes the within-family search. Lightweight loss-landscape metrics further guard against brittle checkpoints by preferring flatter optima.

Extensive experiments across 8 languages and multiple model families (Llama-3, Qwen-2.5) demonstrate that our method substantially reduces Attack Success Rate (ASR) in LRLs with negligible impact on general reasoning capabilities, all achieved with a single, data-efficient calculation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u6743\u91cd\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5176\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "Large Language Models\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08LRLs\uff09\u5f80\u5f80\u7ed5\u8fc7\u4e86\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08HRLs\uff09\u5982\u82f1\u8bed\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5982\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RLHF\uff09\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b89\u5168\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u6743\u91cd\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8bc6\u522b\u5230\u5b89\u5168\u80fd\u529b\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u5b89\u5168\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u3002\u5bfc\u51fa\u5c01\u95ed\u5f62\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u5c06LRLs\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u8868\u793a\u6620\u5c04\u5230HRLs\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5b89\u5168\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u6295\u5f71\u7ea6\u675f\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\uff08Llama-3\uff0cQwen-2.5\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86LRLs\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff08ASR\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90fd\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5176\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for atmospheric turbulence mitigation, GSTurb, which integrates optical flow-guided tilt correction and Gaussian splatting for modeling non-isoplanatic blur. The framework employs Gaussian parameters to represent tilt and blur, and optimizes them across multiple frames to enhance restoration. Experimental results on the ATSyn-static dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a peak PSNR of 27.67 dB and SSIM of 0.8735. Compared to the state-of-the-art method, GSTurb improves PSNR by 1.3 dB (a 4.5% increase) and SSIM by 0.048 (a 5.8% increase). Additionally, on real datasets, including the TSRWGAN Real-World and CLEAR datasets, GSTurb outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative performance. These results highlight that combining optical flow-guided tilt correction with Gaussian splatting effectively enhances image restoration under both synthetic and real-world turbulence conditions.

However, current approaches face significant challenges in bridging the modality gap between EEG and image data. These methods typically rely on complex adaptation processes involving multiple stages, making it hard to maintain consistency and manage compounding errors. Furthermore, the computational overhead imposed by large-scale diffusion models limit their practicality in real-world brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. In this work, we present AVDE, a lightweight and efficient framework for visual decoding from EEG signals. First, we leverage LaBraM, a pre-trained EEG model, and fine-tune it via contrastive learning to align EEG and image representations. Second, we adopt an autoregressive generative framework based on a \"next-scale prediction\" strategy: images are encoded into multi-scale token maps using a pre-trained VQ-VAE, and a transformer is trained to autoregressively predict finer-scale tokens starting from EEG embeddings as the coarsest representation. This design enables coherent generation while preserving a direct connection between the input EEG signals and the reconstructed images. Experiments on two datasets show that AVDE outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both image retrieval and reconstruction tasks, while using only 10% of the parameters. In addition, visualization of intermediate outputs shows that the generative process of AVDE reflects the hierarchical nature of human visual perception. These results highlight the potential of autoregressive models as efficient and interpretable tools for practical BCI applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7EEG\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6AVDE\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4eceEEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u89e3\u7801\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8eEEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u5a92\u4ecb\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u51b3EEG\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAVDE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4eceEEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u7801\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5229\u7528LaBraM\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684EEG\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50EEG\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u201c\u4e0b\u4e00\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u201d\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684VQ-VAE\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6807\u8bb0\u56fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2atransformer\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u56de\u5f52\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u4eceEEG\u5d4c\u5165\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAVDE\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u53ea\u670910%\u3002\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e2d\u95f4\u8f93\u51fa\u663e\u793a\uff0cAVDE\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "AVDE\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u5b9e\u7528BCI\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The Emotion Analysis Agent quantifies stimulus intensity using a 6-emotion BERT classifier, and the Emotion Adjustment Agent rewrites texts into two presentation modes, BALANCED (neutralized text) and COOL (neutralized text + supplementary text), using an LLM. The Balance Monitoring Agent aggregates weekly information consumption patterns and generates personalized advice, while the Personal Guide Agent recommends a presentation mode according to consumer sensitivity. Experiments on 800 AG News articles demonstrated significant stimulus score reduction (up to 19.3%) and improved emotion balance while maintaining semantic preservation. Near-zero correlation between stimulus reduction and semantic preservation confirmed that the two are independently controllable.

However, the quality of editing highly depends on carefully designed instructions, placing the burden of task decomposition and sequencing entirely on the user.

Specifically, PhotoAgent formulates autonomous image editing as a long-horizon decision-making problem. It reasons over user aesthetic intent, plans multi-step editing actions via tree search, and iteratively refines results through closed-loop execution with memory and visual feedback, without requiring step-by-step user prompts. To support reliable evaluation in real-world scenarios, we introduce UGC-Edit, an aesthetic evaluation benchmark consisting of 7,000 photos and a learned aesthetic reward model. We also construct a test set containing 1,017 photos to systematically assess autonomous photo editing performance.

Classical approaches achieve such generalization through symbolic abstractions and explicit reasoning over $\u03b3$. In contrast, recent Transformer-based planners, such as PlanGPT and Plansformer, largely cast generalized planning as direct action-sequence prediction, bypassing explicit transition modeling. While effective on in-distribution instances, these approaches typically require large datasets and model sizes, and often suffer from state drift in long-horizon settings due to the absence of explicit world-state evolution. In this work, we formulate generalized planning as a transition-model learning problem, in which a neural model explicitly approximates the successor-state function $\\hat\u03b3 \\approx \u03b3$ and generates plans by rolling out symbolic state trajectories. Instead of predicting actions directly, the model autoregressively predicts intermediate world states, thereby learning the domain dynamics as an implicit world model. To study size-invariant generalization and sample efficiency, we systematically evaluate multiple state representations and neural architectures, including relational graph encodings. Our results show that learning explicit transition models yields higher out-of-distribution satisficing-plan success than direct action-sequence prediction in multiple domains, while achieving these gains with significantly fewer training instances and smaller models.

However, existing works relying on numerical age representations overlook the interplay of biological and contextual cues. Despite progress in recent face aging models, they struggle with identity preservation in wide age transformations, also static attention and optimization-heavy inversion in diffusion limit adaptability, fine-grained control and background consistency. To address these challenges, we propose Face Time Traveller (FaceTT), a diffusion-based framework that achieves high-fidelity, identity-consistent age transformation. Here, we introduce a Face-Attribute-Aware Prompt Refinement strategy that encodes intrinsic (biological) and extrinsic (environmental) aging cues for context-aware conditioning. A tuning-free Angular Inversion method is proposed that efficiently maps real faces into the diffusion latent space for fast and accurate reconstruction. Moreover, an Adaptive Attention Control mechanism is introduced that dynamically balances cross-attention for semantic aging cues and self-attention for structural and identity preservation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and in-the-wild testset demonstrate that FaceTT achieves superior identity retention, background preservation and aging realism over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "FaceTT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u7559\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u8870\u8001\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5a31\u4e50\u3001\u6cd5\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5f52\u6863\u7b49\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u9762\u90e8\u8870\u8001\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u73af\u5883\u548c\u9057\u4f20\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u4e0d\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bf9\u903c\u771f\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u8f6c\u6362\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u4fdd\u7559\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6570\u503c\u5e74\u9f84\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u8870\u8001\u6a21\u578b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u8f6c\u6362\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u9006\u6269\u6563\u5728\u6269\u6563\u9650\u5236\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Face Time Traveller\uff08FaceTT\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u8f6c\u6362\u3002\u8fd9\u91cc\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eFace-Attribute-Aware\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7ec6\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u5185\u5728\uff08\u751f\u7269\uff09\u548c\u5916\u5728\uff08\u73af\u5883\uff09\u7684\u8870\u8001\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8c03\u6574\u7684Angular Inversion\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u9762\u5b54\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6269\u6563\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u8870\u8001\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u53ca\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u7559\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u91ce\u5916\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFaceTT\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u7559\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u8870\u8001\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FaceTT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u7559\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u8870\u8001\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, existing fairness interventions often as- sume unconstrained resources and employ group-specific decision thresholds that violate anti- discrimination regulations. We introduce a post-hoc, model-agnostic threshold optimization framework that jointly balances safety, efficiency, and equity under strict and hard capacity constraints. To ensure legal compliance, the framework enforces a single, global decision thresh- old. We formulated a parameterized ethical loss function coupled with a bounded decision rule that mathematically prevents intervention volumes from exceeding the available resources. An- alytically, we prove the key properties of the deployed threshold, including local monotonicity with respect to ethical weighting and the formal identification of critical capacity regimes. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations on diverse high-stakes datasets. The principal re- sults demonstrate that capacity constraints dominate ethical priorities; the strict resource limit determines the final deployed threshold in over 80% of the tested configurations. Furthermore, under a restrictive 25% capacity limit, the proposed framework successfully maintains high risk identification (recall ranging from 0.409 to 0.702), whereas standard unconstrained fairness heuristics collapse to a near-zero utility. We conclude that theoretical fairness objectives must be explicitly subordinated to operational capacity limits to remain in deployment. By decou- pling predictive scoring from policy evaluation and strictly bounding intervention rates, this framework provides a practical and legally compliant mechanism for stakeholders to navigate unavoidable ethical trade-offs in resource-constrained environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e73\u8861\u9884\u6d4b\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u9608\u503c\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u9886\u57df\u90e8\u7f72\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u65e0\u9650\u5236\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u8fd9\u8fdd\u53cd\u4e86\u53cd\u6b67\u89c6\u6cd5\u89c4\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540e\u5904\u7406\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9608\u503c\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u548c\u786c\u5bb9\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u540c\u65f6\u5e73\u8861\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u786e\u4fdd\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5408\u89c4\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u3001\u5168\u5c40\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u9608\u503c\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5236\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u754c\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4ece\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u9632\u6b62\u5e72\u9884\u91cf\u8d85\u8fc7\u53ef\u7528\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u6700\u7ec8\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u9608\u503c\uff1b\u5728\u8d85\u8fc780%\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u6700\u7ec8\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u9608\u503c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u572825%\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u7ef4\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8bc6\u522b\uff08\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4ece0.409\u52300.702\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u516c\u5e73\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u81f3\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e3a\u96f6\u7684\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u5fc5\u987b\u660e\u786e\u5730\u4ece\u5c5e\u4e8e\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u653f\u7b56\u8bc4\u4f30\u89e3\u8026\u5e76\u4e25\u683c\u9650\u5236\u5e72\u9884\u7387\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u4e14\u5408\u6cd5\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

Recent advancements represented by video generation models like Sora have demonstrated the potential of data-driven scaling laws to approximate physical dynamics, while the emerging Unified Multimodal Model (UMM) offers a promising architectural paradigm for integrating perception, language, and reasoning. Despite these advances, the field still lacks a principled theoretical framework that defines the essential properties requisite for a General World Model. In this paper, we propose that a World Model must be grounded in the Trinity of Consistency: Modal Consistency as the semantic interface, Spatial Consistency as the geometric basis, and Temporal Consistency as the causal engine. Through this tripartite lens, we systematically review the evolution of multimodal learning, revealing a trajectory from loosely coupled specialized modules toward unified architectures that enable the synergistic emergence of internal world simulators.

However, VPS remains challenging because polyps often look similar to surrounding mucosa, leading to weak semantic discrimination. In addition, large changes in polyp position and scale across video frames make stable and accurate segmentation difficult. To address these challenges, we propose a robust VPS framework named CMSA-Net. The proposed network introduces a Causal Multi-scale Aggregation (CMA) module to effectively gather semantic information from multiple historical frames at different scales. By using causal attention, CMA ensures that temporal feature propagation follows strict time order, which helps reduce noise and improve feature reliability. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Multi-source Reference (DMR) strategy that adaptively selects informative and reliable reference frames based on semantic separability and prediction confidence. This strategy provides strong multi-frame guidance while keeping the model efficient for real-time inference.

Existing block-granularity sparsification can reduce latency, but coarse blocks impose an intrinsic sparsity ceiling, making further improvements difficult even with carefully engineered designs. We present S2O, which performs early stopping for sparse attention via online permutation. Inspired by virtual-to-physical address mapping in memory systems, S2O revisits and factorizes FlashAttention execution, enabling inference to load non-contiguous tokens rather than a contiguous span in the original order. Motivated by fine-grained structures in attention heatmaps, we transform explicit permutation into an online, index-guided, discrete loading policy; with extremely lightweight preprocessing and index-remapping overhead, it concentrates importance on a small set of high-priority blocks. Building on this importance-guided online permutation for loading, S2O further introduces an early-stopping rule: computation proceeds from high to low importance; once the current block score falls below a threshold, S2O terminates early and skips the remaining low-contribution blocks, thereby increasing effective sparsity and reducing computation under a controlled error budget.\n  As a result, S2O substantially raises the practical sparsity ceiling. On Llama-3.1-8B under a 128K context, S2O reduces single-operator MSE by 3.82$\\times$ at matched sparsity, and reduces prefill compute density by 3.31$\\times$ at matched MSE; meanwhile, it preserves end-to-end accuracy and achieves 7.51$\\times$ attention and 3.81$\\times$ end-to-end speedups.", "AI": {"tldr": "S2O\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u505c\u6b62\u6280\u672f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "S2O\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u6392\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u65e9\u671f\u505c\u6b62\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u505c\u6b62\u89c4\u5219\uff1a\u4ece\u9ad8\u5230\u4f4e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b\u4e00\u65e6\u5f53\u524d\u5757\u5f97\u5206\u4f4e\u4e8e\u9608\u503c\uff0cS2O\u5c06\u63d0\u524d\u7ec8\u6b62\u5e76\u8df3\u8fc7\u5269\u4f59\u7684\u4f4e\u8d21\u732e\u5757\u3002", "result": "S2O\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "S2O\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0a\u9650\u3002\u5728Llama-3.1-8B\u7684128K\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\uff0cS2O\u5728\u5339\u914d\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5c06\u5355\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26MSE\u964d\u4f4e\u4e863.82\u500d\uff0c\u5728\u5339\u914dMSE\u4e0b\u5c06\u9884\u586b\u5145\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e863.31\u500d\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e867.51\u500d\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c3.81\u500d\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u52a0\u901f\u3002"}}

Yet texture is still typically determined by slow and labour intensive laboratory particle size tests, while many sensing alternatives are either costly or too coarse to support routine field scale deployment. This paper proposes a robust and field deployable multispectral imaging (MSI) system and machine learning framework for predicting soil composition and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) texture classes. The proposed system uses a cost effective in-house MSI device operating from 365 nm to 940 nm to capture thirteen spectral bands, which effectively capture the spectral properties of soil texture. Regression models use the captured spectral properties to estimate clay, silt, and sand percentages, while a direct classifier predicts one of the twelve USDA textural classes. Indirect classification is obtained by mapping the regressed compositions to texture classes via the USDA soil texture triangle. The framework is evaluated on mixture data by mixing clay, silt, and sand in varying proportions, using the USDA classification triangle as a basis. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a coefficient of determination R^2 up to 0.99 for composition prediction and over 99% accuracy for texture classification.

However, this strategy faces two critical challenges: large-scale medical datasets often contain substantial redundancy and severe class imbalance that bias representation learning toward over-represented patterns, and indiscriminate training regardless of heterogeneity in data quality incurs considerable computational inefficiency. Here we demonstrate that active, principled data curation during pretraining can serve as a viable, cost-effective alternative to brute-force dataset enlargement. We introduce CheXficient, a chest X-ray (CXR) foundation model that selectively prioritizes informative training samples. CheXficient is pretrained on only 22.7% of 1,235,004 paired CXR images and reports while consuming under 27.3% of the total compute budget, yet achieving comparable or superior performance to its full-data counterpart and other large-scale pretrained models. We assess CheXficient across 20 individual benchmarks spanning 5 task types, including non-adapted off-the-shelf evaluations (zero-shot findings classification and crossmodal retrieval) and adapted downstream tasks (disease prediction, semantic segmentation, and radiology report generation). Further analyses show that CheXficient systematically prioritizes under-represented training samples, improving generalizability on long-tailed or rare conditions.

However, real-world tabular datasets increasingly contain free-form text fields (e.g., reviews or clinical notes) alongside structured numerical and categorical attributes. Generating such heterogeneous tables with joint modeling of different modalities remains challenging. Existing approaches broadly fall into two categories: diffusion-based methods and LLM-based methods. Diffusion models can capture complex dependencies over numerical and categorical features in continuous or discrete spaces, but extending them to open-ended text is nontrivial and often leads to degraded text quality. In contrast, LLM-based generators naturally produce fluent text, yet their discrete tokenization can distort precise or wide-range numerical values, hindering accurate modeling of both numbers and language. In this work, we propose TabDLM, a unified framework for free-form tabular data generation via a joint numerical--language diffusion model built on masked diffusion language models (MDLMs). TabDLM models textual and categorical features through masked diffusion, while modeling numerical features with a continuous diffusion process through learned specialized numeric tokens embedding; bidirectional attention then captures cross-modality interactions within a single model. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TabDLM compared to strong diffusion- and LLM-based baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing methods still fail to achieve satisfactory accuracy and scalability. In this work, we identify a parameter democratization effect as a key bottleneck: the sensitivity of all parameters becomes homogenized, severely limiting expressivity. To address this, we propose pQuant, a method that decouples parameters by splitting linear layers into two specialized branches: a dominant 1-bit branch for efficient computation and a compact high-precision branch dedicated to preserving the most sensitive parameters.

In single-cell biology, however, evaluation practices for both general and specialized LLMs remain inadequate: existing benchmarks are fragmented across tasks, adopt formats such as multiple-choice classification that diverge from real-world usage, and rely on metrics lacking interpretability and biological grounding. We present SC-ARENA, a natural language evaluation framework tailored to single-cell foundation models. SC-ARENA formalizes a virtual cell abstraction that unifies evaluation targets by representing both intrinsic attributes and gene-level interactions. Within this paradigm, we define five natural language tasks (cell type annotation, captioning, generation, perturbation prediction, and scientific QA) that probe core reasoning capabilities in cellular biology. To overcome the limitations of brittle string-matching metrics, we introduce knowledge-augmented evaluation, which incorporates external ontologies, marker databases, and scientific literature to support biologically faithful and interpretable judgments. Experiments and analysis across both general-purpose and domain-specialized LLMs demonstrate that (i) under the Virtual Cell unified evaluation paradigm, current models achieve uneven performance on biologically complex tasks, particularly those demanding mechanistic or causal understanding; and (ii) our knowledge-augmented evaluation framework ensures biological correctness, provides interpretable, evidence-grounded rationales, and achieves high discriminative capacity, overcoming the brittleness and opacity of conventional metrics.

However, real-world captures often deviate from this canonical orientation due to unconstrained camera motions, such as the rotational jitter of handheld devices or the dynamic attitude shifts of aerial platforms. This discrepancy causes standard spherical Transformers to overfit global latitude cues, leading to performance collapse under 3D reorientations. To address this, we introduce SO3UFormer, a rotation-robust architecture designed to learn intrinsic spherical features that are less sensitive to the underlying coordinate frame. Our approach rests on three geometric pillars: (1) an intrinsic feature formulation that decouples the representation from the gravity vector by removing absolute latitude encoding; (2) quadrature-consistent spherical attention that accounts for non-uniform sampling densities; and (3) a gauge-aware relative positional mechanism that encodes local angular geometry using tangent-plane projected angles and discrete gauge pooling, avoiding reliance on global axes. We further use index-based spherical resampling together with a logit-level SO(3)-consistency regularizer during training. To rigorously benchmark robustness, we introduce Pose35, a dataset variant of Stanford2D3D perturbed by random rotations within $\\pm 35^\\circ$. Under the extreme test of arbitrary full SO(3) rotations, existing SOTAs fail catastrophically: the baseline SphereUFormer drops from 67.53 mIoU to 25.26 mIoU.

This work extracts algorithmic cores: compact subspaces necessary and sufficient for task performance. Independently trained transformers learn different weights but converge to the same cores. Markov-chain transformers embed 3D cores in nearly orthogonal subspaces yet recover identical transition spectra. Modular-addition transformers discover compact cyclic operators at grokking that later inflate, yielding a predictive model of the memorization-to-generalization transition. GPT-2 language models govern subject-verb agreement through a single axis that, when flipped, inverts grammatical number throughout generation across scales.

Specifically, to enhance Identifiability, we provide the reward model with full reference solutions as context, enabling fine-grained process verification to filter out false positives (samples with the right answer but low-quality reasoning process). To improve Reachability, we introduce a multi-turn sampling strategy where the reward model generates mistake reports for failed attempts, guiding the policy to \"recover\" correct responses from previously all-negative groups. Experimental results on 11 perception and reasoning benchmarks show that ContextRL significantly improves knowledge discovery efficiency.

While recent continual learning studies have made progress in addressing catastrophic forgetting, the problem of fairness caused the imbalanced data remains largely underexplored. This paper presents a novel Fairness Direct Preference Optimization (FaiDPO or $\u03c6$-DPO) framework for continual learning in LMMs. In particular, we first propose a new continual learning paradigm based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by aligning learning with pairwise preference signals. Then, we identify the limitations of conventional DPO in imbalanced data and present a new $\u03c6$-DPO loss that explicitly addresses distributional biases. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis demonstrating that our approach addresses both forgetting and data imbalance. Additionally, to enable $\u03c6$-DPO-based continual learning, we construct pairwise preference annotations for existing benchmarks in the context of continual learning. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show the proposed $\u03c6$-DPO achieves State-of-the-Art performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming prior continual learning methods of LMMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u03c6-DPO\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LMM\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6210\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edfDPO\u5728\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u03c6-DPO\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u660e\u786e\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u03c6-DPO\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6210\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u6ce8\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u03c6-DPO\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684LMM\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u03c6-DPO\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3LMM\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In deployment, however, prompts routinely include contextual signals such as user requests, cues on social norms, etc. that may steer decisions. We study how directed contextual influences reshape decisions in trolley-problem-style moral triage settings. We introduce a pilot evaluation harness for directed contextual influence in trolley-problem-style moral triage: for each demographic factor, we apply matched, direction-flipped contextual influences that differ only in which group they favor, enabling systematic measurement of directional response. We find that: (i) contextual influences often significantly shift decisions, even when only superficially relevant; (ii) baseline preferences are a poor predictor of directional steerability, as models can appear baseline-neutral yet exhibit systematic steerability asymmetry under influence; (iii) influences can backfire: models may explicitly claim neutrality or discount the contextual cue, yet their choices still shift, sometimes in the opposite direction; and (iv) reasoning reduces average sensitivity, but amplifies the effect of biased few-shot examples.

Under journal review", "summary": "AI systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes contexts -- medical diagnosis, legal research, financial analysis -- under the assumption they can be governed by norms. This paper demonstrates that assumption is formally invalid for optimization-based systems, specifically Large Language Models trained via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We establish that genuine agency requires two necessary and jointly sufficient architectural conditions: the capacity to maintain certain boundaries as non-negotiable constraints rather than tradeable weights (Incommensurability), and a non-inferential mechanism capable of suspending processing when those boundaries are threatened (Apophatic Responsiveness). These conditions apply across all normative domains.\n  RLHF-based systems are constitutively incompatible with both conditions. The operations that make optimization powerful -- unifying all values on a scalar metric and always selecting the highest-scoring output -- are precisely the operations that preclude normative governance. This incompatibility is not a correctable training bug awaiting a technical fix; it is a formal constraint inherent to what optimization is. Consequently, documented failure modes - sycophancy, hallucination, and unfaithful reasoning - are not accidents but structural manifestations.\n  Misaligned deployment triggers a second-order risk we term the Convergence Crisis: when humans are forced to verify AI outputs under metric pressure, they degrade from genuine agents into criteria-checking optimizers, eliminating the only component in the system capable of normative accountability.

Code will be released after review", "summary": "A clinically actionable Cardiac Digital Twin (CDT) should reconstruct individualised cardiac anatomy and physiology, update its internal state from multimodal signals, and enable a broad range of downstream simulations beyond isolated tasks. However, existing CDT frameworks remain limited to task-specific predictors rather than building a patient-specific, manipulable virtual heart. In this work, we introduce Chain of Flow (COF), a foundational ECG-driven generative framework that reconstructs full 4D cardiac structure and motion from a single cardiac cycle. The method integrates cine-CMR and 12-lead ECG during training to learn a unified representation of cardiac geometry, electrophysiology, and motion dynamics. We evaluate Chain of Flow on diverse cohorts and demonstrate accurate recovery of cardiac anatomy, chamber-wise function, and dynamic motion patterns.

While photorealistic simulators offer a solution, they often struggle with the ``sim-to-real\" gap; conversely, simple image-masking techniques lack the spatio-temporal coherence required to obtain augmented single- and multi-frame scenes with the correct appearance and dimensions. This paper introduces a multi-modal augmented reality framework designed to bridge this gap by integrating photorealistic virtual objects into real-world railway sequences from the OSDaR23 dataset.

This paper also proposes a segmentation-based refinement strategy for INS/GNSS data to significantly improve the realism of the augmented sequences, as confirmed by the comparative study presented in the paper.

This paper introduces Layer-wise MIA-risk-aware DP-SGD (LM-DP-SGD), which adaptively allocates privacy protection across layers in proportion to their MIA risk. Specifically, LM-DP-SGD trains a shadow model on a public shadow dataset, extracts per-layer IRs from its train/test splits, and fits layer-specific MIA adversaries, using their attack error rates as MIA-risk estimates. Leveraging the cross-dataset transferability of MIAs, these estimates are then used to reweight each layer's contribution to the globally clipped gradient during private training, providing layer-appropriate protection under a fixed noise magnitude. We further establish theoretical guarantees on both privacy and convergence of LM-DP-SGD.

To accommodate this new objective of translation, we formulate a decoupled prover-verifier game where the equilibria correspond to faithful and checkable translators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u8026\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u68c0\u67e5\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u68c0\u67e5\u6027\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6b63\u786e\u6027", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u68c0\u67e5\u6027", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u68c0\u67e5\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u201c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5668\u201d\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u6c42\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53ef\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f", "result": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u68c0\u67e5\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u201c\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u7a0e\u201d\u73b0\u8c61", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u68c0\u67e5\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u68c0\u67e5\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027"}}

To this end, we present WaterVideoQA, the first large-scale, comprehensive Video Question Answering benchmark specifically engineered for all-waterway environments.

While predictive, these laws are descriptive rather than prescriptive: they characterize typical training, not optimal training. Surprisingly few works have successfully challenged the data-efficiency bounds implied by these laws -- which is our primary focus. To that end, we introduce the Geodesic Hypothesis, positing that token sequences trace geodesics on a smooth semantic manifold and are therefore locally linear. Building on this principle, we propose a novel Semantic Tube Prediction (STP) task, a JEPA-style regularizer that confines hidden-state trajectories to a tubular neighborhood of the geodesic. STP generalizes JEPA to language without requiring explicit multi-view augmentations. We show this constraint improves signal-to-noise ratio, and consequently preserves diversity by preventing trajectory collisions during inference. Empirically, STP allows LLMs to match baseline accuracy with 16$\\times$ less training data on the NL-RX-SYNTH dataset, directly violating the data term of Chinchilla-style scaling laws and demonstrating that principled geometric priors can surpass brute-force scaling.

Current solutions often resort to rigid structural engineering or expensive fine-tuning, limiting their deployability and adaptability. We propose AgentDropoutV2, a test-time rectify-or-reject pruning framework designed to dynamically optimize MAS information flow without retraining. Our approach acts as an active firewall, intercepting agent outputs and employing a retrieval-augmented rectifier to iteratively correct errors based on a failure-driven indicator pool. This mechanism allows for the precise identification of potential errors using distilled failure patterns as prior knowledge. Irreparable outputs are subsequently pruned to prevent error propagation, while a fallback strategy preserves system integrity. Empirical results on extensive math benchmarks show that AgentDropoutV2 significantly boosts the MAS's task performance, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.3 percentage points on math benchmarks.

Typically, prompt tuning techniques have harnessed knowledge from a single pre-trained model, whether from a general or a specialized medical domain. However, this approach typically overlooks the potential synergies that could arise from integrating diverse domain knowledge within the same tuning process. In this work, we propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts prompt tuning method called pMoE, which leverages the strengths of multiple expert domains through expert-specialized prompt tokens and the learnable dispatcher, effectively combining their expertise in a unified model framework. Our pMoE introduces expert-specific prompt tokens and utilizes a dynamic token dispatching mechanism at various prompt layers to optimize the contribution of each domain expert during the adaptation phase. By incorporating both domain knowledge from diverse experts, the proposed pMoE significantly enhances the model's versatility and applicability to a broad spectrum of tasks. We conduct extensive experiments across 47 adaptation tasks, including both classification and segmentation in general and medical domains.

However, most existing DP-FL approaches assume that all clients share a uniform privacy budget, an assumption that does not hold in real-world scenarios where privacy requirements vary widely. This privacy heterogeneity poses a significant challenge: conventional client selection strategies, which typically rely on data quantity, cannot distinguish between clients providing high-quality updates and those introducing substantial noise due to strict privacy constraints. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of privacy-aware client selection in DP-FL. We establish a theoretical foundation by deriving a convergence analysis that quantifies the impact of privacy heterogeneity on training error. Building on this analysis, we propose a privacy-aware client selection strategy, formulated as a convex optimization problem, that adaptively adjusts selection probabilities to minimize training error. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to a 10% improvement in test accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to existing baselines under heterogeneous privacy budgets.

While existing compression methods - ranging from self-training to Reinforcement Learning (RL) with length constraints - attempt to mitigate this, they often sacrifice reasoning capability for brevity. We identify a critical failure mode in these approaches: explicitly optimizing for shorter trajectories triggers rapid entropy collapse, which prematurely shrinks the exploration space and stifles the discovery of valid reasoning paths, particularly for challenging questions requiring extensive deduction. To address this issue, we propose Compress responses for Easy questions and Explore Hard ones (CEEH), a difficulty-aware approach to RL-based efficient reasoning.

This enables precise identification of parameter dynamics under varying token granularity levels, semantic scopes, and generation scales. Building on this analysis, we further uncover sparsity patterns along three critical dimensions-token, layer, and scale-and propose a set of fine-grained optimization strategies tailored to these patterns.

The issue of simplistic data alignment arises from the use of a straightforward unification for highly diverse graph data, which fails to align semantics and misleads pre-training models. The problem with limited training guidance lies in the arbitrary application of in-domain pre-training paradigms to cross-domain scenarios.

Automatic fingerspelling recognition plays a crucial role in bridging the communication gap between Deaf and hearing communities, yet it remains challenging due to the signing-hand ambiguity issue, the lack of appropriate training losses, and the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem. Prior fingerspelling recognition methods rely on explicit signing-hand detection, which often leads to recognition failures, and on a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss, which exhibits the peaky behavior problem. To address these issues, we develop OpenFS, an open-source approach for fingerspelling recognition and synthesis. We propose a multi-hand-capable fingerspelling recognizer that supports both single- and multi-hand inputs and performs implicit signing-hand detection by incorporating a dual-level positional encoding and a signing-hand focus (SF) loss. The SF loss encourages cross-attention to focus on the signing hand, enabling implicit signing-hand detection during recognition. Furthermore, without relying on the CTC loss, we introduce a monotonic alignment (MA) loss that enforces the output letter sequence to follow the temporal order of the input pose sequence through cross-attention regularization. In addition, we propose a frame-wise letter-conditioned generator that synthesizes realistic fingerspelling pose sequences for OOV words.

While the WHO Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) provides standardized surveillance data across 44 countries, few studies have applied machine learning to forecast population-level resistance trends from this data. This paper presents a two-component framework for AMR trend forecasting and evidence-grounded policy decision support. We benchmark six models -- Naive, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, and LSTM -- on 5,909 WHO GLASS observations across six WHO regions (2021-2023). XGBoost achieved the best performance with a test MAE of 7.07% and R-squared of 0.854, outperforming the naive baseline by 83.1%. Feature importance analysis identified the prior-year resistance rate as the dominant predictor (50.5% importance), while regional MAE ranged from 4.16% (European Region) to 10.14% (South-East Asia Region). We additionally implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline combining a ChromaDB vector store of WHO policy documents with a locally deployed Phi-3 Mini language model, producing source-attributed, hallucination-constrained policy answers.

To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-NeuroOnco, a large-scale multimodal benchmark and instruction-tuning dataset for brain tumor MRI understanding, consisting of 24,726 MRI slices from 20 data sources paired with approximately 200,000 semantically enriched multimodal instructions spanning diverse tumor subtypes and imaging modalities. To mitigate the scarcity and high cost of diagnostic semantic annotations, we develop a multi-model collaborative pipeline for automated medical information completion and quality control, enabling the generation of diagnosis-related semantics beyond mask-only annotations. Building upon this dataset, we further construct MM-NeuroOnco-Bench, a manually annotated evaluation benchmark with a rejection-aware setting to reduce biases inherent in closed-ended question formats. Evaluation across ten representative models shows that even the strongest baseline, Gemini 3 Flash, achieves only 41.88% accuracy on diagnosis-related questions, highlighting the substantial challenges of multimodal brain tumor diagnostic understanding. Leveraging MM-NeuroOnco, we further propose NeuroOnco-GPT, which achieves a 27% absolute accuracy improvement on diagnostic questions following fine-tuning. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of our dataset and benchmark in advancing clinically grounded multimodal diagnostic reasoning.

The optimization landscape is highly anisotropic, with loss reduction driven predominantly by progress along flat directions. While matrix-based optimizers such as Muon and SOAP leverage fine-grained curvature information to outperform AdamW, their updates tend toward isotropy -- relatively conservative along flat directions yet potentially aggressive along sharp ones. To address this limitation, we first establish a unified Riemannian Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) framework that elucidates how common adaptive algorithms operate synergistically: the preconditioner induces a Riemannian geometry that mitigates ill-conditioning, while momentum serves as a Riemannian damping term that promotes convergence. Guided by these insights, we propose LITE, a generalized acceleration strategy that enhances training dynamics by applying larger Hessian damping coefficients and learning rates along flat trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LITE significantly accelerates both Muon and SOAP across diverse architectures (Dense, MoE), parameter scales (130M--1.3B), datasets (C4, Pile), and learning-rate schedules (cosine, warmup-stable-decay). Theoretical analysis confirms that LITE facilitates faster convergence along flat directions in anisotropic landscapes, providing a principled approach to efficient LLM pre-training.

While mainstream approaches deploy multi-agent systems mimicking analyst and manager roles, they often rely on abstract instructions that overlook the intricacies of real-world workflows, which can lead to degraded inference performance and less transparent decision-making. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent LLM trading framework that explicitly decomposes investment analysis into fine-grained tasks, rather than providing coarse-grained instructions. We evaluate the proposed framework using Japanese stock data, including prices, financial statements, news, and macro information, under a leakage-controlled backtesting setting. Experimental results show that fine-grained task decomposition significantly improves risk-adjusted returns compared to conventional coarse-grained designs.

Alternative methods rely directly on previously generated frames without establishing explicit spatial correspondence, thereby constraining controllability and consistency. To address these limitations, we present UCM, a novel framework that unifies long-term memory and precise camera control via a time-aware positional encoding warping mechanism.

This design enables the isolated evaluation of geometric perception independently from reasoning. To exploit the data provided by GeoPerceive for enhancing the geometric perception capabilities of VLMs, we propose GeoDPO, a translator-guided reinforcement learning (RL) framework. GeoDPO employs an NL-to-DSL translator, which is trained on synthetic pairs generated by the data engine of GeoPerceive, to bridge natural language and DSL. This translator facilitates the computation of fine-grained, DSL-level scores, which serve as reward signals in reinforcement learning. We assess GeoDPO on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, spanning tasks in geometric perception as well as downstream reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers only marginal improvements and may even impair performance in out-of-domain scenarios, GeoDPO achieves substantial gains: $+26.5\\%$ on in-domain data, $+8.0\\%$ on out-of-domain data, and $+39.0\\%$ on downstream reasoning tasks.

DMAligner is crafted to tackle the challenges in image alignment from a new perspective, employing a generation-based solution that showcases strong capabilities and avoids the problems associated with flow-based image warping. Specifically, we propose a Dynamics-aware Diffusion Training approach for learning conditional image generation, synthesizing a novel view for image alignment. This incorporates a Dynamics-aware Mask Producing (DMP) module to adaptively distinguish dynamic foreground regions from static backgrounds, enabling the diffusion model to more effectively handle challenges that classical methods struggle to solve. Furthermore, we develop the Dynamic Scene Image Alignment (DSIA) dataset using Blender, which includes 1,033 indoor and outdoor scenes with over 30K image pairs tailored for image alignment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach on DSIA benchmarks, as well as on a series of widely-used video datasets for qualitative comparisons.

Distribution-based Representations of Epistemic Uncertainty: A Comparative Study", "comment": "29 pages", "summary": "Epistemic uncertainty in neural networks is commonly modeled using two second-order paradigms: distribution-based representations, which rely on posterior parameter distributions, and set-based representations based on credal sets (convex sets of probability distributions). These frameworks are often regarded as fundamentally non-comparable due to differing semantics, assumptions, and evaluation practices, leaving their relative merits unclear. Empirical comparisons are further confounded by variations in the underlying predictive models. To clarify this issue, we present a controlled comparative study enabling principled, like-for-like evaluation of the two paradigms. Both representations are constructed from the same finite collection of predictive distributions generated by a shared neural network, isolating representational effects from predictive accuracy. Our study evaluates each representation through the lens of 3 uncertainty measures across 8 benchmarks, including selective prediction and out-of-distribution detection, spanning 6 underlying predictive models and 10 independent runs per configuration. Our results show that meaningful comparison between these seemingly non-comparable frameworks is both feasible and informative, providing insights into how second-order representation choices impact practical uncertainty-aware performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u4e8c\u9636\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5b83\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u4e24\u79cd\u4e8c\u9636\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5e95\u5c42\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b83\u4eec\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f7f\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u3001\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u5bf9\u7b49\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u4ece\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6709\u9650\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u96c6\u5408\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u79cd\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u8868\u793a\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5206\u79bb\u3002\u901a\u8fc73\u4e2a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u57288\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d66\u4e2a\u5e95\u5c42\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u914d\u7f6e\u768410\u6b21\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u770b\u4f3c\u4e0d\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u6bd4\u8f83\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u5bcc\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u8868\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u4e8e\u5b83\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Existing methods typically convert the multimodal query into a single modality-either as an edited caption for Text-to-Image retrieval (T2I) or as an edited image for Image-to-Image retrieval (I2I). However, each paradigm has inherent limitations: T2I often loses fine-grained visual details, while I2I struggles with complex semantic modifications. To effectively leverage their complementary strengths under diverse query intents, we propose WISER, a training-free framework that unifies T2I and I2I via a \"retrieve-verify-refine\" pipeline, explicitly modeling intent awareness and uncertainty awareness. Specifically, WISER first performs Wider Search by generating both edited captions and images for parallel retrieval to broaden the candidate pool. Then, it conducts Adaptive Fusion with a verifier to assess retrieval confidence, triggering refinement for uncertain retrievals, and dynamically fusing the dual-path for reliable ones. For uncertain retrievals, WISER generates refinement suggestions through structured self-reflection to guide the next retrieval round toward Deeper Thinking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WISER significantly outperforms previous methods across multiple benchmarks, achieving relative improvements of 45% on CIRCO (mAP@5) and 57% on CIRR (Recall@1) over existing training-free methods. Notably, it even surpasses many training-dependent methods, highlighting its superiority and generalization under diverse scenarios.

Existing Gaussian Splatting based methods achieve high-quality reconstruction but break down on long sequences, temporal inconsistency, and fail under large motions and disocclusions. Moreover, their outputs are typically incompatible with conventional video coding pipelines, preventing practical applications.\n  We introduce PackUV, a novel 4D Gaussian representation that maps all Gaussian attributes into a sequence of structured, multi-scale UV atlas, enabling compact, image-native storage. To fit this representation from multi-view videos, we propose PackUV-GS, a temporally consistent fitting method that directly optimizes Gaussian parameters in the UV domain. A flow-guided Gaussian labeling and video keyframing module identifies dynamic Gaussians, stabilizes static regions, and preserves temporal coherence even under large motions and disocclusions. The resulting UV atlas format is the first unified volumetric video representation compatible with standard video codecs (e.g., FFV1) without losing quality, enabling efficient streaming within existing multimedia infrastructure.\n  To evaluate long-duration volumetric capture, we present PackUV-2B, the largest multi-view video dataset to date, featuring more than 50 synchronized cameras, substantial motion, and frequent disocclusions across 100 sequences and 2B (billion) frames.

We further introduce Geometric Reinforcement Learning for energy-based optimization, enabling stable multi-step planning in hyperbolic latent space. Extensive experiments on CrossTask and COIN demonstrate around 3% SR improvement in 3-step planning and 2% SR improvement in 4-step planning compared to the state-of-the-art V-JEPA 2.

We recognize that 4D datasets are far scarcer than 3D ones, which hampers the scalability of self-supervised 4D models. A promising alternative is to transfer 3D pre-trained models to 4D perception tasks. However, rigorous empirical analysis reveals two critical limitations that impede transfer capability: overfitting and the modality gap. To overcome these challenges, we develop a novel \"Align then Adapt\" (PointATA) paradigm that decomposes parameter-efficient transfer learning into two sequential stages. Optimal-transport theory is employed to quantify the distributional discrepancy between 3D and 4D datasets, enabling our proposed point align embedder to be trained in Stage 1 to alleviate the underlying modality gap. To mitigate overfitting, an efficient point-video adapter and a spatial-context encoder are integrated into the frozen 3D backbone to enhance temporal modeling capacity in Stage 2. Notably, with the above engineering-oriented designs, PointATA enables a pre-trained 3D model without temporal knowledge to reason about dynamic video content at a smaller parameter cost compared to previous work. Extensive experiments show that PointATA can match or even outperform strong full fine-tuning models, whilst enjoying the advantage of parameter efficiency, e.g. 97.21 \\% accuracy on 3D action recognition, $+8.7 \\%$ on 4 D action segmentation, and 84.06\\% on 4D semantic segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Conventional histograms or globally-decayed time-surface representations apply fixed temporal parameters across the entire image plane, which in practice creates a trade-off between preserving spatial structure during still periods and retaining sharp edges during rapid motion. We introduce Locally Adaptive Decay Surfaces (LADS), a family of event representations in which the temporal decay at each location is modulated according to local signal dynamics. Three strategies are explored, based on event rate, Laplacian-of-Gaussian response, and high-frequency spectral energy. These adaptive schemes preserve detail in quiescent regions while reducing blur in regions of dense activity. Extensive experiments on the public data show that LADS consistently improves both face detection and facial landmark accuracy compared to standard non-adaptive representations. At 30 Hz, LADS achieves higher detection accuracy and lower landmark error than either baseline, and at 240 Hz it mitigates the accuracy decline typically observed at higher frequencies, sustaining 2.44 % normalized mean error for landmarks and 0.966 mAP50 in face detection. These high-frequency results even surpass the accuracy reported in prior works operating at 30 Hz, setting new benchmarks for event-based face analysis. Moreover, by preserving spatial structure at the representation stage, LADS supports the use of much lighter network architectures while still retaining real-time performance. These results highlight the importance of context-aware temporal integration for neuromorphic vision and point toward real-time, high-frequency human-computer interaction systems that exploit the unique advantages of event cameras.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To this end, we propose SpectralMamba-UNet, a novel frequency-disentangled framework to decouple the learning of structural and textural information in the spectral domain. Our Spectral Decomposition and Modeling (SDM) module applies discrete cosine transform to decompose low- and high-frequency features, where low frequency contributes to global contextual modeling via a frequency-domain Mamba and high frequency preserves boundary-sensitive details.

Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge, we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire visual prototypes from historical images for inference. Since the model tends to favor compositions already stored in the queue during testing, we warm-start the queue by initializing it with training images for visual prototypes of seen compositions and generating unseen visual prototypes using the mapping learned between seen and unseen textual prototypes. Considering the semantic consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by multimodal collaborative representation learning. To provide a more reliable evaluation for CZSL, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, C-Fashion, and refine the widely used but noisy MIT-States dataset.

While SHAP explanations are routinely computed independently for each output coordinate, the theoretical necessity of this practice has remained unclear. By extending the classical Shapley axioms to vector-valued cooperative games, we establish a rigidity theorem showing that any attribution rule satisfying efficiency, symmetry, dummy player, and additivity must necessarily decompose component-wise across outputs.

Existing methods that recover the camera's heading under known rotation, whether from an IMU or an optimization algorithm, tend to perform well in low-noise, low-outlier conditions, but often decrease in accuracy or become computationally expensive as noise and outlier levels increase. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generalization of the Hough transform on the unit sphere (S(2)) to estimate the camera's heading. First, the method extracts correspondences between two frames and generates a great circle of directions compatible with each pair of correspondences. Then, by discretizing the unit sphere using a Fibonacci lattice as bin centers, each great circle casts votes for a range of directions, ensuring that features unaffected by noise or dynamic objects vote consistently for the correct motion direction. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is on the Pareto frontier of accuracy versus efficiency.

To ensure interpretability and enable reliable counterfactual analysis, the researchers adopted a tabular data approach rather than modeling temporal dependencies directly. Given the imbalance between fouling and non-fouling cases, the ADASYN oversampling technique was applied to improve minority class representation. Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM models were tested, achieving balanced performance with 77.6% sensitivity and 96.3% specificity at a 10% rebalancing rate. Results remained robust across different forecasting horizons. Notably, the tabular approach outperformed LSTM recurrent neural networks, suggesting that explicit temporal modeling was not necessary for strong predictive performance. Feature selection further reduced the model to five key variables, improving simplicity and interpretability with minimal loss of accuracy. A Shapley value-based counterfactual analysis was applied to the best-performing model, successfully identifying minimal input changes capable of reversing fouling predictions.

To rectify this gap, we have conducted an exhaustive review of hundreds of related works, organizing various transfer-based attacks into six distinct categories.

Existing noise-robust person Re-ID methods primarily rely on loss-correction or sample-selection strategies using softmax outputs. However, these methods suffer from two key limitations: 1) Softmax exhibits translation invariance, leading to over-confident and unreliable predictions on corrupted labels. 2) Conventional sample selection based on small-loss criteria often discards valuable hard positives that are crucial for learning discriminative features. To overcome these issues, we propose the CAlibration-to-REfinement (CARE) method, a two-stage framework that seeks certainty through probabilistic evidence propagation from calibration to refinement. In the calibration stage, we propose the probabilistic evidence calibration (PEC) that dismantles softmax translation invariance by injecting adaptive learnable parameters into the similarity function, and employs an evidential calibration loss to mitigate overconfidence on mislabeled samples. In the refinement stage, we design the evidence propagation refinement (EPR) that can more accurately distinguish between clean and noisy samples. Specifically, the EPR contains two steps: Firstly, the composite angular margin (CAM) metric is proposed to precisely distinguish clean but hard-to-learn positive samples from mislabeled ones in a hyperspherical space; Secondly, the certainty-oriented sphere weighting (COSW) is developed to dynamically allocate the importance of samples according to CAM, ensuring clean instances drive model updates.

To optimize training efficiency and model performance, this paper analyzes empirical scaling laws within this domain. We investigate the relationship between model performance (validation loss) and three key factors: model size ($N$), dataset size ($D$), and compute budget ($C$). Across a range of models, we find that Aurora exhibits the strongest data-scaling behavior: increasing the training dataset by 10x reduces validation loss by up to 3.2x. GraphCast demonstrates the highest parameter efficiency, yet suffers from limited hardware utilization. Our compute-optimal analysis indicates that, under fixed compute budgets, allocating resources to longer training durations yields greater performance gains than increasing model size.

While recent 2D LMMs have begun to eliminate such encoders for efficiency and scalability, extending this paradigm to 3D remains challenging due to the unordered and large-scale nature of point clouds. This leaves a critical unanswered question: How can we design an LMM that tokenizes unordered 3D data effectively and efficiently without a cumbersome encoder? We propose Fase3D, the first efficient encoder-free Fourier-based 3D scene LMM. Fase3D tackles the challenges of scalability and permutation invariance with a novel tokenizer that combines point cloud serialization and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to approximate self-attention. This design enables an effective and computationally minimal architecture, built upon three key innovations: First, we represent large scenes compactly via structured superpoints. Second, our space-filling curve serialization followed by an FFT enables efficient global context modeling and graph-based token merging. Lastly, our Fourier-augmented LoRA adapters inject global frequency-aware interactions into the LLMs at a negligible cost. Fase3D achieves performance comparable to encoder-based 3D LMMs while being significantly more efficient in computation and parameters.

We propose a physics-informed, latent relational framework to model cardiac vortices as interacting nodes in a graph. Our model combines a neural relational inference architecture with physics-inspired interaction energy and birth-death dynamics, yielding a latent graph sensitive to disease severity and intervention level. We first apply this to computational fluid dynamics simulations of aortic coarctation. Learned latent graphs reveal that as the aortic radius narrows, vortex interactions become stronger and more frequent. This leads to a higher graph entropy, correlating monotonically with coarctation severity ($R^2=0.78$, Spearman $|\u03c1|=0.96$).

Existing contrastive methods utilize augmentations that distort morphology, whereas generative approaches employ fixed-window segmentation, which misaligns cardiac cycles. To address these limitations, we propose RhythmBERT, a generative ECG language model that considers ECG as a language paradigm by encoding P, QRS, and T segments into symbolic tokens via autoencoder-based latent representations. These discrete tokens capture rhythm semantics, while complementary continuous embeddings retain fine-grained morphology, enabling a unified view of waveform structure and rhythm. RhythmBERT is pretrained on approximately 800,000 unlabeled ECG recordings with a masked prediction objective, allowing it to learn contextual representations in a label-efficient manner. Evaluations show that despite using only a single lead, RhythmBERT achieves comparable or superior performance to strong 12-lead baselines.

Most existing tracking-by-detection approaches assume static cameras or ignore physical consistency in motion modeling, leading to unreliable counting under dynamic conditions. We propose a physics-constrained tracking framework that unifies detection, appearance, and 3D motion reasoning in a real-time pipeline. Our approach integrates a transfer-learned YOLOv11m detector with EfficientNet-B0 appearance encoding within DeepSORT, while introducing a physics-constrained Kalman model (Phys-3D) that enforces physically plausible 3D motion dynamics through pinhole geometry. To address counting brittleness under occlusions, we implement a virtual counting band with persistence. On our platform benchmark, MOT-RailwayPlatformCrowdHead Dataset(MOT-RPCH), our method reduces counting error to 2.97%, demonstrating robust performance despite motion and occlusions.

We propose Principal-Random Subspace for LLM Activation Compression (PRAC), which novelly decomposes activations into two components: a principal subspace captured via SVD to retain dominant information, and a random subspace sampled from the orthogonal complement to approximate the tail.

To address this, we propose EmbodMocap, a portable and affordable data collection pipeline using two moving iPhones. Our key idea is to jointly calibrate dual RGB-D sequences to reconstruct both humans and scenes within a unified metric world coordinate frame. The proposed method allows metric-scale and scene-consistent capture in everyday environments without static cameras or markers, bridging human motion and scene geometry seamlessly. Compared with optical capture ground truth, we demonstrate that the dual-view setting exhibits a remarkable ability to mitigate depth ambiguity, achieving superior alignment and reconstruction performance over single iphone or monocular models. Based on the collected data, we empower three embodied AI tasks: monocular human-scene-reconstruction, where we fine-tune on feedforward models that output metric-scale, world-space aligned humans and scenes; physics-based character animation, where we prove our data could be used to scale human-object interaction skills and scene-aware motion tracking; and robot motion control, where we train a humanoid robot via sim-to-real RL to replicate human motions depicted in videos.

Critical to the effectiveness of these specialized embeddings in low-label regimes is a self-supervised pretraining objective we introduce: Temporal Contrastive Link Prediction (TCLP). The pretraining uses the full unlabeled interaction history to encode informative structural biases, enabling the model to learn role-specific representations without requiring annotated data.

Among ML models, matrix completion methods (MCMs) have proven effective in predicting thermophysical properties, including diffusion coefficients in binary mixtures. However, MCMs are restricted to single-temperature predictions, and their accuracy depends strongly on the availability of high-quality experimental data for each temperature of interest. In this work, we address this challenge by presenting a hybrid tensor completion method (TCM) for predicting temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in binary mixtures. The TCM employs a Tucker decomposition and is jointly trained on experimental data for diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in binary systems at 298 K, 313 K, and 333 K. Predictions from the semi-empirical SEGWE model serve as prior knowledge within a Bayesian training framework. The TCM then extrapolates linearly to any temperature between 268 K and 378 K, achieving markedly improved prediction accuracy compared to established models across all studied temperatures. To further enhance predictive performance, the experimental database was expanded using active learning (AL) strategies for targeted acquisition of new diffusion data by pulsed-field gradient (PFG) NMR measurements.

However, we identify a critical flaw in prevailing PnP solvers (e.g., based on HQS or Proximal Gradient): they function as memoryless operators, updating estimates solely based on instantaneous gradients. This lack of historical tracking inevitably leads to non-vanishing steady-state bias, where the reconstruction fails to strictly satisfy physical measurements under heavy corruption. To resolve this, we propose Dual-Coupled PnP Diffusion, which restores the classical dual variable to provide integral feedback, theoretically guaranteeing asymptotic convergence to the exact data manifold. However, this rigorous geometric coupling introduces a secondary challenge: the accumulated dual residuals exhibit spectrally colored, structured artifacts that violate the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) assumption of diffusion priors, causing severe hallucinations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Spectral Homogenization (SH), a frequency-domain adaptation mechanism that modulates these structured residuals into statistically compliant pseudo-AWGN inputs. This effectively aligns the solver's rigorous optimization trajectory with the denoiser's valid statistical manifold. Extensive experiments on CT and MRI reconstruction demonstrate that our approach resolves the bias-hallucination trade-off, achieving state-of-the-art fidelity with significantly accelerated convergence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684PnP\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u50cf\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684PnP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u8026\u5408PnP\u6269\u6563\u548c\u9891\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728CT\u548cMRI\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u504f\u5dee-\u5e7b\u89c9\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

It is unclear whether such meter-scale variability reflects irreducibly chaotic dynamics or contains a component predictable from surface characteristics and large-scale atmospheric forcing. Here we show that a substantial, physically coherent component of meter-scale near-surface weather is statistically recoverable from existing observations. By conditioning coarse atmospheric state on sparse surface station measurements and high-resolution Earth observation data, we infer spatially continuous fields of near-surface wind, temperature, and humidity at 10 m resolution across the contiguous United States. Relative to ERA5, the inferred fields reduce wind error by 29% and temperature and dewpoint error by 6%, while explaining substantially more spatial variance at fixed time steps. They also exhibit physically interpretable structure, including urban heat islands, evapotranspiration-driven humidity contrasts, and wind speed differences across land cover types. Our findings expand the frontier of weather modeling by demonstrating a computationally feasible approach to continental-scale meter-resolution inference. More broadly, they illustrate how conditioning coarse dynamical models on static fine-scale features can reveal previously unresolved components of the Earth system.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We argue that current computer vision task formulations are inherently constrained by matrix-based thinking: standard architectures rely on matrix-valued weights and vectorvalued biases, requiring structural flattening that restricts the space of naturally expressible tasks. GE-MLPs lift this constraint by operating with tensor-valued parameters, enabling explicit control over which dimensions are preserved or contracted without information loss. Through rigorous mathematical derivations, we demonstrate that classification, segmentation, and detection are special cases of MTL, differing only in their dimensional configuration within a formally defined task space. We further prove that this task space is strictly larger than what matrix-based formulations can natively express, enabling principled task configurations such as spatiotemporal or cross modal predictions that require destructive flattening under conventional approaches.

A rapidly growing frontier is the \\emph{Temporal Web3}: decentralized platforms whose behavior is recorded as immutable, time-stamped event streams. Despite the richness of this data, the field lacks shared, reproducible benchmarks that capture real-world temporal dynamics, specifically censoring and non-stationarity, across extended horizons. This absence slows methodological progress and limits the transfer of techniques between Web3 and broader Web domains. In this paper, we present the \\textit{FinSurvival Challenge 2025} as a case study in benchmarking \\emph{temporal Web3 intelligence}. Using 21.8 million transaction records from the Aave v3 protocol, the challenge operationalized 16 survival prediction tasks to model user behavior transitions.We detail the benchmark design and the winning solutions, highlighting how domain-aware temporal feature construction significantly outperformed generic modeling approaches. Furthermore, we distill lessons for next-generation temporal benchmarks, arguing that Web3 systems provide a high-fidelity sandbox for studying temporal challenges, such as churn, risk, and evolution that are fundamental to the wider Web.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7FinSurvival Challenge 2025\uff0c\u5229\u7528Aave v3\u534f\u8bae\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4Web3\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u6784\u5efa\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3Web3\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5171\u4eab\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6291\u5236\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FinSurvival Challenge 2025\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Aave v3\u534f\u8bae\u76842180\u4e07\u6761\u4ea4\u6613\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u5c0616\u4e2a\u751f\u5b58\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u8f6c\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u51c6\u5e76\u8be6\u7ec6\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u83b7\u80dc\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u6784\u5efa\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u65f6\u95f4\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6559\u8bad\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3aWeb3\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u65f6\u95f4\u6311\u6218\uff08\u5982\u7528\u6237\u6d41\u5931\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u6f14\u53d8\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6c99\u76d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7FinSurvival Challenge 2025\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4Web3\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u6784\u5efa\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u65f6\u95f4\u57fa\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u76ca\u7684\u6559\u8bad\u3002"}}

Previous experiments on Othello playing neural-networks test world-model learning but focus on a single game with a single set of rules. We introduce MetaOthello, a controlled suite of Othello variants with shared syntax but different rules or tokenizations, and train small GPTs on mixed-variant data to study how multiple world models are organized in a shared representation space. We find that transformers trained on mixed-game data do not partition their capacity into isolated sub-models; instead, they converge on a mostly shared board-state representation that transfers causally across variants. Linear probes trained on one variant can intervene on another's internal state with effectiveness approaching that of matched probes. For isomorphic games with token remapping, representations are equivalent up to a single orthogonal rotation that generalizes across layers. When rules partially overlap, early layers maintain game-agnostic representations while a middle layer identifies game identity, and later layers specialize.

Automatic synopsis generation for long-form videos, such as movies and TV series, presents a significant challenge for existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs). While proficient at single-image captioning, these general-purpose models often exhibit critical failures in long-duration contexts, primarily a lack of ID-consistent character identification and a fractured narrative coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose MovieTeller, a novel framework for generating movie synopses via tool-augmented progressive abstraction. Our core contribution is a training-free, tool-augmented, fact-grounded generation process. Instead of requiring costly model fine-tuning, our framework directly leverages off-the-shelf models in a plug-and-play manner. We first invoke a specialized face recognition model as an external \"tool\" to establish Factual Groundings--precise character identities and their corresponding bounding boxes. These groundings are then injected into the prompt to steer the VLM's reasoning, ensuring the generated scene descriptions are anchored to verifiable facts. Furthermore, our progressive abstraction pipeline decomposes the summarization of a full-length movie into a multi-stage process, effectively mitigating the context length limitations of current VLMs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach yields significant improvements in factual accuracy, character consistency, and overall narrative coherence compared to end-to-end baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "MovieTeller\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u6458\u8981\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u5177\u8f85\u52a9\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u62bd\u8c61\u63d0\u9ad8\u6458\u8981\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u6458\u8981\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u5a31\u4e50\u9886\u57df\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMovieTeller\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u5177\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u62bd\u8c61\u751f\u6210\u7535\u5f71\u6982\u8981\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u4eba\u7269\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u53d9\u4e8b\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "MovieTeller\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u81ea\u52a8\u6458\u8981\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

These repeats are important for protein structure and function, motivating decades of algorithmic work on repeat identification. Recent work has shown that protein language models (PLMs) identify repeats, by examining their behavior in masked-token prediction. To elucidate their internal mechanisms, we investigate how PLMs detect both exact and approximate repeats. We find that the mechanism for approximate repeats functionally subsumes that of exact repeats. We then characterize this mechanism, revealing two main stages: PLMs first build feature representations using both general positional attention heads and biologically specialized components, such as neurons that encode amino-acid similarity. Then, induction heads attend to aligned tokens across repeated segments, promoting the correct answer.

Project website at https://circle-lmm.github.io/", "summary": "Which multimodal model should we use for classification? Previous studies suggest that the answer lies in CLIP-like contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs), due to their remarkable performance in zero-shot classification. In contrast, Large Multimodal Models (LMM) are more suitable for complex tasks. In this work, we argue that this answer overlooks an important capability of LMMs: in-context learning. We benchmark state-of-the-art LMMs on diverse datasets for closed-world classification and find that, although their zero-shot performance is lower than CLIP's, LMMs with a few in-context examples can match or even surpass contrastive VLMs with cache-based adapters, their \"in-context\" equivalent. We extend this analysis to the open-world setting, where the generative nature of LMMs makes them more suitable for the task.

While there is a lot of active research on improving the machine learning algorithms for skeleton-based action recognition, not much attention has been given to the quality of the input skeleton data itself. This work demonstrates that by making use of multiple camera views to triangulate more accurate 3D~skeletons, the performance of state-of-the-art action recognition models can be improved significantly. This suggests that the quality of the input data is currently a limiting factor for the performance of these models.

The ROM is parameterized by an external control variable, the Reynolds number in the Navier-Stokes setting, with the transformer exploiting attention mechanisms to capture both temporal dependencies and parameter effects. The probabilistic VAE enables stochastic sampling of trajectory ensembles, providing predictive means and uncertainty quantification through the first two moments. After initial training on a limited set of dynamical regimes, the model is adapted to out-of-sample parameter regions using only sparse data. Its probabilistic formulation naturally supports ensemble generation, which we employ within an ensemble Kalman filtering framework to assimilate data and reconstruct full-state trajectories from minimal observations. We further show that, for the dynamical system considered, the dominant source of error in out-of-sample forecasts stems from distortions of the latent manifold rather than changes in the latent dynamics.

To address these challenges, we introduce GUIPruner, a training-free framework tailored for high-resolution GUI navigation.

Currently, IL-based methods have become a mainstream paradigm: models rely on standard driving behaviors given by experts, and learn to minimize the discrepancy between their actions and expert actions. However, this objective of \"only driving like the expert\" suffers from limited generalization: when encountering rare or unseen long-tail scenarios outside the distribution of expert demonstrations, models tend to produce unsafe decisions in the absence of prior experience. This raises a fundamental question: Can an E2E-AD system make reliable decisions without any expert action supervision? Motivated by this, we propose a unified framework named Risk-aware World Model Predictive Control (RaWMPC) to address this generalization dilemma through robust control, without reliance on expert demonstrations. Practically, RaWMPC leverages a world model to predict the consequences of multiple candidate actions and selects low-risk actions through explicit risk evaluation. To endow the world model with the ability to predict the outcomes of risky driving behaviors, we design a risk-aware interaction strategy that systematically exposes the world model to hazardous behaviors, making catastrophic outcomes predictable and thus avoidable. Furthermore, to generate low-risk candidate actions at test time, we introduce a self-evaluation distillation method to distill riskavoidance capabilities from the well-trained world model into a generative action proposal network without any expert demonstration.

To better learn structural link representation, we transform the original graph into its corresponding line graph and apply a Graph Transformer on it for connectedness prediction. This formulation overcomes the limitations of endpoint-embedding fusion on set-isomorphic links, enabling rich link representations and effective relational reasoning over the global structure.

However, accurate value estimation remains a challenge due to the limited coverage of the state-action space. Recent physics-informed approaches have sought to address this by imposing physical and geometric constraints on the value function through regularization defined over first-order partial differential equations (PDEs), such as the Eikonal equation. However, these formulations can often be ill-posed in complex, high-dimensional environments. In this work, we propose a physics-informed regularization derived from the viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. By providing a physics-based inductive bias, our approach grounds the learning process in optimal control theory, explicitly regularizing and bounding updates during value iterations. Furthermore, we leverage the Feynman-Kac theorem to recast the PDE solution as an expectation, enabling a tractable Monte Carlo estimation of the objective that avoids numerical instability in higher-order gradients. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves geometric consistency, making it broadly applicable to navigation and high-dimensional, complex manipulation tasks.

However, comprehensive IHC analysis is frequently limited by insufficient tissue quantities in small biopsies. Therefore, virtual multiplex staining emerges as an innovative solution to digitally transform H&E images into multiple IHC representations, yet current methods still face three critical challenges: (1) inadequate semantic guidance for multi-staining, (2) inconsistent distribution of immunochemistry staining, and (3) spatial misalignment across different stain modalities. To overcome these limitations, we present a prompt-guided framework for virtual multiplex IHC staining using only uniplex training data (PGVMS). Our framework introduces three key innovations corresponding to each challenge: First, an adaptive prompt guidance mechanism employing a pathological visual language model dynamically adjusts staining prompts to resolve semantic guidance limitations (Challenge 1). Second, our protein-aware learning strategy (PALS) maintains precise protein expression patterns by direct quantification and constraint of protein distributions (Challenge 2). Third, the prototype-consistent learning strategy (PCLS) establishes cross-image semantic interaction to correct spatial misalignments (Challenge 3).", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing research on spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG), given a textual query, mainly focuses on localizing targets in short videos of tens of seconds, typically less than one minute, which limits real-world applications. In this paper, we explore Long-Form STVG (LF-STVG), which aims to locate targets in long-term videos. Compared with short videos, long-term videos contain much longer temporal spans and more irrelevant information, making it difficult for existing STVG methods that process all frames at once. To address this challenge, we propose an AutoRegressive Transformer architecture for LF-STVG, termed ART-STVG. Unlike conventional STVG methods that require the entire video sequence to make predictions at once, ART-STVG treats the video as streaming input and processes frames sequentially, enabling efficient handling of long videos. To model spatio-temporal context, we design spatial and temporal memory banks and apply them to the decoders. Since memories from different moments are not always relevant to the current frame, we introduce simple yet effective memory selection strategies to provide more relevant information to the decoders, significantly improving performance. Furthermore, instead of parallel spatial and temporal localization, we propose a cascaded spatio-temporal design that connects the spatial decoder to the temporal decoder, allowing fine-grained spatial cues to assist complex temporal localization in long videos. Experiments on newly extended LF-STVG datasets show that ART-STVG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while achieving competitive performance on conventional short-form STVG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faART-STVG\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c6\u9891\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c6\u9891\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c6\u9891\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c6\u9891\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff08LF-STVG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aART-STVG\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u56de\u5f52Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ea7\u8054\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u7684LF-STVG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cART-STVG\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c6\u9891\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c6\u9891\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u9762\u4e5f\u53d6\u5f97\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ART-STVG\u4e3a\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c6\u9891\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Impressive progress has been made through ML and AI techniques with regards to large data set processing. This progress has increased the ability of the experimenter to digest data and make novel predictions regarding phenomena of interest.

Work has been attempted to bring causality into discussions of machine learning models of natural phenomena; however, a firm and unified theoretical treatment is lacking. This series of three papers explores the union of chemical theory, biological theory, probability theory and causality that will correct current causal flaws of machine learning in the natural sciences. This paper, Part 1 of the series, provides the formal framework of the foundational causal structure of phenomena in chemical biology and is extended to machine learning through the novel concept of focus, defined here as the ability of a machine learning algorithm to narrow down to a hidden underpinning mechanism in large data sets. Initial proof of these principles on a family of Akt inhibitors is also provided. The second paper containing Part 2 will provide a formal exploration of chemical similarity, and Part 3 will present extensive experimental evidence of how hidden causal structures weaken all machine learning in chemical biology.

Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact datasets that preserve the knowledge of large-scale training sets while drastically reducing storage and computation. Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled training-free distillation by leveraging pre-trained generative priors; however, existing guidance strategies remain limited. Current score-based methods either perform unguided denoising or rely on simple mode-based guidance toward instance prototype centroids (IPC centroids), which often are rudimentary and suboptimal. We propose Manifold-Guided Distillation (ManifoldGD), a training-free diffusion-based framework that integrates manifold consistent guidance at every denoising timestep. Our method employs IPCs computed via a hierarchical, divisive clustering of VAE latent features, yielding a multi-scale coreset of IPCs that captures both coarse semantic modes and fine intra-class variability. Using a local neighborhood of the extracted IPC centroids, we create the latent manifold for each diffusion denoising timestep.

We first curate an expert corpus of risk-disease correlations via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to refine Clinical ModernBERT, embedding diagnostic priors into the text encoder. To bridge the modality gap, we introduce a dual-encoder pre-training strategy utilizing DINOv3 and our refined BERT, optimized by a suite of four complementary loss functions. These losses are designed to capture multi-granular semantic alignment and handle the ambiguity of clinical correlations through soft labels. Finally, we leverage Qwen-3 to fuse these aligned features for precise disease classification.

Second, we design companding functions that greatly reduce the error in 8-bit optimizer state quantization. Together with 16-bit gradients, these techniques reduce AdamW memory from 16 bytes to 7 bytes per parameter, or 5 bytes with gradient release. They also cut model checkpoint sizes by more than half.\n  Experiments with FlashOptim applied to SGD, AdamW, and Lion show no measurable quality degradation on any task from a collection of standard vision and language benchmarks, including Llama-3.1-8B finetuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Accepted at CVPR 2026", "summary": "We identify occlusion reasoning as a fundamental yet overlooked aspect for 3D layout-conditioned generation. It is essential for synthesizing partially occluded objects with depth-consistent geometry and scale. While existing methods can generate realistic scenes that follow input layouts, they often fail to model precise inter-object occlusions. We propose SeeThrough3D, a model for 3D layout conditioned generation that explicitly models occlusions. We introduce an occlusion-aware 3D scene representation (OSCR), where objects are depicted as translucent 3D boxes placed within a virtual environment and rendered from desired camera viewpoint. The transparency encodes hidden object regions, enabling the model to reason about occlusions, while the rendered viewpoint provides explicit camera control during generation. We condition a pretrained flow based text-to-image image generation model by introducing a set of visual tokens derived from our rendered 3D representation. Furthermore, we apply masked self-attention to accurately bind each object bounding box to its corresponding textual description, enabling accurate generation of multiple objects without object attribute mixing. To train the model, we construct a synthetic dataset with diverse multi-object scenes with strong inter-object occlusions. SeeThrough3D generalizes effectively to unseen object categories and enables precise 3D layout control with realistic occlusions and consistent camera control.", "AI": {"tldr": "SeeThrough3D\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u906e\u6321\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad83D\u5e03\u5c40\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc6\u522b\u906e\u6321\u63a8\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a3D\u5e03\u5c40\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e14\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSeeThrough3D\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u906e\u6321\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u906e\u6321\u611f\u77e5\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\uff08OSCR\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7ed1\u5b9a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5bf9\u8c61\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u4e0e\u5176\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "result": "SeeThrough3D\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u903c\u771f\u906e\u6321\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u76f8\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7cbe\u786e3D\u5e03\u5c40\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "SeeThrough3D\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u5e03\u5c40\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent work exploits this convergence by aligning frozen pretrained vision and language models with lightweight alignment layers, but typically relies on contrastive losses and millions of paired samples. In this work, we ask whether meaningful alignment can be achieved with substantially less supervision. We introduce a semi-supervised setting in which pretrained unimodal encoders are aligned using a small number of image-text pairs together with large amounts of unpaired data. To address this challenge, we propose SOTAlign, a two-stage framework that first recovers a coarse shared geometry from limited paired data using a linear teacher, then refines the alignment on unpaired samples via an optimal-transport-based divergence that transfers relational structure without overconstraining the target space. Unlike existing semi-supervised methods, SOTAlign effectively leverages unpaired images and text, learning robust joint embeddings across datasets and encoder pairs, and significantly outperforming supervised and semi-supervised baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Since clients frequently operate on diverse hardware and software frameworks, transmitting a pre-trained model is often infeasible; instead, agents require raw data to train their own task-specific models locally. While dataset distillation attempts to compress training signals, current methods struggle to scale to high-resolution data and rarely achieve sufficiently small files. In this paper, we propose Pseudo-Labels as Data (PLADA), a method that completely eliminates pixel transmission. We assume agents are preloaded with a large, generic, unlabeled reference dataset (e.g., ImageNet-1K, ImageNet-21K) and communicate a new task by transmitting only the class labels for specific images. To address the distribution mismatch between the reference and target datasets, we introduce a pruning mechanism that filters the reference dataset to retain only the labels of the most semantically relevant images for the target task. This selection process simultaneously maximizes training efficiency and minimizes transmission payload.
