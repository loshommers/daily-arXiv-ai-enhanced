Standard BO models the process as a black box and ignores the intermediate observations and the underlying process structure. Partially Observable Gaussian Process Networks (POGPN) model the process as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). However, using intermediate observations is challenging when the observations are high-dimensional state-space time series. Process-expert knowledge can be used to extract low-dimensional latent features from the high-dimensional state-space data. We propose POGPN-JPSS, a framework that combines POGPN with Joint Parameter and State-Space (JPSS) modeling to use intermediate extracted information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of POGPN-JPSS on a challenging, high-dimensional simulation of a multi-stage bioethanol production process. Our results show that POGPN-JPSS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving the desired performance threshold twice as fast and with greater reliability.

In contrast, general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) lack the capability to interpret protein sequences and fall short in domain-specific knowledge, limiting their capacity for effective biosemantic reasoning. To combine the advantages of both, we propose BioBridge, a domain-adaptive continual pretraining framework for protein understanding. This framework employs Domain-Incremental Continual Pre-training (DICP) to infuse protein domain knowledge and general reasoning corpus into a LLM simultaneously, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Cross-modal alignment is achieved via a PLM-Projector-LLM pipeline, which maps protein sequence embeddings into the semantic space of the language model. Ultimately, an end-to-end optimization is adopted to uniformly support various tasks, including protein property prediction and knowledge question-answering. Our proposed BioBridge demonstrates performance comparable to that of mainstream PLMs on multiple protein benchmarks, such as EC and BindingDB.

Recent studies have shown that applying invertible transformations to activations can significantly improve quantization robustness by reducing activation outliers; however, existing approaches are largely restricted to rotation or Hadamard-based transformations. Moreover, most studies focused primarily on traditional quantization schemes, whereas modern hardware increasingly supports the microscaling (MX) data format. Attempts to combine both showed severe performance degradation, leading prior work to introduce assumptions on the transformations. In this work, we take a complementary perspective. First, we provide a theoretical analysis of transformations under MX quantization by deriving a bound on the quantization error. Our analysis emphasizes the importance of accounting for both the activation distribution and the underlying quantization structure. Building on this analysis, we propose LATMiX, a method that generalizes outlier reduction to learnable invertible affine transformations optimized using standard deep learning tools.

The objective is to recover an unknown signal $\\boldsymbol\u03b8^\\star \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ (where $d \\gg 1$) from a loss function $\\hat{R}(\\boldsymbol\u03b8)$ that depends on pairs of labels $(\\mathbf{x}_i \\cdot \\boldsymbol\u03b8, \\mathbf{x}_i \\cdot \\boldsymbol\u03b8^\\star)_{i=1}^n$, with $\\mathbf{x}_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I_d)$, in the proportional asymptotic regime $n \\asymp d$. Using the Kac-Rice formula, we analyze different complexities of the landscape -- defined as the expected number of critical points -- corresponding to various types of critical points, including local minima. We first show that some variational formulas previously established in the literature for these complexities can be drastically simplified, reducing to explicit variational problems over a finite number of scalar parameters that we can efficiently solve numerically. Our framework also provides detailed predictions for properties of the critical points, including the spectral properties of the Hessian and the joint distribution of labels. We apply our analysis to the real phase retrieval problem for which we derive complete topological phase diagrams of the loss landscape, characterizing notably BBP-type transitions where the Hessian at local minima (as predicted by the Kac-Rice formula) becomes unstable in the direction of the signal. We test the predictive power of our analysis to characterize gradient flow dynamics, finding excellent agreement with finite-size simulations of local optimization algorithms, and capturing fine-grained details such as the empirical distribution of labels.

We analyze 3.5 million cross-chain intents that moved \\$9.24B worth of tokens between June and November 2025 across three major protocols (Mayan Swift, Across, and deBridge), spanning nine blockchains.\n  For rational attackers, our results show that protocols with higher solver profitability, such as deBridge, are vulnerable under current parameters: 210 historical attack instances yield a mean net profit of \\$286.14, with 80.5\\% of attacks profitable. In contrast, Across remains robust in all tested configurations due to low solver margins and very high liquidity, while Mayan Swift is generally secure but becomes vulnerable under stress-test conditions. Under byzantine attacks, we show that it is possible to suppress availability across all protocols, causing dozens of failed intents and solver profit losses of up to \\$978 roughly every 16 minutes.

To alleviate this gap, we introduce an automated annotation pipeline that integrates kinematic-based motion computation with linguistic parsing, enabling detailed decomposition and description of complex human motions. Based on this pipeline, we construct and release the Kinematic Parsing Motion Benchmark (KPM-Bench), a novel open-source dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained motion understanding. KPM-Bench consists of (i) fine-grained video-caption pairs that comprehensively illustrate limb-level dynamics in complex actions, (ii) diverse and challenging question-answer pairs focusing specifically on motion understanding, and (iii) a meticulously curated evaluation set specifically designed to assess hallucination phenomena associated with motion descriptions. Furthermore, to address hallucination issues systematically, we propose the linguistically grounded Motion Parsing and Extraction (MoPE) algorithm, capable of accurately extracting motion-specific attributes directly from textual captions. Leveraging MoPE, we introduce a precise hallucination evaluation metric that functions independently of large-scale vision-language or language-only models.

Existing methods that tackle text-to-hand-motion generation or hand animation captioning rely on studio-captured datasets with limited actions and contexts, making them costly to scale to \"in-the-wild\" settings. Further, contemporary models and their training schemes struggle to capture animation fidelity with text-motion alignment. To address this, we (1) introduce '3D Hands in the Wild' (3D-HIW), a dataset of 32K 3D hand-motion sequences and aligned text, and (2) propose CLUTCH, an LLM-based hand animation system with two critical innovations: (a) SHIFT, a novel VQ-VAE architecture to tokenize hand motion, and (b) a geometric refinement stage to finetune the LLM. To build 3D-HIW, we propose a data annotation pipeline that combines vision-language models (VLMs) and state-of-the-art 3D hand trackers, and apply it to a large corpus of egocentric action videos covering a wide range of scenarios. To fully capture motion in-the-wild, CLUTCH employs SHIFT, a part-modality decomposed VQ-VAE, which improves generalization and reconstruction fidelity. Finally, to improve animation quality, we introduce a geometric refinement stage, where CLUTCH is co-supervised with a reconstruction loss applied directly to decoded hand motion parameters.

Traditionally, social minds have been regarded as an exclusive property of living beings. Although large language models (LLMs) are widely accepted as powerful approximations of human behavior, with multi-LLM system being extensively explored to enhance their capabilities, it remains controversial whether they can be meaningfully compared to human social minds. In this work, we explore neural synchrony between socially interacting LLMs as an empirical evidence for this debate. Specifically, we introduce neural synchrony during social simulations as a novel proxy for analyzing the sociality of LLMs at the representational level. Through carefully designed experiments, we demonstrate that it reliably reflects both social engagement and temporal alignment in their interactions. Our findings indicate that neural synchrony between LLMs is strongly correlated with their social performance, highlighting an important link between neural synchrony and the social behaviors of LLMs. Our work offers a new perspective to examine the \"social minds\" of LLMs, highlighting surprising parallels in the internal dynamics that underlie human and LLM social interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86LLMs\u662f\u5426\u5177\u6709\u793e\u4ea4\u5fc3\u667a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u795e\u7ecf\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u4e0e\u793e\u4ea4\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u662f\u5426\u5177\u6709\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4ea4\u5fc3\u667a\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u4ea4\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u795e\u7ecf\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u6765\u5206\u6790LLMs\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6027\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u4e0e\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u8868\u73b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u4e0eLLMs\u793e\u4ea4\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u5fc3\u667a\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u6765\u8861\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLMs\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u60ca\u4eba\u76f8\u4f3c\u4e4b\u5904\u3002"}}

Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) forecasting from satellite observations, however, remains challenging due to sparse and irregular sampling caused by cloud coverage, as well as the heterogeneous climatic conditions under which crops evolve. In this work, we propose a probabilistic forecasting framework specifically designed for field-level NDVI prediction under clear-sky acquisition constraints. The method leverages a transformer-based architecture that explicitly separates the modeling of historical vegetation dynamics from future exogenous information, integrating historical NDVI observations with both historical and future meteorological covariates. To address irregular revisit patterns and horizon-dependent uncertainty, we introduce a temporal-distance weighted quantile loss that aligns the training objective with the effective forecasting horizon. In addition, we incorporate cumulative and extreme-weather feature engineering to better capture delayed meteorological effects relevant to vegetation response. Extensive experiments on European satellite data demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms a diverse set of statistical, deep learning, and recent time series baselines across both point-wise and probabilistic evaluation metrics. Ablation studies further highlight the central role of target history, while showing that meteorological covariates provide complementary gains when jointly exploited.

Human curation of hard questions is highly expensive, especially in recent benchmarks using PhD-level domain knowledge to challenge the most capable models.

Here, we take inspiration from 16th-century mathematical duels to design The Token Games (TTG): an evaluation framework where models challenge each other by creating their own puzzles. We leverage the format of Programming Puzzles - given a Python function that returns a boolean, find inputs that make it return True - to flexibly represent problems and enable verifying solutions. Using results from pairwise duels, we then compute Elo ratings, allowing us to compare models relative to each other. We evaluate 10 frontier models on TTG, and closely match the ranking from existing benchmarks such as Humanity's Last Exam, without involving any human effort in creating puzzles. We also find that creating good puzzles is still a highly challenging task for current models, not measured by previous benchmarks.

CodeScaler is trained on carefully curated preference data derived from verified code problems and incorporates syntax-aware code extraction and validity-preserving reward shaping to ensure stable and robust optimization. Across five coding benchmarks, CodeScaler improves Qwen3-8B-Base by an average of +11.72 points, outperforming binary execution-based RL by +1.82 points, and enables scalable reinforcement learning on synthetic datasets without any test cases. At inference time, CodeScaler serves as an effective test-time scaling method, achieving performance comparable to unit test approaches while providing a 10-fold reduction in latency.

In many use cases, such as medical studies or political polling, different sources incur different sampling costs. Observations often have associated group identities (for example, health markers, demographics, or political affiliations) and the relative composition of these groups may differ substantially, both among the source populations and between sources and target population.\n  In this work, we study multi-source data collection under a fixed budget, focusing on the estimation of population means and group-conditional means. We show that naive data collection strategies (e.g. attempting to \"match\" the target distribution) or relying on standard estimators (e.g. sample mean) can be highly suboptimal. Instead, we develop a sampling plan which maximizes the effective sample size: the total sample size divided by $D_{\u03c7^2}(q\\mid\\mid\\overline{p}) + 1$, where $q$ is the target distribution, $\\overline{p}$ is the aggregated source distribution, and $D_{\u03c7^2}$ is the $\u03c7^2$-divergence. We pair this sampling plan with a classical post-stratification estimator and upper bound its risk. We provide matching lower bounds, establishing that our approach achieves the budgeted minimax optimal risk. Our techniques also extend to prediction problems when minimizing the excess risk, providing a principled approach to multi-source learning with costly and heterogeneous data sources.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the standard multi-step Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining is resource-intensive, expensive, and time-consuming, which is also often unavailable in many areas. Consequently, predicting HER2 levels directly from H&E slides has emerged as a potential alternative solution. It has been shown to be effective to use virtual IHC images from H&E images for automatic HER2 scoring. However, the pixel-level virtual staining methods are computationally expensive and prone to reconstruction artifacts that can propagate diagnostic errors. To address these limitations, we propose the Latent-Guided Dual-Stream Network (LGD-Net), a novel framework that employes cross-modal feature hallucination instead of explicit pixel-level image generation. LGD-Net learns to map morphological H&E features directly to the molecular latent space, guided by a teacher IHC encoder during training. To ensure the hallucinated features capture clinically relevant phenotypes, we explicitly regularize the model training with task-specific domain knowledge, specifically nuclei distribution and membrane staining intensity, via lightweight auxiliary regularization tasks. Extensive experiments on the public BCI dataset demonstrate that LGD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline methods while enabling efficient inference using single-modality H&E inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684HER2\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30HER2\u8868\u8fbe\u6c34\u5e73\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u9776\u5411\u6cbb\u7597\u9009\u62e9\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u514d\u75ab\u7ec4\u5316\uff08IHC\uff09\u67d3\u8272\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u6602\u8d35\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u5f88\u591a\u5730\u533a\u4e5f\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4eceH&E\u5207\u7247\u9884\u6d4bHER2\u6c34\u5e73\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLGD-Net\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5e7b\u89c9\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3002LGD-Net\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u5f62\u6001\u5b66H&E\u7279\u5f81\u76f4\u63a5\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5206\u5b50\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u6559\u5e08IHC\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u786e\u4fdd\u5e7b\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u6355\u83b7\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8868\u578b\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5730\u5c06\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6838\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u819c\u67d3\u8272\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff09\u7eb3\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171BCI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLGD-Net\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5141\u8bb8\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u6a21\u6001H&E\u8f93\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "LGD-Net\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684HER2\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684IHC\u67d3\u8272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Although effective on average, steering effect sizes vary across samples and are unreliable for many target behaviors. In my thesis, I investigate why steering reliability differs across behaviors and how it is impacted by steering vector training data. First, I find that higher cosine similarity between training activation differences predicts more reliable steering. Second, I observe that behavior datasets where positive and negative activations are better separated along the steering direction are more reliably steerable. Finally, steering vectors trained on different prompt variations are directionally distinct, yet perform similarly well and exhibit correlated efficacy across datasets. My findings suggest that steering vectors are unreliable when the latent target behavior representation is not effectively approximated by the linear steering direction.

Unlike expectation-based risk, CVaR depends on an endogenous, data-dependent quantile, which couples tail averaging with threshold estimation and fundamentally alters both generalization and robustness properties. In this work, we develop a learning-theoretic analysis of CVaR-based empirical risk minimization under heavy-tailed and contaminated data. We establish sharp, high-probability generalization and excess risk bounds under minimal moment assumptions, covering fixed hypotheses, finite and infinite classes, and extending to $\u03b2$-mixing dependent data; we further show that these rates are minimax optimal. To capture the intrinsic quantile sensitivity of CVaR, we derive a uniform Bahadur-Kiefer type expansion that isolates a threshold-driven error term absent in mean-risk ERM and essential in heavy-tailed regimes. We complement these results with robustness guarantees by proposing a truncated median-of-means CVaR estimator that achieves optimal rates under adversarial contamination. Finally, we show that CVaR decisions themselves can be intrinsically unstable under heavy tails, establishing a fundamental limitation on decision robustness even when the population optimum is well separated. Together, our results provide a principled characterization of when CVaR learning generalizes and is robust, and when instability is unavoidable due to tail scarcity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9 CVaR \u5728\u91cd\u5c3e\u548c\u6c61\u67d3\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a CVaR \u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7f55\u89c1\u4f46\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\u7684\u635f\u5931\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u5927\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u884c\u4e3a\u4ecd\u7136\u4e86\u89e3\u4e0d\u591a\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9 CVaR \u57fa\u4e8e\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5728\u91cd\u5c3e\u548c\u6c61\u67d3\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u77e9\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u9510\u5229\u3001\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u5269\u4f59\u98ce\u9669\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u56fa\u5b9a\u5047\u8bbe\u3001\u6709\u9650\u548c\u65e0\u9650\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230 \u03b2-\u6df7\u5408\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u6211\u4eec\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u901f\u7387\u662f\u6700\u5c0f\u6700\u5927\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u6355\u6349 CVaR \u7684\u5185\u5728\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684 Bahadur-Kiefer \u7c7b\u578b\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u8be5\u5c55\u5f00\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u5747\u503c\u98ce\u9669 ERM \u4e2d\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u9608\u503c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u9879\u9694\u79bb\u51fa\u6765\uff0c\u5728\u91cd\u5c3e\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u662f\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u622a\u65ad\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u5747\u503c CVaR \u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u6765\u8865\u5145\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8be5\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6c61\u67d3\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u901f\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86 CVaR \u51b3\u7b56\u672c\u8eab\u5728\u91cd\u5c3e\u4e0b\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u603b\u4f53\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e5f\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u9650\u5236\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u4f55\u65f6 CVaR \u5b66\u4e60\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7531\u4e8e\u5c3e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f55\u65f6\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u539f\u7406\u6027\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9 CVaR \u5728\u91cd\u5c3e\u548c\u6c61\u67d3\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a CVaR \u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

This vision paper examines this evolution and argues for a fundamental shift in how we approach distributed security: from studying individual security properties in isolation to understanding their synergistic combinations. We begin by conclude four foundational properties, \\textit{agreement, consistency, privacy, verifiability, accountability}. We trace their theoretical origins and practical maturation. We then demonstrate how the frontier of research now lies at the intersection of these properties, where their fusion creates capabilities that neither property could achieve alone. Looking forward, we identify critical research challenges: discovering new security properties driven by emerging applications, developing systematic frameworks for property convergence, managing the computational overhead of cryptographic primitives in high-performance consensus layers, and addressing post-quantum and human-factor challenges.

The main reason for such ineffectiveness is that once deployed in a system (e.g., within a simulator), attacks tend to be spatially or temporally short-lived, due to the vehicle's dynamics, hence rarely influencing the vehicle behaviour. In this paper, we address both limitations by introducing a system-level attack in which multiple dynamic elements (e.g., two pedestrians) carry adversarial patches (e.g., on cloths) and jointly amplify their effect through coordination and motion. We evaluate our attacks in the CARLA simulator using a state-of-the-art autonomous driving agent. At the system level, single-pedestrian attacks fail in all runs (out of 10), while dynamic collusion by two pedestrians induces full vehicle stops in up to 50\\% of runs, with static collusion yielding no successful attack at all.

This paper presents the first systematic comparison of instruction optimization, based on the DSPy optimization framework, for tabular fact verification. We evaluate four out-of-the-box prompting techniques that cover both text-only prompting and code use: direct prediction, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), ReAct with SQL tools, and CodeAct with Python execution. We study three optimizers from the DSPy framework -- COPRO, MiPROv2, and SIMBA -- across four benchmarks and three model families. We find that instruction optimization consistently improves verification accuracy, with MiPROv2 yielding the most stable gains for CoT, and SIMBA providing the largest benefits for ReAct agents, particularly at larger model scales.

We perform a systematic analysis of this offline RL and cross-embodiment paradigm, providing a principled understanding of its strengths and limitations. To evaluate this offline RL and cross-embodiment paradigm, we construct a suite of locomotion datasets spanning 16 distinct robot platforms. Our experiments confirm that this combined approach excels at pre-training with datasets rich in suboptimal trajectories, outperforming pure behavior cloning. However, as the proportion of suboptimal data and the number of robot types increase, we observe that conflicting gradients across morphologies begin to impede learning. To mitigate this, we introduce an embodiment-based grouping strategy in which robots are clustered by morphological similarity and the model is updated with a group gradient.

Existing multi-modal pre-training methods largely overlook robustness, treating it as a downstream adaptation problem. In this work, we propose Robust Multi-Modal Masked Reconstruction (Robust-MMR), a self-supervised pre-training framework that explicitly incorporates robustness objectives into masked vision-language learning. Robust-MMR integrates asymmetric perturbation-aware masking, domain-consistency regularization, and modality-resilience constraints to encourage domain-invariant representations. We evaluate Robust-MMR on multiple medical vision-language benchmarks, including medical visual question answering (VQA-RAD, SLAKE, VQA-2019), cross-domain image-text classification (MELINDA), and robust image-caption retrieval (ROCO). Robust-MMR achieves 78.9% cross-domain accuracy on VQA-RAD, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.8 percentage points, and reaches 74.6% and 77.0% accuracy on SLAKE and VQA-2019, respectively. Under perturbed evaluation, Robust-MMR improves VQA-RAD accuracy from 69.1% to 75.6%. For image-text classification, cross-domain MELINDA accuracy increases from 70.3% to 75.2%, while retrieval experiments show a reduction in mean rank degradation from over 16 to 4.1 under perturbation. Qualitative results further demonstrate improved clinical reasoning for disease detection and structural abnormality assessment. These findings show that explicitly modeling robustness during pre-training leads to more reliable and transferable medical vision-language representations for real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

For many downstream tasks, however, the clinically meaningful unit is not a single CUI but a concept set comprising related synonyms, subtypes, and supertypes. Constructing such concept sets is labour-intensive, inconsistently performed, and poorly supported by existing tools, particularly for NLP pipelines that operate directly on UMLS CUIs. Methods We present CUICurate, a Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) framework for automated UMLS concept set curation. A UMLS knowledge graph (KG) was constructed and embedded for semantic retrieval. For each target concept, candidate CUIs were retrieved from the KG, followed by large language model (LLM) filtering and classification steps comparing two LLMs (GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini). The framework was evaluated on five lexically heterogeneous clinical concepts against a manually curated benchmark and gold-standard concept sets. Results Across all concepts, CUICurate produced substantially larger and more complete concept sets than the manual benchmarks whilst matching human precision. Comparisons between the two LLMs found that GPT-5-mini achieved higher recall during filtering, while GPT-5 produced classifications that more closely aligned with clinician judgements. Outputs were stable across repeated runs and computationally inexpensive.

Current theoretical explanations for this capability assume test tasks are drawn from a distribution similar to that seen during pretraining. This assumption overlooks adversarial distribution shifts that threaten real-world reliability. To address this gap, we introduce a distributionally robust meta-learning framework that provides worst-case performance guarantees for ICL under Wasserstein-based distribution shifts. Focusing on linear self-attention Transformers, we derive a non-asymptotic bound linking adversarial perturbation strength ($\u03c1$), model capacity ($m$), and the number of in-context examples ($N$). The analysis reveals that model robustness scales with the square root of its capacity ($\u03c1_{\\text{max}} \\propto \\sqrt{m}$), while adversarial settings impose a sample complexity penalty proportional to the square of the perturbation magnitude ($N_\u03c1- N_0 \\propto \u03c1^2$). Experiments on synthetic tasks confirm these scaling laws. These findings advance the theoretical understanding of ICL's limits under adversarial conditions and suggest that model capacity serves as a fundamental resource for distributional robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u5bf9ICL\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728Wasserstein\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5bf9\u7ebf\u6027\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529bTransformer\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\u6570\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u65bd\u52a0\u4e86\u4e0e\u6270\u52a8\u5e45\u5ea6\u5e73\u65b9\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u7684\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6bd4\u4f8b\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bICL\u9650\u5236\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u662f\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

However, the inherently redundant nature of video sequences poses significant challenges for contemporary state-of-the-art models. These challenges stem from two primary aspects: 1) efficiently incorporating a larger number of frames within memory constraints, and 2) extracting discriminative information from the vast volume of input data. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end schema for long-form video understanding, which includes an information-density-based adaptive video sampler (AVS) and an autoencoder-based spatiotemporal video compressor (SVC) integrated with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our proposed system offers two major advantages: it adaptively and effectively captures essential information from video sequences of varying durations, and it achieves high compression rates while preserving crucial discriminative information. The proposed framework demonstrates promising performance across various benchmarks, excelling in both long-form video understanding tasks and standard video understanding benchmarks.

We study a frequent failure mode in which the correct document is retrieved but the page or chunk that contains the answer is missed, leading the generator to extrapolate from incomplete context. Despite its practical significance, this within-document retrieval failure mode has received limited systematic attention in the Financial Question Answering (QA) literature. We evaluate retrieval at multiple levels of granularity, document, page, and chunk level, and introduce an oracle based analysis to provide empirical upper bounds on retrieval and generative performance. On a 150 question subset of FinanceBench, we reproduce and compare diverse retrieval strategies including dense, sparse, hybrid, and hierarchical methods with reranking and query reformulation. Across methods, gains in document discovery tend to translate into stronger page recall, yet oracle performance still suggests headroom for page and chunk level retrieval.

We show that this assumption is false. Using SOMtime, a topology-preserving representation method based on high-capacity Self-Organizing Maps, we demonstrate that sensitive attributes such as age and income emerge as dominant latent axes in purely unsupervised embeddings, even when explicitly excluded from the input. On two large-scale real-world datasets (the World Values Survey across five countries and the Census-Income dataset), SOMtime recovers monotonic orderings aligned with withheld sensitive attributes, achieving Spearman correlations of up to 0.85, whereas PCA and UMAP typically remain below 0.23 (with a single exception reaching 0.31), and against t-SNE and autoencoders which achieve at most 0.34. Furthermore, unsupervised segmentation of SOMtime embeddings produces demographically skewed clusters, demonstrating downstream fairness risks without any supervised task. These findings establish that \\textit{fairness through unawareness} fails at the representation level for ordinal sensitive attributes and that fairness auditing must extend to unsupervised components of machine learning pipelines.

Existing unlearning methods target parameters alone, leaving two critical gaps: (i) parameter-memory backflow, where retrieval reactivates parametric remnants or memory artifacts reintroduce sensitive content, and (ii) the absence of a unified strategy that covers both parameter and memory pathways. We present Synchronized Backflow Unlearning (SBU), a framework that unlearns jointly across parameter and memory pathways. The memory pathway performs dependency closure-based unlearning that prunes isolated entities while logically invalidating shared artifacts. The parameter pathway employs stochastic reference alignment to guide model outputs toward a high-entropy prior. These pathways are integrated via a synchronized dual-update protocol, forming a closed-loop mechanism where memory unlearning and parametric suppression reinforce each other to prevent cross-pathway recontamination.

We test a large number of recent VLMs on fine-grained classification benchmarks and identify potential factors in the disconnect between fine-grained knowledge and other vision benchmarks. Through a series of ablation experiments, we find that using a better LLM improves all benchmark scores equally, while a better vision encoder disproportionately improves fine-grained classification performance.

However, learning efficiency is constrained by the model's ability to rapidly explore diverse high-probability regions during training. To mitigate this issue, recent works have focused on incentivizing the exploration of unvisited and valuable states via curiosity-driven search and self-supervised random network distillation, which tend to waste samples on already well-approximated regions of the state space. In this context, we propose Adaptive Complementary Exploration (ACE), a principled algorithm for the effective exploration of novel and high-probability regions when learning GFlowNets. To achieve this, ACE introduces an exploration GFlowNet explicitly trained to search for high-reward states in regions underexplored by the canonical GFlowNet, which learns to sample from the target distribution.

However, in practice, the quality and consistency of the synthesized views are fundamentally limited by the reliability of the underlying depth estimates, which are often fragile under low texture, adverse weather, and occlusion-heavy real-world conditions. In this work, we show that incorporating sparse multimodal range measurements provides a simple yet effective way to overcome these limitations. We introduce a multimodal depth reconstruction framework that leverages extremely sparse range sensing data, such as automotive radar or LiDAR, to produce dense depth maps that serve as robust geometric conditioning for diffusion-based novel view synthesis. Our approach models depth in an angular domain using a localized Gaussian Process formulation, enabling computationally efficient inference while explicitly quantifying uncertainty in regions with limited observations. The reconstructed depth and uncertainty are used as a drop-in replacement for monocular depth estimators in existing diffusion-based rendering pipelines, without modifying the generative model itself. Experiments on real-world multimodal driving scenes demonstrate that replacing vision-only depth with our sparse range-based reconstruction substantially improves both geometric consistency and visual quality in single-image novel-view video generation. These results highlight the importance of reliable geometric priors for diffusion-based view synthesis and demonstrate the practical benefits of multimodal sensing even at extreme levels of sparsity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u516c\u5f0f\u5728\u89d2\u57df\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u4ee3\u66ff\u4ec5\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u4e5f\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u76ca\u3002"}}

This paper presents the first hardware-level backend retrieval data-stealing attack, showing that accelerator optimizations designed for performance can directly undermine data confidentiality and bypass state-of-the-art privacy defenses.\n  Our attack, FEATUREBLEED, exploits zero-skipping in AI accelerators to infer private backend-retrieved features solely through end-to-end timing, without relying on power analysis, DVFS manipulation, or shared-cache side channels. We evaluate FEATUREBLEED on three datasets spanning medical and non-medical domains: Texas-100X (clinical records), OrganAMNIST (medical imaging), and Census-19 (socioeconomic data). We further evaluate FEATUREBLEED across three hardware backends (Intel AVX, Intel AMX, and NVIDIA A100) and three model architectures (DNNs, CNNs, and hybrid CNN-MLP pipelines), demonstrating that the leakage generalizes across CPU and GPU accelerators, data modalities, and application domains, with an adversarial advantage of up to 98.87 percentage points.\n  Finally, we identify the root cause of the leakage as sparsity-driven zero-skipping in modern hardware. We quantify the privacy-performance-power trade-off: disabling zero-skipping increases Intel AMX per-operation energy by up to 25 percent and incurs 100 percent performance overhead. We propose a padding-based defense that masks timing leakage by equalizing responses to the worst-case execution time, achieving protection with only 7.24 percent average performance overhead and no additional power cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u51fa\u786c\u4ef6\u7ea7\u540e\u7aef\u68c0\u7d22\u6570\u636e\u7a83\u53d6\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u53ef\u7ed5\u8fc7\u9690\u79c1\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u65ad\u79c1\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u4ea7\u54c1\u63a8\u8350\u3001\u533b\u7597\u548c\u91d1\u878d\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u673a\u5bc6\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u68c0\u7d22\u5f71\u54cd\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u79c1\u6709\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u9690\u85cf\u4e8eAPI\u8c03\u7528\u8005\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u65ad\u79c1\u6709\u540e\u7aef\u68c0\u7d22\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u529f\u8017\u5206\u6790\u3001DVFS\u64cd\u4f5c\u6216\u5171\u4eab\u7f13\u5b58\u4fa7\u4fe1\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u533b\u7597\u548c\u975e\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86FEATUREBLEED\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728CPU\u548cGPU\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u4f18\u52bf\u9ad8\u8fbe98.87\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFEATUREBLEED\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u7ea7\u540e\u7aef\u68c0\u7d22\u6570\u636e\u7a83\u53d6\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u8be5\u653b\u51fb\u5229\u7528AI\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u96f6\u8df3\u8fc7\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u65ad\u79c1\u6709\u540e\u7aef\u68c0\u7d22\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u76f4\u63a5\u5a01\u80c1\u6570\u636e\u673a\u5bc6\u6027\u5e76\u7ed5\u8fc7\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

Code and models available at https://github.com/Bluesman79/ZACH-ViT", "summary": "Vision Transformers rely on positional embeddings and class tokens that encode fixed spatial priors. While effective for natural images, these priors may hinder generalization when spatial layout is weakly informative or inconsistent, a frequent condition in medical imaging and edge-deployed clinical systems. We introduce ZACH-ViT (Zero-token Adaptive Compact Hierarchical Vision Transformer), a compact Vision Transformer that removes both positional embeddings and the [CLS] token, achieving permutation invariance through global average pooling over patch representations. The term \"Zero-token\" specifically refers to removing the dedicated [CLS] aggregation token and positional embeddings; patch tokens remain unchanged and are processed normally. Adaptive residual projections preserve training stability in compact configurations while maintaining a strict parameter budget.\n  Evaluation is performed across seven MedMNIST datasets spanning binary and multi-class tasks under a strict few-shot protocol (50 samples per class, fixed hyperparameters, five random seeds). The empirical analysis demonstrates regime-dependent behavior: ZACH-ViT (0.25M parameters, trained from scratch) achieves its strongest advantage on BloodMNIST and remains competitive with TransMIL on PathMNIST, while its relative advantage decreases on datasets with strong anatomical priors (OCTMNIST, OrganAMNIST), consistent with the architectural hypothesis. These findings support the view that aligning architectural inductive bias with data structure can be more important than pursuing universal benchmark dominance. Despite its minimal size and lack of pretraining, ZACH-ViT achieves competitive performance while maintaining sub-second inference times, supporting deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments.

There is growing interest in fine-tuning these models for such domains; however, progress is constrained by the scarcity and limited coverage of high-quality, task-relevant data. To address this, synthetic data generation methods such as paraphrasing or knowledge extraction are commonly applied. Although these approaches excel at factual recall and conceptual knowledge, they suffer from two critical shortcomings: (i) they provide minimal support for interpretive reasoning capabilities in these specialized domains, and (ii) they often produce synthetic corpora that are excessively large and redundant, resulting in poor sample efficiency. To overcome these gaps, we propose an adversarial question-generation framework that produces a compact set of semantically challenging questions. These questions are constructed by comparing the outputs of the model to be adapted and a robust expert model grounded in reference documents, using an iterative, feedback-driven process designed to reveal and address comprehension gaps.

While decoding-time personalization offers a scalable alternative to training-time methods, existing methods largely rely on implicit, less interpretable preference representations and impose a rigid, context-agnostic user representation, failing to account for how preferences shift across prompts. We introduce EXACT, a new decoding-time personalization that aligns generation with limited pairwise preference feedback using a predefined set of interpretable attributes. EXACT first identifies user-specific attribute subsets by maximizing the likelihood of preferred responses in the offline stage. Then, for online inference, EXACT retrieves the most semantically relevant attributes for an incoming prompt and injects them into the context to steer generation. We establish theoretical approximation guarantees for the proposed algorithm under mild assumptions, and provably show that our similarity-based retrieval mechanism effectively mitigates contextual preference shifts, adapting to disparate tasks without pooling conflicting preferences.

We show that an adversary can systematically exploit clarification-seeking behavior$-$commonly encouraged in multi-turn conversation settings$-$to scalably prolong interactions. Moving beyond prompt-level behaviors, we take a mechanistic perspective and identify a query-independent, universal activation subspace associated with clarification-seeking responses. Unlike prior cost-amplification attacks that rely on per-turn prompt optimization, our attack arises from conversational dynamics and persists across prompts and tasks. We show that this mechanism provides a scalable pathway to induce turn amplification: both supply-chain attacks via fine-tuning and runtime attacks through low-level parameter corruptions consistently shift models toward abstract, clarification-seeking behavior across prompts. Across multiple instruction-tuned LLMs and benchmarks, our attack substantially increases turn count while remaining compliant.

However, their performance is constrained by the quality of the reference image, which limits real-world applications where ideal reference sources are unavailable. Notably, the human visual system has the ability to accumulate visual memory, allowing image quality assessment on the basis of long-term memory storage. Inspired by this biological memory mechanism, we propose a memory-driven quality-aware framework (MQAF), which establishes a memory bank for storing distortion patterns and dynamically switches between dual-mode quality assessment strategies to reduce reliance on high-quality reference images. When reference images are available, MQAF obtains reference-guided quality scores by adaptively weighting reference information and comparing the distorted image with stored distortion patterns in the memory bank. When the reference image is absent, the framework relies on distortion patterns in the memory bank to infer image quality, enabling no-reference quality assessment (NR-IQA). The experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple datasets while adapting to both no-reference and full-reference tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6MQAF\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5168\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08FR-IQA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5b58\u50a8\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9a71\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff08MQAF\uff09\u3002", "method": "MQAF\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\u5b58\u50a8\u626d\u66f2\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5207\u6362\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u5f53\u6709\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u53c2\u8003\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\u4e2d\u5b58\u50a8\u7684\u626d\u66f2\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6765\u83b7\u53d6\u53c2\u8003\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u3002\u5f53\u6ca1\u6709\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u626d\u66f2\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08NR-IQA\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u548c\u5168\u53c2\u8003\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "MQAF\u901a\u8fc7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We analyze compression behavior across three progressively more complex information ecosystems: controlled human-LLM continuations, generative mediation of a knowledge infrastructure (Wikipedia vs. Grokipedia), and fully synthetic social interaction environments (Moltbook vs. Reddit). Across settings, compression reveals a persistent structural signature of probabilistic generation. In controlled and mediated contexts, LLM-produced language exhibits higher structural regularity and compressibility than human-written text, consistent with a concentration of output within highly recurrent statistical patterns. However, this signature shows scale dependence: in fragmented interaction environments the separation attenuates, suggesting a fundamental limit to surface-level distinguishability at small scales. This compressibility-based separation emerges consistently across models, tasks, and domains and can be observed directly from surface text without relying on model internals or semantic evaluation.

Yet, the vast configuration space of inference servers makes exhaustive empirical evaluation infeasible due to combinatorial explosion. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on this problem by treating LLMs as configurable systems and applying variability management techniques to systematically analyze inference-time configuration choices. We evaluate our approach on the Hugging Face Transformers library by representing generation hyperparameters and their constraints using a feature-based variability model, sampling representative configurations, measuring their energy consumption, latency, accuracy, and learning predictive models from the collected data. Our results show that variability modeling effectively manages the complexity of LLM inference configurations. It enables systematic analysis of hyperparameters effects and interactions, reveals trade-offs, and supports accurate prediction of inference behavior from a limited number of measurements.

With this in mind, this paper proposes an LLM-centric Affective Visual Customization (L-AVC) task, which focuses on generating images within modifying their subjective emotions via Multimodal LLM. Further, this paper contends that how to make the model efficiently align emotion conversion in semantics (named inter-emotion semantic conversion) and how to precisely retain emotion-agnostic contents (named exter-emotion semantic retaining) are rather important and challenging in this L-AVC task. To this end, this paper proposes an Efficient and Precise Emotion Manipulating approach for editing subjective emotions in images.

Furthermore, this paper reveals two key challenges in the proposed task: 1) how to effectively model the coarse-to-fine physical-world information (e.g., human behavior, object interactions and background context) to boost the DeepSVU task; and 2) how to adaptively trade off these factors.

Existing samplers typically adopt greedy heuristics, prioritizing positions with the highest local certainty to decode at each step. Through failure case analysis, we identify a fundamental limitation of this approach: it neglects the downstream impact of current decoding choices on subsequent steps and fails to minimize cumulative uncertainty. In particular, these methods do not fully exploit the non-causal nature of MDMs, which enables evaluating how a decoding decision reshapes token probabilities/uncertainty across all remaining masked positions. To bridge this gap, we propose the Info-Gain Sampler, a principled decoding framework that balances immediate uncertainty with information gain over future masked tokens. Extensive evaluations across diverse architectures and tasks (reasoning, coding, creative writing, and image generation) demonstrate that Info-Gain Sampler consistently outperforms existing samplers for MDMs. For instance, it achieves a 3.6% improvement in average accuracy on reasoning tasks and a 63.1% win-rate in creative writing. Notably, on reasoning tasks it reduces cumulative uncertainty from 78.4 to 48.6, outperforming the best baseline by a large margin.

To enhance performance, existing methods often incorporate extra observation cues (e.g., depth maps, point clouds) or auxiliary modules (e.g., object detectors, encoders) to enable more precise and reliable task execution, yet these typically require costly data collection and additional training. Inspired by the finding that Feed-Forward Network (FFN) in language models can act as \"key-value memory\", we propose Uncertainty-aware Observation Reinjection (UAOR), an effective, training-free and plug-and-play module for VLA models. Specifically, when the current language model layer exhibits high uncertainty, measured by Action Entropy, it reinjects key observation information into the next layer's Feed-Forward Network (FFN) through attention retrieval. This mechanism helps VLAs better attend to observations during inference, enabling more confident and faithful action generation.

While measures of such load have played an important role in psycholinguistic theories, they have been formalized, largely, using symbolic grammars, which assign discrete, uniform costs to syntactic predictions. This study proposes a measure of processing storage cost based on an information-theoretic formalization, as the amount of information previous words carry about future context, under uncertainty. Unlike previous discrete, grammar-based metrics, this measure is continuous, theory-neutral, and can be estimated from pre-trained neural language models. The validity of this approach is demonstrated through three analyses in English: our measure (i) recovers well-known processing asymmetries in center embeddings and relative clauses, (ii) correlates with a grammar-based storage cost in a syntactically-annotated corpus, and (iii) predicts reading-time variance in two large-scale naturalistic datasets over and above baseline models with traditional information-based predictors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5904\u7406\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u53e5\u5b50\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8d1f\u8377\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u53e5\u5b50\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u627f\u62c5\u91cd\u8981\u8d1f\u8377\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ef4\u6301\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u540e\u7eed\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u5904\u7406\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6839\u636e\u5148\u524d\u5355\u8bcd\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u643a\u5e26\u5173\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a(i) \u6062\u590d\u4e86\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4ece\u53e5\u4e2d\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff1b(ii) \u4e0e\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bed\u6cd5\u57fa\u7840\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u5728\u53e5\u6cd5\u6807\u6ce8\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e2d\u76f8\u5173\uff1b(iii) \u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u6599\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u9605\u8bfb\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u53e5\u5b50\u7406\u89e3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8d1f\u8377\u3002"}}

Traditional temporal diffusion models suffer from local entanglement and the $\\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ cost of attention mechanisms. We address these limitations by introducing PaCoDi (Parallel Complex Diffusion), a spectral-native architecture that decouples generative modeling in the frequency domain. PaCoDi fundamentally alters the problem topology: the Fourier Transform acts as a diagonalizing operator, converting locally coupled temporal signals into globally decorrelated spectral components. Theoretically, we prove the Quadrature Forward Diffusion and Conditional Reverse Factorization theorem, demonstrating that the complex diffusion process can be split into independent real and imaginary branches. We bridge the gap between this decoupled theory and data reality using a \\textbf{Mean Field Theory (MFT) approximation} reinforced by an interactive correction mechanism. Furthermore, we generalize this discrete DDPM to continuous-time Frequency SDEs, rigorously deriving the Spectral Wiener Process describe the differential spectral Brownian motion limit. Crucially, PaCoDi exploits the Hermitian Symmetry of real-valued signals to compress the sequence length by half, achieving a 50% reduction in attention FLOPs without information loss.

Existing attention manipulation methods focus exclusively on the Key space to modulate attention routing, leaving the Value space -- which governs feature aggregation -- entirely unexploited. In this paper, we first reveal that both Key and Value projections in DiT's multi-modal attention layers exhibit a pronounced bias-delta structure, where token embeddings cluster tightly around a layer-specific bias vector. Building on this observation, we propose Dual-Channel Attention Guidance (DCAG), a training-free framework that simultaneously manipulates both the Key channel (controlling where to attend) and the Value channel (controlling what to aggregate). We provide a theoretical analysis showing that the Key channel operates through the nonlinear softmax function, acting as a coarse control knob, while the Value channel operates through linear weighted summation, serving as a fine-grained complement. Together, the two-dimensional parameter space $(\u03b4_k, \u03b4_v)$ enables more precise editing-fidelity trade-offs than any single-channel method. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark (700 images, 10 editing categories) demonstrate that DCAG consistently outperforms Key-only guidance across all fidelity metrics, with the most significant improvements observed in localized editing tasks such as object deletion (4.9% LPIPS reduction) and object addition (3.2% LPIPS reduction).", "AI": {"tldr": "DCAG improves editing fidelity in DiT-based image editing models.", "motivation": "Training-free control over editing intensity is critical for diffusion-based image editing models built on the Diffusion Transformer architecture.", "method": "Proposing Dual-Channel Attention Guidance (DCAG) to manipulate both the Key and Value channels in DiT's multi-modal attention layers.", "result": "DCAG outperforms Key-only guidance in editing tasks, with significant improvements in object deletion and addition.", "conclusion": "DCAG is a training-free framework that enhances editing fidelity in diffusion-based image editing models."}}

However, prior studies show that reasoning uncertainty is highly localized: a small subset of low-confidence tokens disproportionately contributes to reasoning errors and unnecessary output expansion. Motivated by this observation, we propose Thinking by Subtraction, a confidence-driven contrastive decoding approach that improves reasoning reliability through targeted token-level intervention. Our method, Confidence-Driven Contrastive Decoding, detects low-confidence tokens during decoding and intervenes selectively at these positions. It constructs a contrastive reference by replacing high-confidence tokens with minimal placeholders, and refines predictions by subtracting this reference distribution at low-confidence locations. Experiments show that CCD significantly improves accuracy across mathematical reasoning benchmarks while substantially reducing output length, with minimal KV-cache overhead. As a training-free method, CCD enhances reasoning reliability through targeted low-confidence intervention without computational redundancy.

Recent works typically apply semantically coarse category names as auxiliary contexts to guide the learning of discriminative visual features. However, such context provided by the action names is too limited to provide sufficient background knowledge for capturing novel spatial and temporal concepts in actions. In this paper, we propose DiST, an innovative Decomposition-incorporation framework for FSAR that makes use of decoupled Spatial and Temporal knowledge provided by large language models to learn expressive multi-granularity prototypes. In the decomposition stage, we decouple vanilla action names into diverse spatio-temporal attribute descriptions (action-related knowledge). Such commonsense knowledge complements semantic contexts from spatial and temporal perspectives. In the incorporation stage, we propose Spatial/Temporal Knowledge Compensators (SKC/TKC) to discover discriminative object-level and frame-level prototypes, respectively. In SKC, object-level prototypes adaptively aggregate important patch tokens under the guidance of spatial knowledge. Moreover, in TKC, frame-level prototypes utilize temporal attributes to assist in inter-frame temporal relation modeling. These learned prototypes thus provide transparency in capturing fine-grained spatial details and diverse temporal patterns.

We address this challenge by designing, building, and evaluating ELIA (Explainable Language Interpretability Analysis), an interactive web application that simplifies the outcomes of various language model component analyses for a broader audience. The system integrates three key techniques -- Attribution Analysis, Function Vector Analysis, and Circuit Tracing -- and introduces a novel methodology: using a vision-language model to automatically generate natural language explanations (NLEs) for the complex visualizations produced by these methods. The effectiveness of this approach was empirically validated through a mixed-methods user study, which revealed a clear preference for interactive, explorable interfaces over simpler, static visualizations. A key finding was that the AI-powered explanations helped bridge the knowledge gap for non-experts; a statistical analysis showed no significant correlation between a user's prior LLM experience and their comprehension scores, suggesting that the system reduced barriers to comprehension across experience levels.

We introduce CityGuard, a topology-aware transformer for privacy-preserving identity retrieval in decentralized surveillance. The framework integrates three components. A dispersion-adaptive metric learner adjusts instance-level margins according to feature spread, increasing intra-class compactness. Spatially conditioned attention injects coarse geometry, such as GPS or deployment floor plans, into graph-based self-attention to enable projectively consistent cross-view alignment using only coarse geometric priors without requiring survey-grade calibration.

These texts allow researchers to study psychological constructs, detect mental health issues and analyze emotional language. However, mental health data can be difficult to collect correctly from social media, due to suppositions made by the collectors. A more pragmatic strategy involves gathering data through open-ended questions and then assessing this information with self-report screening surveys. This method was employed successfully for English, a language with a lot of psychological NLP resources. However, this cannot be stated for Romanian, which currently has no open-source mental health corpus. To address this gap, we have created the first corpus for depression and anxiety in Romanian, by utilizing a form with 6 open-ended questions along with the standardized PHQ-9 and GAD-7 screening questionnaires. Consisting of the texts of 205 respondents and although it may seem small, PsihoRo is a first step towards understanding and analyzing texts regarding the mental health of the Romanian population.

A critical subset of this backlog comprises appellate cases, which are formal decisions issued by higher courts reviewing the rulings of lower courts. To this end, we present Vichara, a novel framework tailored to the Indian judicial system that predicts and explains appellate judgments. Vichara processes English-language appellate case proceeding documents and decomposes them into decision points. Decision points are discrete legal determinations that encapsulate the legal issue, deciding authority, outcome, reasoning, and temporal context. The structured representation isolates the core determinations and their context, enabling accurate predictions and interpretable explanations. Vichara's explanations follow a structured format inspired by the IRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) framework and adapted for Indian legal reasoning. This enhances interpretability, allowing legal professionals to assess the soundness of predictions efficiently. We evaluate Vichara on two datasets, PredEx and the expert-annotated subset of the Indian Legal Documents Corpus (ILDC_expert), using four large language models: GPT-4o mini, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B.

We address this limitation with a two-phase training strategy for fine-grained road marking segmentation that removes full supervision during pretraining and halves the amount of training data during fine-tuning while still outperforming the comparable supervised baseline model. During the self-supervised pretraining, BEVFormer predictions are differentiably reprojected into the image plane and trained against multi-view semantic pseudo-labels generated by the widely used semantic segmentation model Mask2Former. A temporal loss encourages consistency across frames. The subsequent supervised fine-tuning phase requires only 50% of the dataset and significantly less training time. With our method, the fine-tuning benefits from rich priors learned during pretraining boosting the performance and BEV segmentation quality (up to +2.5pp mIoU over the fully supervised baseline) on nuScenes. It simultaneously halves the usage of annotation data and reduces total training time by up to two thirds.

Using 22 language models, we construct a large-scale knowledge base of political position predictions for 23,228 arguments drawn from 30 debates that appeared on the UK politicial television programme \\textit{Question Time}.

However, applying advanced deep learning models in challenging, volatile domains like finance is difficult due to the inherent limitation and dynamic nature of financial time series data. This scarcity often results in sub-optimal model training and poor generalization. The fundamental challenge lies in determining how to reliably augment scarce financial time series data to enhance the predictive accuracy of deep learning forecasting models. Our main contribution is a demonstration of how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can effectively serve as a data augmentation tool to overcome data scarcity in the financial domain. Specifically, we show that training a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) forecasting model on a dataset augmented with synthetic data generated by a transformer-based GAN (TTS-GAN) significantly improves the forecasting accuracy compared to using real data alone. We confirm these results across different financial time series (Bitcoin and S\\&P500 price data) and various forecasting horizons. Furthermore, we propose a novel, time series specific quality metric that combines Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and a modified Deep Dataset Dissimilarity Measure (DeD-iMs) to reliably monitor the training progress and evaluate the quality of the generated data. These findings provide compelling evidence for the benefits of GAN-based data augmentation in enhancing financial predictive capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose Grassmannian MoE (GrMoE), a routing framework that operates on the Grassmannian manifold of subspaces, where gating weights arise from the concentration parameters of Matrix Bingham distributions. This construction yields a single, interpretable knob -- the concentration matrix $\u039b$ -- that continuously controls routing entropy, replacing discrete top-$k$ selection with a smooth, geometrically principled sparsity mechanism. We further develop an amortized variational inference procedure for posterior routing distributions, enabling uncertainty-aware expert assignment that naturally resists expert collapse.

To address this, we introduce VIRAASAT, a novel, semi-automated multi-hop approach for generating cultural specific multi-hop Question-Answering dataset for Indian culture. VIRAASAT leverages a Knowledge Graph comprising more than 700 expert-curated cultural artifacts, covering 13 key attributes of Indian culture (history, festivals, etc).

Traditional approaches often fail to produce generalized and interpretable explanations, as multiple distinct input trajectories may yield nearly indistinguishable outputs. In this work, we present ruleXplain, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract formal explanations for input-output relations in simulation-driven dynamical systems. Our method introduces a constrained symbolic rule language with temporal operators and delay semantics, enabling LLMs to generate verifiable causal rules through structured prompting. ruleXplain relies on the availability of a principled model (e.g., a simulator) that maps multivariate input time series to output time series. Within ruleXplain, the simulator is used to generate diverse counterfactual input trajectories that yield similar target output, serving as candidate explanations. Such counterfactual inputs are clustered and provided as context to the LLM, which is tasked with the generation of symbolic rules encoding the joint temporal trends responsible for the patterns observable in the output times series. A closed-loop refinement process ensures rule consistency and semantic validity. We validate the framework using the PySIRTEM epidemic simulator, mapping testing rate inputs to daily infection counts; and the EnergyPlus building energy simulator, observing temperature and solar irradiance inputs to electricity needs. For validation, we perform three classes of experiments: (1) the efficacy of the ruleset through input reconstruction; (2) ablation studies evaluating the causal encoding of the ruleset; and (3) generalization tests of the extracted rules across unseen output trends with varying phase dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "ruleXplain\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528LLMs\u4ece\u6a21\u62df\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u56e0\u679c\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u65ad\u5177\u6709\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u5e95\u5c42\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u590d\u6742\u7684\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u52a8\u6001\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u6765\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u666e\u904d\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u8f68\u8ff9\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "method": "ruleXplain\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4ece\u6a21\u62df\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5f62\u5f0f\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ea6\u675f\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5219\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4f7fLLMs\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u89c4\u5219\u3002ruleXplain\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u591a\u5143\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u8f93\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u5728ruleXplain\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u4ea7\u751f\u7c7b\u4f3c\u76ee\u6807\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8f93\u5165\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5019\u9009\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8f93\u5165\u88ab\u805a\u7c7b\u5e76\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed9LLM\uff0cLLM\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u662f\u751f\u6210\u7f16\u7801\u8f93\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8d23\u4efb\u6027\u8054\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u8d8b\u52bf\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5219\u3002\u95ed\u73af\u7cbe\u70bc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u786e\u4fdd\u89c4\u5219\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528PySIRTEM\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5c06\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7387\u8f93\u5165\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6bcf\u65e5\u611f\u67d3\u8ba1\u6570\uff1b\u4ee5\u53caEnergyPlus\u5efa\u7b51\u80fd\u6e90\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u592a\u9633\u8f90\u5c04\u8f93\u5165\u5230\u7535\u529b\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a(1)\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u91cd\u5efa\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c4\u5219\u96c6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b(2)\u6d88\u9664\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c4\u5219\u96c6\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7f16\u7801\uff1b(3)\u8de8\u672a\u89c1\u8f93\u51fa\u8d8b\u52bf\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u89c4\u5219\u6cdb\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d8b\u52bf\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u76f8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "conclusion": "ruleXplain\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4ece\u6a21\u62df\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u56e0\u679c\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, in real-world scenarios, it is often impractical to expect that all data processed by an AI system satisfy this assumption. Furthermore, failure to appropriately handle out-of-distribution (OOD) objects may introduce safety risks in real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving or medical assistance). Unfortunately, current research has not yet provided valid benchmarks that can comprehensively assess the performance of VLMs in response to OOD data. Therefore, we propose OODBench, a predominantly automated method with minimal human verification, for constructing new benchmarks and evaluating the ability of VLMs to process OOD data. OODBench contains 40K instance-level OOD instance-category pairs, and we show that current VLMs still exhibit notable performance degradation on OODBench, even when the underlying image categories are common. In addition, we propose a reliable automated assessment metric that employs a Basic-to-Advanced Progression of prompted questions to assess the impact of OOD data on questions of varying difficulty more fully.

However, the investigation of machine learning predictions applied to prospectively collected, standardized data from observational clinical intervention trials remains underexplored, despite its potential to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), a persistent inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses lasting more than three months, imposes a substantial burden on quality of life (QoL) and societal cost. Although many patients respond to medical therapy, others with refractory symptoms often pursue surgical intervention. Surgical decision-making in CRS is complex, as it must weigh known procedural risks against uncertain individualized outcomes. In this study, we evaluated supervised machine learning models for predicting surgical benefit in CRS, using the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) as the primary patient-reported outcome. Our prospectively collected cohort from an observational intervention trial comprised patients who all underwent surgery; we investigated whether models trained only on preoperative data could identify patients who might not have been recommended surgery prior to the procedure. Across multiple algorithms, including an ensemble approach, our best model achieved approximately 85% classification accuracy, providing accurate and interpretable predictions of surgical candidacy. Moreover, on a held-out set of 30 cases spanning mixed difficulty, our model achieved 80% accuracy, exceeding the average prediction accuracy of expert clinicians (75.6%), demonstrating its potential to augment clinical decision-making and support personalized CRS care.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4bCRS\u624b\u672f\u53d7\u76ca\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u51cf\u5c11\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6539\u5584\u60a3\u8005\u9884\u540e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4bCRS\u624b\u672f\u53d7\u76ca\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SNOT-22\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u60a3\u8005\u62a5\u544a\u7ed3\u679c", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea685%\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u572830\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523080%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0875.6%\uff09", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4bCRS\u624b\u672f\u53d7\u76ca\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684CRS\u62a4\u7406"}}

However, conventional parametric policies often struggle to represent the multi-modality of the solutions. Though diffusion-based policies are aimed at recovering the multi-modality, they lack an explicit probability density, which complicates policy-gradient optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose MePoly, a novel policy parameterization based on polynomial energy-based models.

Understanding the mechanisms governing when memorization versus generalization occurs remains an active area of research. In particular, it is unclear where along the noise schedule memorization is induced, how data geometry influences it, and how phenomena at different noise scales interact. We introduce a geometric framework that partitions the noise schedule into three regimes based on the coverage properties of training data by Gaussian shells and the concentration behavior of the posterior, which we argue are two fundamental objects governing memorization and generalization in diffusion models. This perspective reveals that memorization risk is highly non-uniform across noise levels. We further identify a danger zone at medium noise levels where memorization is most pronounced. In contrast, both the small and large noise regimes resist memorization, but through fundamentally different mechanisms: small noise avoids memorization due to limited training coverage, while large noise exhibits low posterior concentration and admits a provably near linear Gaussian denoising behavior. For the medium noise regime, we identify geometric conditions through which we propose a geometry-informed targeted intervention that mitigates memorization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we introduce the Distortion-aware Motion Calibrator (DMC), a post-hoc module that refines physically implausible motions (e.g., foot floating) while preserving semantic consistency with the original textual description. Rather than relying on complex physical modeling, we propose a self-supervised and data-driven approach, whereby DMC learns to obtain physically plausible motions when an intentionally distorted motion and the original textual descriptions are given as inputs. We evaluate DMC as a post-hoc module to improve motions obtained from various text-to-motion generation models and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving physical plausibility while enhancing semantic consistency. The experimental results show that DMC reduces FID score by 42.74% on T2M and 13.20% on T2M-GPT, while also achieving the highest R-Precision. When applied to high-quality models like MoMask, DMC improves the physical plausibility of motions by reducing penetration by 33.0% as well as adjusting floating artifacts closer to the ground-truth reference. These results highlight that DMC can serve as a promising post-hoc motion refinement framework for any kind of text-to-motion models by incorporating textual semantics and physical plausibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Universal codes e.g., Exponential-Golomb codes are faster to decode but do not exploit the symbol frequency distributions. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Dual Length Codes, a hybrid approach designed to balance compression efficiency with decoding speed. Analyzing BFloat16 tensors from the Gemma model, we observed that the top 8 most frequent symbols account for approximately 50% of the cumulative probability. These 8 symbols are assigned a short 4 bit code. The remaining 248 symbols are assigned a longer 9 bit code. The coding scheme uses a single prefix bit to distinguish between the two code lengths. The scheme uses a small Look Up Table with only 8 entries for encoding and decoding. The scheme achieves a compressibility of 18.6% in comparison to 21.3% achieved by Huffman codes, but it significantly speeds up the decoding and simplifies the hardware complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Ours being the first work studying this topic, we first formulate attacks that aim to perturb the features extracted by discrete tokenizers, and thus change the extracted tokens. These attacks are computationally efficient, application-agnostic, and effective across classification, multimodal retrieval, and captioning tasks. Second, to defend against this vulnerability, inspired by recent work on robust CLIP encoders, we fine-tune popular tokenizers with unsupervised adversarial training, keeping all other components frozen. While unsupervised and task-agnostic, our approach significantly improves robustness to both unsupervised and end-to-end supervised attacks and generalizes well to unseen tasks and data.

However, existing approaches still face challenges in fine-grained semantic understanding, particularly when dealing with complex textual descriptions. To overcome these limitations, we propose DEIG, a novel framework for fine-grained and controllable multi-instance generation. DEIG integrates an Instance Detail Extractor (IDE) that transforms text encoder embeddings into compact, instance-aware representations, and a Detail Fusion Module (DFM) that applies instance-based masked attention to prevent attribute leakage across instances. These components enable DEIG to generate visually coherent multi-instance scenes that precisely match rich, localized textual descriptions.

Effectively combining textual and visual modalities requires adherence to the sketch visual structure when leveraging the guidance of localized attributes from text. We present LOcalized Text and Sketch with multi-level guidance (LOTS), a framework that enhances fashion image generation by combining global sketch guidance with multiple localized sketch-text pairs. LOTS employs a Multi-level Conditioning Stage to independently encode local features within a shared latent space while maintaining global structural coordination. Then, the Diffusion Pair Guidance stage integrates both local and global conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's multi-step denoising process. To validate our method, we develop Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs are provided per image. Sketchy provides high-quality, clean sketches with a professional look and consistent structure. To assess robustness beyond this setting, we also include an \"in the wild\" split with non-expert sketches, featuring higher variability and imperfections.

Recent methods achieve dense reconstructions from da Vinci robotic surgery videos, with Gaussian Splatting (GS) offering real-time performance via graphics acceleration. However, reconstruction quality in occluded regions remains limited, and depth accuracy has not been fully assessed, as benchmarks like EndoNeRF and StereoMIS lack 3D ground truth. We propose Diff2DGS, a novel two-stage framework for reliable 3D reconstruction of occluded surgical scenes. In the first stage, a diffusion-based video module with temporal priors inpaints tissue occluded by instruments with high spatial-temporal consistency. In the second stage, we adapt 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with a Learnable Deformation Model (LDM) to capture dynamic tissue deformation and anatomical geometry. We also extend evaluation beyond prior image-quality metrics by performing quantitative depth accuracy analysis on the SCARED dataset. Diff2DGS outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both appearance and geometry, reaching 38.02 dB PSNR on EndoNeRF and 34.40 dB on StereoMIS. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that optimizing for image quality alone does not necessarily translate into optimal 3D reconstruction accuracy.

Feature visualization, which optimizes inputs to maximally activate a target direction, offers an alternative to costly dataset search approaches, but remains underexplored for LLMs due to the discrete nature of text. Furthermore, existing prompt optimization techniques are poorly suited to this domain, which is highly prone to local minima. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ADAPT, a hybrid method combining beam search initialization with adaptive gradient-guided mutation, designed around these failure modes. We evaluate on Sparse Autoencoder latents from Gemma 2 2B, proposing metrics grounded in dataset activation statistics to enable rigorous comparison, and show that ADAPT consistently outperforms prior methods across layers and latent types.

In safety-critical settings, it is therefore insufficient to produce predictions without assessing whether the input remains within the detector's nominal operating regime. We refer to this capability as self-aware object detection.\n  We introduce a degradation-aware self-awareness framework based on degradation manifolds, which explicitly structure a detector's feature space according to image degradation rather than semantic content. Our method augments a standard detection backbone with a lightweight embedding head trained via multi-layer contrastive learning. Images sharing the same degradation composition are pulled together, while differing degradation configurations are pushed apart, yielding a geometrically organized representation that captures degradation type and severity without requiring degradation labels or explicit density modeling.\n  To anchor the learned geometry, we estimate a pristine prototype from clean training embeddings, defining a nominal operating point in representation space. Self-awareness emerges as geometric deviation from this reference, providing an intrinsic, image-level signal of degradation-induced shift that is independent of detection confidence.\n  Extensive experiments on synthetic corruption benchmarks, cross-dataset zero-shot transfer, and natural weather-induced distribution shifts demonstrate strong pristine-degraded separability, consistent behavior across multiple detector architectures, and robust generalization under semantic shift. These results suggest that degradation-aware representation geometry provides a practical and detector-agnostic foundation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9000\u5316\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u611f\u77e5\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u6355\u6349\u9000\u5316\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u6211\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9000\u5316\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c42\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5d4c\u5165\u5934\uff0c\u5c06\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u9000\u5316\u6210\u5206\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u62c9\u8fd1\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u9000\u5316\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u5f00\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u9000\u5316\u6807\u7b7e\u6216\u663e\u5f0f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u9000\u5316\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u635f\u574f\u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u5929\u6c14\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u539f\u59cb-\u9000\u5316\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u3001\u8de8\u591a\u4e2a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9000\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u793a\u51e0\u4f55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u4e14\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

A common problem is reward hacking, where the policy may exploit inaccuracies of the reward and learn an unintended behavior. Most previous works address this by limiting the policy update with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) penalty towards a reference model. We propose a different framing: Train the LM in a way that biases policy updates towards regions in which the reward is more accurate. First, we derive a theoretical connection between the accuracy of a reward model and the flatness of an optimum at convergence. Gradient regularization (GR) can then be used to bias training to flatter regions and thereby maintain reward model accuracy. We confirm these results by showing that the gradient norm and reward accuracy are empirically correlated in RLHF. We then show that Reference Resets of the KL penalty implicitly use GR to find flatter regions with higher reward accuracy. We further improve on this by proposing to use explicit GR with an efficient finite-difference estimate. Empirically, GR performs better than a KL penalty across a diverse set of RL experiments with LMs. GR achieves a higher GPT-judged win-rate in RLHF, avoids overly focusing on the format in rule-based math rewards, and prevents hacking the judge in LLM-as-a-Judge math tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff08GR\uff09\u63d0\u9ad8RLHF\u4e2d\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u975e\u9884\u671f\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\uff08RLHF\uff09\u6216\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\uff08RLVR\uff09\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LM\uff09\u7684\u540e\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u975e\u9884\u671f\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LM\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u504f\u5411\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u65f6\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u5e73\u5766\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff08GR\uff09\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u504f\u5411\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e73\u5766\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7ef4\u6301\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5728RLHF\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u91cd\u7f6e\u7684KL\u60e9\u7f5a\u9690\u5f0f\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86GR\u6765\u627e\u5230\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u5766\u533a\u57df\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u5f0fGR\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2aRL\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cGR\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eKL\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002GR\u5728RLHF\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684GPT\u8bc4\u5224\u80dc\u7387\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5956\u52b1\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u9632\u6b62\u4e86\u5728LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u88c1\u5224\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9ed1\u5ba2\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u68af\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff08GR\uff09\u5728RLHF\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8eKL\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u9632\u6b62\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u975e\u9884\u671f\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

In this paper, we use information-theoretic analysis to show that non-zero mutual information between CoT and output is a necessary but not sufficient condition for CoT monitorability. We identify two sources of approximation error that may undermine the performance of CoT monitors in practice: information gap, which measures the extent to which the monitor can extract the information available in CoT, and elicitation error, which measures the extent to which the monitor approximates the optimal monitoring function. We further demonstrate that CoT monitorability can be systematically improved through targeted training objectives. To this end, we propose two complementary approaches: (a) an oracle-based method that directly rewards the monitored model for producing CoTs that maximize monitor accuracy, and (b) a more practical, label-free approach that maximizes conditional mutual information between outputs and CoTs.

Although this has led to significant progress in domains such as robotics, healthcare, and finance, the use of RL in practice is challenging, particularly when learning decision policies in high-stakes applications that may require guarantees. Traditional RL algorithms rely on a large number of online interactions with the environment, which is problematic in scenarios where online interactions are costly, dangerous, or infeasible. However, learning from offline datasets is hindered by the presence of hidden confounders. Such confounders can cause spurious correlations in the dataset and can mislead the agent into taking suboptimal or adversarial actions. Firstly, we address the problem of learning from offline datasets in the presence of hidden confounders. We work with instrumental variables (IVs) to identify the causal effect, which is an instance of a conditional moment restrictions (CMR) problem. Inspired by double/debiased machine learning, we derive a sample-efficient algorithm for solving CMR problems with convergence and optimality guarantees, which outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. Secondly, we relax the conditions on the hidden confounders in the setting of (offline) imitation learning, and adapt our CMR estimator to derive an algorithm that can learn effective imitator policies with convergence rate guarantees. Finally, we consider the problem of learning high-level objectives expressed in linear temporal logic (LTL) and develop a provably optimal learning algorithm that improves sample efficiency over existing methods.

A common but poorly understood phenomenon during training is the PCC plateau: PCC stops improving early in training, even as MSE continues to decrease. We provide the first rigorous theoretical analysis of this behavior, revealing fundamental limitations in both optimization dynamics and model capacity. First, in regard to the flattened PCC curve, we uncover a critical conflict where lowering MSE (magnitude matching) can paradoxically suppress the PCC gradient (shape matching). This issue is exacerbated by the softmax attention mechanism, particularly when the data to be aggregated is highly homogeneous. Second, we identify a limitation in the model capacity: we derived a PCC improvement limit for any convex aggregator (including the softmax attention), showing that the convex hull of the inputs strictly bounds the achievable PCC gain. We demonstrate that data homogeneity intensifies both limitations. Motivated by these insights, we propose the Extrapolative Correlation Attention (ECA), which incorporates novel, theoretically-motivated mechanisms to improve the PCC optimization and extrapolate beyond the convex hull. Across diverse benchmarks, including challenging homogeneous data setting, ECA consistently breaks the PCC plateau, achieving significant improvements in correlation without compromising MSE performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faECA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2dPCC\u635f\u5931\u63d0\u5347\u505c\u6ede\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2dPCC\uff08\u76ae\u5c14\u900a\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\uff09\u635f\u5931\u63d0\u5347\u505c\u6ede\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ECA\uff08\u5916\u63a8\u76f8\u5173\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86PCC\u635f\u5931\u63d0\u5347\u505c\u6ede\u7684\u5185\u5728\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ECA\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "ECA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684PCC\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86MSE\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ECA\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3PCC\u635f\u5931\u63d0\u5347\u505c\u6ede\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Recent work, Exploring the Latent Capacity of LLMs for One-Step Text Reconstruction (Mezentsev and Oseledets), shows that frozen LLMs can reconstruct hundreds of tokens from only two learned proto-tokens in a single forward pass, suggesting a path beyond the autoregressive paradigm. In this paper, we study what information these proto-tokens encode and how they behave under reconstruction and controlled constraints. We perform a series of experiments aimed at disentangling semantic and syntactic content in the two proto-tokens, analyzing stability properties of the e-token, and visualizing attention patterns to the e-token during reconstruction. Finally, we test two regularization schemes for \"imposing\" semantic structure on the e-token using teacher embeddings, including an anchor-based loss and a relational distillation objective. Our results indicate that the m-token tends to capture semantic information more strongly than the e-token under standard optimization; anchor-based constraints trade off sharply with reconstruction accuracy; and relational distillation can transfer batch-level semantic relations into the proto-token space without sacrificing reconstruction quality, supporting the feasibility of future non-autoregressive seq2seq systems that predict proto-tokens as an intermediate representation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u539f\u578btoken\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5728\u975e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52seq2seq\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u4e2d\u539f\u578btoken\u6240\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u53d7\u63a7\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u3001e-token\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3001\u91cd\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u6559\u5e08\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u6d4b\u8bd5", "result": "m-token\u6bd4e-token\u66f4\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u951a\u70b9\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6210\u9c9c\u660e\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u5173\u7cfb\u84b8\u998f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u6279\u91cf\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u539f\u578btoken\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u727a\u7272\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf", "conclusion": "\u652f\u6301\u672a\u6765\u975e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52seq2seq\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u539f\u578btoken\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027"}}

This semi-adversarial setting naturally sits between the classical stochastic case with i.i.d.\\ instances for which function classes with finite VC dimension are learnable; and the adversarial case with arbitrary instances, known to be significantly more restrictive. For this problem, Goel et al. (2023) showed that, if the learner knows the distribution $\u03bc$ of clean samples in advance, learning can be achieved for all VC classes without restrictions on adversary corruptions. This is, however, a strong assumption in both theory and practice: a natural question is whether similar learning guarantees can be achieved without prior distributional knowledge, as is standard in classical learning frameworks (e.g., PAC learning or asymptotic consistency) and other non-i.i.d.\\ models (e.g., smoothed online learning). We therefore focus on the distribution-free setting where $\u03bc$ is \\emph{unknown} and propose an algorithm \\textsc{AbstainBoost} based on a boosting procedure of weak learners, which guarantees sublinear error for general VC classes in \\emph{distribution-free} abstention learning for oblivious adversaries. These algorithms also enjoy similar guarantees for adaptive adversaries, for structured function classes including linear classifiers. These results are complemented with corresponding lower bounds, which reveal an interesting polynomial trade-off between misclassification error and number of erroneous abstentions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Across thirteen q-only benchmarks spanning mechanical, electrical, molecular, thermal, gravitational, and ecological systems, PHAST achieves the best long-horizon forecasting among competitive baselines and enables physically meaningful parameter recovery when the regime provides sufficient anchors. We show that identification is fundamentally ill-posed without such anchors (gauge freedom), motivating a two-axis evaluation that separates forecasting stability from identifiability.", "AI": {"tldr": "PHAST\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8017\u6563\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u8017\u6563\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPHAST\uff08Port-Hamiltonian Architecture for Structured Temporal dynamics\uff09\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u52bf\u80fd\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u963b\u5c3c\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9PSD/SPD\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5df2\u77e5\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u3001\u672a\u77e5\uff09\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8de8\u8d8a\u673a\u68b0\u3001\u7535\u6c14\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u3001\u70ed\u3001\u91cd\u529b\u548c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u7cfb\u7edf\u768413\u4e2aq-only\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPHAST\u5728\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ade\u4e89\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u8db3\u591f\u951a\u70b9\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6062\u590d\u3002", "conclusion": "PHAST\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u8017\u6563\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u8db3\u591f\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\u6062\u590d\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u3002"}}

Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on key-value caching to accumulate frame-level information over time, but use a limited number of tokens per frame, leading to the loss of fine-grained visual details. In this work, we propose scaling the token budget to enable more granular spatiotemporal understanding and reasoning. First, we find that current methods are ill-equipped to handle dense streams: their feature encoding causes query-frame similarity scores to increase over time, biasing retrieval toward later frames. To address this, we introduce an adaptive selection strategy that reduces token redundancy while preserving local spatiotemporal information. We further propose a training-free retrieval mixture-of-experts that leverages external models to better identify relevant frames.

To address this issue, we conduct a bias-variance decomposition for hypergradient estimation error and provide a supplemental detailed analysis of the variance term ignored by previous works. We also present a comprehensive analysis of the error bounds for hypergradient estimation. This facilitates an easy explanation of some phenomena commonly observed in practice, like overfitting to the validation set. Inspired by the derived theories, we propose an ensemble hypergradient strategy to reduce the variance in HPO algorithms effectively. Experimental results on tasks including regularization hyperparameter learning, data hyper-cleaning, and few-shot learning demonstrate that our variance reduction strategy improves hypergradient estimation.

While recent work suggests that high-dimensional concentration allows these models to implicitly estimate noise levels from corrupted observations, a fundamental paradox remains: what is the underlying landscape being optimized when the noise level is treated as a random variable, and how can a bounded, noise-agnostic network remain stable near the data manifold where gradients typically diverge? We resolve this paradox by formalizing Marginal Energy, $E_{\\text{marg}}(\\mathbf{u}) = -\\log p(\\mathbf{u})$, where $p(\\mathbf{u}) = \\int p(\\mathbf{u}|t)p(t)dt$ is the marginal density of the noisy data integrated over a prior distribution of unknown noise levels. We prove that generation using autonomous models is not merely blind denoising, but a specific form of Riemannian gradient flow on this Marginal Energy. Through a novel relative energy decomposition, we demonstrate that while the raw Marginal Energy landscape possesses a $1/t^p$ singularity normal to the data manifold, the learned time-invariant field implicitly incorporates a local conformal metric that perfectly counteracts the geometric singularity, converting an infinitely deep potential well into a stable attractor. We also establish the structural stability conditions for sampling with autonomous models. We identify a ``Jensen Gap'' in noise-prediction parameterizations that acts as a high-gain amplifier for estimation errors, explaining the catastrophic failure observed in deterministic blind models. Conversely, we prove that velocity-based parameterizations are inherently stable because they satisfy a bounded-gain condition that absorbs posterior uncertainty into a smooth geometric drift.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, this accuracy gain comes at the cost of reduced robustness against iterative white-box attacks. By employing a test-time \\emph{mask projection} that resets the inserted auxiliary pixels to their training values, we demonstrate that the vulnerability stems almost entirely from the inserted dimensions.

Inspired by the principle of \\emph{symmetry breaking} in physics, this paper proposes a hardware-friendly approach for function approximation through \\emph{input-space expansion}. The core idea involves augmenting the original one-dimensional input (e.g., $x$) with constant values (e.g., $\u03c0$) to form a higher-dimensional vector (e.g., $[\u03c0, \u03c0, x, \u03c0, \u03c0]$), effectively breaking parameter symmetries without increasing the network's parameter count. We evaluate the method on ten representative one-dimensional functions, including smooth, discontinuous, high-frequency, and non-differentiable functions. Experimental results demonstrate that input-space expansion significantly accelerates training convergence (reducing LBFGS iterations by 12\\% on average) and enhances approximation accuracy (reducing final MSE by 66.3\\% for the optimal 5D expansion).

We used a shared set of clinical and DXA-derived features across three large cohorts - the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS), and the UK Biobank (UKB), to systematically evaluate the performance of three domain adaptation methods - Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Correlation Alignment (CORAL), and Domain - Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) and their combinations. For a source cohort with males only and a source cohort with females only, domain-adaptation methods consistently showed improved performance than the no-adaptation baseline (source-only training), and the use of combinations of multiple domain adaptation methods delivered the largest and most stable gains. The method that combines MMD, CORAL, and DANN achieved the highest discrimination with the area under curve (AUC) of 0.88 for a source cohort with males only and 0.95 for a source cohort with females only), demonstrating that integrating multiple domain adaptation methods could produce feature representations that are less sensitive to dataset differences.

However, traditional IRT describes a model's success on a task as a monotonic function of model capabilities and task demands, an approach unsuited to propensities, where both excess and deficiency can be problematic. Here, we introduce the first formal framework for measuring AI propensities by using a bilogistic formulation for model success, which attributes high success probability when the model's propensity is within an \"ideal band\". Further, we estimate the limits of the ideal band using LLMs equipped with newly developed task-agnostic rubrics. Applying our framework to six families of LLM models whose propensities are incited in either direction, we find that we can measure how much the propensity is shifted and what effect this has on the tasks. Critically, propensities estimated using one benchmark successfully predict behaviour on held-out tasks.

To address these limitations, we propose LERD, an end-to-end Bayesian electrophysiological neural dynamical system that infers latent neural events and their relational structure directly from multichannel EEG without event or interaction annotations. LERD combines a continuous-time event inference module with a stochastic event-generation process to capture flexible temporal patterns, while incorporating an electrophysiology-inspired dynamical prior to guide learning in a principled way. We further provide theoretical analysis that yields a tractable bound for training and stability guarantees for the inferred relational dynamics.

One of the challenges is that learning new tasks inevitably destroys the learned knowledge. Beyond traditional catastrophic forgetting, Dual-to-Dual MLLMs face other challenges, including hallucination, instruction unfollowing, and failures in cross-modal knowledge transfer.

This single template recovers greedy decoding, Softmax sampling, Top-K, Top-P, and Sparsemax-style sparsity as special cases, and explains their common structure through optimality conditions. More importantly, the framework makes it easy to invent new decoders without folklore. We demonstrate this by designing Best-of-K (BoK), a KL-anchored coverage objective aimed at multi-sample pipelines (self-consistency, reranking, verifier selection). BoK targets the probability of covering good alternatives within a fixed K-sample budget and improves empirical performance.

Specifically, we start from an equivariant discrete flow-matching model, and relax its equivariance during training via a controllable symmetry modulation scheme based on sinusoidal positional encodings and node permutations.

To address these challenges, we propose JPmHC (Jacobian-spectrum Preserving manifold-constrained Hyper-Connections), a framework that replaces identity skips with a trainable linear mixer acting on n parallel streams while explicitly controlling gradient conditioning. By constraining the mixer M on operator-norm-bounded manifolds (e.g., bistochastic, Stiefel, Grassmann), JPmHC prevents gradient pathologies and enhances stability. JPmHC introduces three key contributions: (i) a free-probability analysis that predicts Jacobian spectra for structured skips, providing actionable design rules for mixer selection; (ii) memory-efficient implicit differentiation for fixed-point projections, reducing activation memory and synchronization overhead; and (iii) a Stiefel-constrained mixer via Cayley transforms, ensuring orthogonality without post-hoc normalization.

In this problem, a decision-maker must allocate multiple types of resources to sequentially arriving queries over a finite horizon. Each query belongs to a finite set of types with fixed resource consumption and a stochastic reward drawn from an unknown, type-specific distribution. Critically, the environment exhibits arbitrary non-stationarity -- arrival distributions may shift unpredictably-while the algorithm requires only one historical sample per period to operate effectively. We distinguish two settings based on sample informativeness: (i) reward-observed samples containing both query type and reward realization, and (ii) the more challenging type-only samples revealing only query type information.\n  We propose a novel type-dependent quantile-based meta-policy that decouples the problem into modular components: reward distribution estimation, optimization of target service probabilities via fluid relaxation, and real-time decisions through dynamic acceptance thresholds. For reward-observed samples, our static threshold policy achieves $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret. For type-only samples, we first establish that sublinear regret is impossible without additional structure; under a mild minimum-arrival-probability assumption, we design both a partially adaptive policy attaining the same $\\tilde{O}({T})$ bound and, more significantly, a fully adaptive resolving policy with careful rounding that achieves the first poly-logarithmic regret guarantee of $O((\\log T)^3)$ for non-stationary multi-resource allocation.

Prior studies have examined these explanations in different contexts, such as non-probabilistic versus probabilistic frameworks and local versus global settings. In this study, we introduce a unified framework for analyzing these explanations, demonstrating that they can all be characterized through the minimization of a unified probabilistic value function. We then prove that the complexity of these computations is influenced by three key properties of the value function: (1) *monotonicity*, (2) *submodularity*, and (3) *supermodularity* - which are three fundamental properties in *combinatorial optimization*. Our findings uncover some counterintuitive results regarding the nature of these properties within the explanation settings examined. For instance, although the *local* value functions do not exhibit monotonicity or submodularity/supermodularity whatsoever, we demonstrate that the *global* value functions do possess these properties. This distinction enables us to prove a series of novel polynomial-time results for computing various explanations with provable guarantees in the global explainability setting, across a range of ML models that span the interpretability spectrum, such as neural networks, decision trees, and tree ensembles. In contrast, we show that even highly simplified versions of these explanations become NP-hard to compute in the corresponding local explainability setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Traditional gossip-based methods suffer from message communication costs that grow with model size, while information decay over network hops renders global consensus inefficient. SeedFlood departs from these practices by exploiting the seed-reconstructible structure of zeroth-order updates and effectively making the messages near-zero in size, allowing them to be flooded to every client in the network. This mechanism makes communication overhead negligible and independent of model size, removing the primary scalability bottleneck in decentralized training. Consequently, SeedFlood enables training in regimes previously considered impractical, such as billion-parameter models distributed across hundreds of clients.

Each neuron parameterizes a posterior, propagates a reparameterized sample and is regularized by the KL term of a local ELBO - hence, the activation is distributional. This \"contraction\" becomes testable through local constraints and can be monitored via internal measures. The amount of contextual information carried by the unit, as well as the temporal persistence of this information, are locally tuned by distinct constraints. This proposal addresses a structural tension: in sequential generation, causality is predominantly organized in the symbolic space and, even when latents exist, they often remain auxiliary, while the effective dynamics are carried by a largely deterministic decoder. In parallel, probabilistic latent models capture factors of variation and uncertainty, but that uncertainty typically remains borne by global or parametric mechanisms, while units continue to propagate scalars - hence the pivot question: if uncertainty is intrinsic to computation, why does the compute unit not carry it explicitly? We therefore draw two axes: (i) the composition of probabilistic constraints, which must be made stable, interpretable and controllable; and (ii) granularity: if inference is a negotiation of distributions under constraints, should the primitive unit remain deterministic or become distributional? We analyze \"collapse\" modes and the conditions for a \"living neuron\", then extend the contribution over time via autoregressive priors over the latent, per unit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u5206\u5e03\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u5f0f\u643a\u5e26\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u5143\u672a\u80fd\u663e\u5f0f\u643a\u5e26\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\u7816\u5757\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u8be5\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5177\u6709\u5148\u9a8c\u3001\u8fd1\u4f3c\u540e\u9a8c\u548c\u5c40\u90e8ELBO\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u5ea6\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u76d1\u63a7\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u643a\u5e26\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5148\u9a8c\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u6269\u5c55\u5176\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u5143\u672a\u80fd\u663e\u5f0f\u643a\u5e26\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002"}}

While these systems often achieve strong performance, their recommendations are often difficult to justify: the influence of dataset meta-features on algorithm and hyperparameter choices is typically not exposed, limiting reliability, bias diagnostics, and efficient meta-feature engineering. This limits reliability and diagnostic insight for further improvements. In this work, we investigate the explainability of the meta-models in AutoClustering. We first review 22 existing methods and organize their meta-features into a structured taxonomy. We then apply a global explainability technique (i.e., Decision Predicate Graphs) to assess feature importance within meta-models from selected frameworks. Finally, we use local explainability tools such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to analyse specific clustering decisions. Our findings highlight consistent patterns in meta-feature relevance, identify structural weaknesses in current meta-learning strategies that can distort recommendations, and provide actionable guidance for more interpretable Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) design.

Conventional machine learning approaches, such as Support Vector Machines, variants of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and tree-based methods like Random Forests, Extra Tree Regressors, and XGBoost, can capture nonlinearities but often struggle to respect the fundamental propeller law relationship between power and speed, resulting in poor extrapolation outside the training envelope. This study introduces a hybrid modeling framework that integrates physics-based knowledge from sea trials with data-driven residual learning. The baseline component, derived from calm-water power curves of the form $P = cV^n$, captures the dominant power-speed dependence, while another, nonlinear, regressor is then trained to predict the residual power, representing deviations caused by environmental and operational conditions. By constraining the machine learning task to residual corrections, the hybrid model simplifies learning, improves generalization, and ensures consistency with the underlying physics. In this study, an XGBoost, a simple Neural Network, and a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) coupled with the baseline component were compared to identical models without the baseline component. Validation on in-service data demonstrates that the hybrid model consistently outperformed a pure data-driven baseline in sparse data regions while maintaining similar performance in populated ones.

This assignment-level instability can undermine both accuracy and robustness. Ensemble approaches improve global consistency by aggregating multiple runs, but they typically lack tools for quantifying pointwise confidence in a way that combines cross-run agreement with geometric support from the learned cluster structure. We introduce CAKE (Confidence in Assignments via K-partition Ensembles), a framework that evaluates each point using two complementary statistics computed over a clustering ensemble: assignment stability and consistency of local geometric fit. These are combined into a single, interpretable score in [0,1]. Our theoretical analysis shows that CAKE remains effective under noise and separates stable from unstable points.
