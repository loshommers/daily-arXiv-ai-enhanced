Standard BO models the process as a black box and ignores the intermediate observations and the underlying process structure. Partially Observable Gaussian Process Networks (POGPN) model the process as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). However, using intermediate observations is challenging when the observations are high-dimensional state-space time series. Process-expert knowledge can be used to extract low-dimensional latent features from the high-dimensional state-space data. We propose POGPN-JPSS, a framework that combines POGPN with Joint Parameter and State-Space (JPSS) modeling to use intermediate extracted information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of POGPN-JPSS on a challenging, high-dimensional simulation of a multi-stage bioethanol production process. Our results show that POGPN-JPSS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving the desired performance threshold twice as fast and with greater reliability.

To combine the advantages of both, we propose BioBridge, a domain-adaptive continual pretraining framework for protein understanding. This framework employs Domain-Incremental Continual Pre-training (DICP) to infuse protein domain knowledge and general reasoning corpus into a LLM simultaneously, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Cross-modal alignment is achieved via a PLM-Projector-LLM pipeline, which maps protein sequence embeddings into the semantic space of the language model. Ultimately, an end-to-end optimization is adopted to uniformly support various tasks, including protein property prediction and knowledge question-answering. Our proposed BioBridge demonstrates performance comparable to that of mainstream PLMs on multiple protein benchmarks, such as EC and BindingDB.

In contrast, Across remains robust in all tested configurations due to low solver margins and very high liquidity, while Mayan Swift is generally secure but becomes vulnerable under stress-test conditions.

Recent studies have shown that applying invertible transformations to activations can significantly improve quantization robustness by reducing activation outliers; however, existing approaches are largely restricted to rotation or Hadamard-based transformations. Moreover, most studies focused primarily on traditional quantization schemes, whereas modern hardware increasingly supports the microscaling (MX) data format. Attempts to combine both showed severe performance degradation, leading prior work to introduce assumptions on the transformations. In this work, we take a complementary perspective. First, we provide a theoretical analysis of transformations under MX quantization by deriving a bound on the quantization error. Our analysis emphasizes the importance of accounting for both the activation distribution and the underlying quantization structure. Building on this analysis, we propose LATMiX, a method that generalizes outlier reduction to learnable invertible affine transformations optimized using standard deep learning tools.

To alleviate this gap, we introduce an automated annotation pipeline that integrates kinematic-based motion computation with linguistic parsing, enabling detailed decomposition and description of complex human motions. Based on this pipeline, we construct and release the Kinematic Parsing Motion Benchmark (KPM-Bench), a novel open-source dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained motion understanding. KPM-Bench consists of (i) fine-grained video-caption pairs that comprehensively illustrate limb-level dynamics in complex actions, (ii) diverse and challenging question-answer pairs focusing specifically on motion understanding, and (iii) a meticulously curated evaluation set specifically designed to assess hallucination phenomena associated with motion descriptions. Furthermore, to address hallucination issues systematically, we propose the linguistically grounded Motion Parsing and Extraction (MoPE) algorithm, capable of accurately extracting motion-specific attributes directly from textual captions. Leveraging MoPE, we introduce a precise hallucination evaluation metric that functions independently of large-scale vision-language or language-only models. By integrating MoPE into the GRPO post-training framework, we effectively mitigate hallucination problems, significantly improving the reliability of motion-centric video captioning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5b57\u5e55\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u5b57\u5e55\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u907f\u514d\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6KPM-Bench\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdMoPE\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u8fd0\u52a8\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "KPM-Bench\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5b57\u5e55\u5bf9\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u5bf9\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u96c6\uff0cMoPE\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u5b57\u5e55\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u89c6\u9891\u5b57\u5e55\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Existing methods that tackle text-to-hand-motion generation or hand animation captioning rely on studio-captured datasets with limited actions and contexts, making them costly to scale to \"in-the-wild\" settings. Further, contemporary models and their training schemes struggle to capture animation fidelity with text-motion alignment. To address this, we (1) introduce '3D Hands in the Wild' (3D-HIW), a dataset of 32K 3D hand-motion sequences and aligned text, and (2) propose CLUTCH, an LLM-based hand animation system with two critical innovations: (a) SHIFT, a novel VQ-VAE architecture to tokenize hand motion, and (b) a geometric refinement stage to finetune the LLM. To build 3D-HIW, we propose a data annotation pipeline that combines vision-language models (VLMs) and state-of-the-art 3D hand trackers, and apply it to a large corpus of egocentric action videos covering a wide range of scenarios. To fully capture motion in-the-wild, CLUTCH employs SHIFT, a part-modality decomposed VQ-VAE, which improves generalization and reconstruction fidelity. Finally, to improve animation quality, we introduce a geometric refinement stage, where CLUTCH is co-supervised with a reconstruction loss applied directly to decoded hand motion parameters. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on text-to-motion and motion-to-text tasks, establishing the first benchmark for scalable in-the-wild hand motion modelling.

Traditionally, social minds have been regarded as an exclusive property of living beings. Although large language models (LLMs) are widely accepted as powerful approximations of human behavior, with multi-LLM system being extensively explored to enhance their capabilities, it remains controversial whether they can be meaningfully compared to human social minds. In this work, we explore neural synchrony between socially interacting LLMs as an empirical evidence for this debate. Specifically, we introduce neural synchrony during social simulations as a novel proxy for analyzing the sociality of LLMs at the representational level. Through carefully designed experiments, we demonstrate that it reliably reflects both social engagement and temporal alignment in their interactions. Our findings indicate that neural synchrony between LLMs is strongly correlated with their social performance, highlighting an important link between neural synchrony and the social behaviors of LLMs. Our work offers a new perspective to examine the \"social minds\" of LLMs, highlighting surprising parallels in the internal dynamics that underlie human and LLM social interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) forecasting from satellite observations, however, remains challenging due to sparse and irregular sampling caused by cloud coverage, as well as the heterogeneous climatic conditions under which crops evolve. In this work, we propose a probabilistic forecasting framework specifically designed for field-level NDVI prediction under clear-sky acquisition constraints. The method leverages a transformer-based architecture that explicitly separates the modeling of historical vegetation dynamics from future exogenous information, integrating historical NDVI observations with both historical and future meteorological covariates. To address irregular revisit patterns and horizon-dependent uncertainty, we introduce a temporal-distance weighted quantile loss that aligns the training objective with the effective forecasting horizon. In addition, we incorporate cumulative and extreme-weather feature engineering to better capture delayed meteorological effects relevant to vegetation response. Extensive experiments on European satellite data demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms a diverse set of statistical, deep learning, and recent time series baselines across both point-wise and probabilistic evaluation metrics. Ablation studies further highlight the central role of target history, while showing that meteorological covariates provide complementary gains when jointly exploited.

Recent theoretical advances have provided a deep understanding of how SGD enables feature learning in high-dimensional nonlinear models, most notably the \\textit{single-index model} with i.i.d. data. In this work, we study the sequential learning problem for single-index models, also known as generalized linear bandits or ridge bandits, where SGD is a simple and natural solution, yet its learning dynamics remain largely unexplored. We show that, similar to the optimal interactive learner, SGD undergoes a distinct ``burn-in'' phase before entering the ``learning'' phase in this setting. Moreover, with an appropriately chosen learning rate schedule, a single SGD procedure simultaneously achieves near-optimal (or best-known) sample complexity and regret guarantees across both phases, for a broad class of link functions.

Human curation of hard questions is highly expensive, especially in recent benchmarks using PhD-level domain knowledge to challenge the most capable models. Even then, there is always a concern about whether these questions test genuine reasoning or if similar problems have been seen during training. Here, we take inspiration from 16th-century mathematical duels to design The Token Games (TTG): an evaluation framework where models challenge each other by creating their own puzzles. We leverage the format of Programming Puzzles - given a Python function that returns a boolean, find inputs that make it return True - to flexibly represent problems and enable verifying solutions. Using results from pairwise duels, we then compute Elo ratings, allowing us to compare models relative to each other.

While significant research has focused on protecting traditional FL-IDS with centralized aggregation servers, there remains a notable gap in addressing the unique challenges of decentralized FL-IDS (DFL-IDS). This study aims to address the limitations of traditional centralized FL-IDS by proposing a novel defense framework tailored for the decentralized FL-IDS architecture, with a focus on privacy preservation and robustness against poisoning attacks. We propose PenTiDef, a privacy-preserving and robust defense framework for DFL-IDS, which incorporates Distributed Differential Privacy (DDP) to protect data confidentiality and utilizes latent space representations (LSR) derived from neural networks to detect malicious updates in the decentralized model aggregation context. To eliminate single points of failure and enhance trust without a centralized aggregation server, PenTiDef employs a blockchain-based decentralized coordination mechanism that manages model aggregation, tracks update history, and supports trust enforcement through smart contracts. Experimental results on CIC-IDS2018 and Edge-IIoTSet demonstrate that PenTiDef consistently outperforms existing defenses (e.g., FLARE, FedCC) across various attack scenarios and data distributions. These findings highlight the potential of PenTiDef as a scalable and secure framework for deploying DFL-based IDS in adversarial environments.

In many use cases, such as medical studies or political polling, different sources incur different sampling costs. Observations often have associated group identities (for example, health markers, demographics, or political affiliations) and the relative composition of these groups may differ substantially, both among the source populations and between sources and target population.\n  In this work, we study multi-source data collection under a fixed budget, focusing on the estimation of population means and group-conditional means. We show that naive data collection strategies (e.g. attempting to \"match\" the target distribution) or relying on standard estimators (e.g. sample mean) can be highly suboptimal. Instead, we develop a sampling plan which maximizes the effective sample size: the total sample size divided by $D_{\u03c7^2}(q\\mid\\mid\\overline{p}) + 1$, where $q$ is the target distribution, $\\overline{p}$ is the aggregated source distribution, and $D_{\u03c7^2}$ is the $\u03c7^2$-divergence. We pair this sampling plan with a classical post-stratification estimator and upper bound its risk. We provide matching lower bounds, establishing that our approach achieves the budgeted minimax optimal risk.

Portions of this work were published at the ICLR 2025 Workshop on Foundation Models in the Wild (see arXiv:2505.22637)", "summary": "Steering vectors are a lightweight method for controlling language model behavior by adding a learned bias to the activations at inference time. Although effective on average, steering effect sizes vary across samples and are unreliable for many target behaviors. In my thesis, I investigate why steering reliability differs across behaviors and how it is impacted by steering vector training data. First, I find that higher cosine similarity between training activation differences predicts more reliable steering. Second, I observe that behavior datasets where positive and negative activations are better separated along the steering direction are more reliably steerable. Finally, steering vectors trained on different prompt variations are directionally distinct, yet perform similarly well and exhibit correlated efficacy across datasets. My findings suggest that steering vectors are unreliable when the latent target behavior representation is not effectively approximated by the linear steering direction.

Unlike expectation-based risk, CVaR depends on an endogenous, data-dependent quantile, which couples tail averaging with threshold estimation and fundamentally alters both generalization and robustness properties. In this work, we develop a learning-theoretic analysis of CVaR-based empirical risk minimization under heavy-tailed and contaminated data. We establish sharp, high-probability generalization and excess risk bounds under minimal moment assumptions, covering fixed hypotheses, finite and infinite classes, and extending to $\u03b2$-mixing dependent data; we further show that these rates are minimax optimal. To capture the intrinsic quantile sensitivity of CVaR, we derive a uniform Bahadur-Kiefer type expansion that isolates a threshold-driven error term absent in mean-risk ERM and essential in heavy-tailed regimes. We complement these results with robustness guarantees by proposing a truncated median-of-means CVaR estimator that achieves optimal rates under adversarial contamination. Finally, we show that CVaR decisions themselves can be intrinsically unstable under heavy tails, establishing a fundamental limitation on decision robustness even when the population optimum is well separated. Together, our results provide a principled characterization of when CVaR learning generalizes and is robust, and when instability is unavoidable due to tail scarcity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86CVaR\u5728\u91cd\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u6790CVaR\u5728\u91cd\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acbCVaR\u5728\u91cd\u5c3e\u548c\u6c61\u67d3\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e00\u822c\u5316\u548c\u5269\u4f59\u98ce\u9669\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u526a\u679d\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570CVaR\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86CVaR\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4f55\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u5c3e\u90e8\u7a00\u7f3a\u65f6\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3aCVaR\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a novel approach to construct semantically-grounded soft label targets using Language Models (LMs) by projecting the next token probabilities, conditioned on a specialized prompt, onto a pre-defined vocabulary to obtain contextually enriched supervision signals.

While effective, these modules introduce significant architectural complexity and computational overhead. Recent studies suggest that plain Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders, when scaled with sufficient capacity and large-scale pre-training, can conduct accurate image segmentation without requiring specialized modules. Motivated by this observation, we propose the Video Encoder-only Mask Transformer (VidEoMT), a simple encoder-only video segmentation model that eliminates the need for dedicated tracking modules. To enable temporal modeling in an encoder-only ViT, VidEoMT introduces a lightweight query propagation mechanism that carries information across frames by reusing queries from the previous frame. To balance this with adaptability to new content, it employs a query fusion strategy that combines the propagated queries with a set of temporally-agnostic learned queries. As a result, VidEoMT attains the benefits of a tracker without added complexity, achieving competitive accuracy while being 5x--10x faster, running at up to 160 FPS with a ViT-L backbone.

We validate this framework via AnCoder, a family of models showing that structurally anchored diffusion offers a parameter-efficient path to high-quality code generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "AnchorTree\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u951a\u5b9a\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5c0a\u91cd\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ecf\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u6267\u884c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86AnchorTree\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u951a\u5b9a\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u4f7f\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u6811\u6765\u4f18\u5148\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5982\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u548c\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5efa\u7acb\u7ed3\u6784\u652f\u67b6\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u5269\u4f59\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7AnCoder\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7ed3\u6784\u951a\u5b9a\u7684\u6269\u6563\u662f\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "AnchorTree\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In this study, we address this issue by uniting offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) with cross-embodiment learning. Offline RL leverages both expert and abundant suboptimal data, and cross-embodiment learning aggregates heterogeneous robot trajectories across diverse morphologies to acquire universal control priors. We perform a systematic analysis of this offline RL and cross-embodiment paradigm, providing a principled understanding of its strengths and limitations. To evaluate this offline RL and cross-embodiment paradigm, we construct a suite of locomotion datasets spanning 16 distinct robot platforms. Our experiments confirm that this combined approach excels at pre-training with datasets rich in suboptimal trajectories, outperforming pure behavior cloning. However, as the proportion of suboptimal data and the number of robot types increase, we observe that conflicting gradients across morphologies begin to impede learning. To mitigate this, we introduce an embodiment-based grouping strategy in which robots are clustered by morphological similarity and the model is updated with a group gradient. This simple, static grouping substantially reduces inter-robot conflicts and outperforms existing conflict-resolution methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Combining offline RL and cross-embodiment learning enhances robot policy pre-training, but challenges remain in managing conflicts between different robot types.", "motivation": "Scalable robot policy pre-training has been hindered by the high cost of collecting high-quality demonstrations for each platform.", "method": "Uniting offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) with cross-embodiment learning.", "result": "Combined approach excels at pre-training with datasets rich in suboptimal trajectories, outperforming pure behavior cloning.

We study three optimizers from the DSPy framework -- COPRO, MiPROv2, and SIMBA -- across four benchmarks and three model families. We find that instruction optimization consistently improves verification accuracy, with MiPROv2 yielding the most stable gains for CoT, and SIMBA providing the largest benefits for ReAct agents, particularly at larger model scales. Behavioral analyses reveal that SIMBA encourages more direct reasoning paths by applying heuristics, thereby improving numerical comparison abilities in CoT reasoning and helping avoid unnecessary tool calls in ReAct agents. Across different prompting techniques, CoT remains effective for tabular fact checking, especially with smaller models.

Existing multi-modal pre-training methods largely overlook robustness, treating it as a downstream adaptation problem. In this work, we propose Robust Multi-Modal Masked Reconstruction (Robust-MMR), a self-supervised pre-training framework that explicitly incorporates robustness objectives into masked vision-language learning. Robust-MMR integrates asymmetric perturbation-aware masking, domain-consistency regularization, and modality-resilience constraints to encourage domain-invariant representations. We evaluate Robust-MMR on multiple medical vision-language benchmarks, including medical visual question answering (VQA-RAD, SLAKE, VQA-2019), cross-domain image-text classification (MELINDA), and robust image-caption retrieval (ROCO). Robust-MMR achieves 78.9% cross-domain accuracy on VQA-RAD, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.8 percentage points, and reaches 74.6% and 77.0% accuracy on SLAKE and VQA-2019, respectively. Under perturbed evaluation, Robust-MMR improves VQA-RAD accuracy from 69.1% to 75.6%. For image-text classification, cross-domain MELINDA accuracy increases from 70.3% to 75.2%, while retrieval experiments show a reduction in mean rank degradation from over 16 to 4.1 under perturbation.

For many downstream tasks, however, the clinically meaningful unit is not a single CUI but a concept set comprising related synonyms, subtypes, and supertypes. Constructing such concept sets is labour-intensive, inconsistently performed, and poorly supported by existing tools, particularly for NLP pipelines that operate directly on UMLS CUIs. Methods We present CUICurate, a Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) framework for automated UMLS concept set curation. A UMLS knowledge graph (KG) was constructed and embedded for semantic retrieval. For each target concept, candidate CUIs were retrieved from the KG, followed by large language model (LLM) filtering and classification steps comparing two LLMs (GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini). The framework was evaluated on five lexically heterogeneous clinical concepts against a manually curated benchmark and gold-standard concept sets. Results Across all concepts, CUICurate produced substantially larger and more complete concept sets than the manual benchmarks whilst matching human precision. Comparisons between the two LLMs found that GPT-5-mini achieved higher recall during filtering, while GPT-5 produced classifications that more closely aligned with clinician judgements. Outputs were stable across repeated runs and computationally inexpensive. Conclusions CUICurate offers a scalable and reproducible approach to support UMLS concept set curation that substantially reduces manual effort. By integrating graph-based retrieval with LLM reasoning, the framework produces focused candidate concept sets that can be adapted to clinical NLP pipelines for different phenotyping and analytic requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "CUICurate\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u548cLLM\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8aNLP\u7ba1\u9053\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u578b\u548c\u5206\u6790\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u4e34\u5e8a\u6982\u5ff5\u96c6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u64cd\u4f5cUMLS CUIs\u7684NLP\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CUICurate\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaUMLS\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u4ece\u56fe\u8c31\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u5019\u9009CUIs\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "CUICurate\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u6bd4\u4eba\u5de5\u57fa\u51c6\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u3001\u66f4\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u96c6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "CUICurate\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301UMLS\u6982\u5ff5\u96c6\u7684\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002"}}

We observe that most analyzers focus on a limited set of weaknesses, that the vulnerabilities they detect are rarely exploitable, and that evaluations use custom benchmarks that are too small to enable robust assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u4e86\u89e3\u9759\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86246\u4e2a\u9759\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u5668", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5206\u6790\u5668\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5f88\u5c11\u53ef\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u592a\u5c0f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7a33\u5065\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u9759\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u5668\u7684\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Current theoretical explanations for this capability assume test tasks are drawn from a distribution similar to that seen during pretraining. This assumption overlooks adversarial distribution shifts that threaten real-world reliability. To address this gap, we introduce a distributionally robust meta-learning framework that provides worst-case performance guarantees for ICL under Wasserstein-based distribution shifts. Focusing on linear self-attention Transformers, we derive a non-asymptotic bound linking adversarial perturbation strength ($\u03c1$), model capacity ($m$), and the number of in-context examples ($N$). The analysis reveals that model robustness scales with the square root of its capacity ($\u03c1_{\\text{max}} \\propto \\sqrt{m}$), while adversarial settings impose a sample complexity penalty proportional to the square of the perturbation magnitude ($N_\u03c1- N_0 \\propto \u03c1^2$).

These challenges stem from two primary aspects: 1) efficiently incorporating a larger number of frames within memory constraints, and 2) extracting discriminative information from the vast volume of input data. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end schema for long-form video understanding, which includes an information-density-based adaptive video sampler (AVS) and an autoencoder-based spatiotemporal video compressor (SVC) integrated with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our proposed system offers two major advantages: it adaptively and effectively captures essential information from video sequences of varying durations, and it achieves high compression rates while preserving crucial discriminative information. The proposed framework demonstrates promising performance across various benchmarks, excelling in both long-form video understanding tasks and standard video understanding benchmarks.

We show that this assumption is false. Using SOMtime, a topology-preserving representation method based on high-capacity Self-Organizing Maps, we demonstrate that sensitive attributes such as age and income emerge as dominant latent axes in purely unsupervised embeddings, even when explicitly excluded from the input. On two large-scale real-world datasets (the World Values Survey across five countries and the Census-Income dataset), SOMtime recovers monotonic orderings aligned with withheld sensitive attributes, achieving Spearman correlations of up to 0.85, whereas PCA and UMAP typically remain below 0.23 (with a single exception reaching 0.31), and against t-SNE and autoencoders which achieve at most 0.34. Furthermore, unsupervised segmentation of SOMtime embeddings produces demographically skewed clusters, demonstrating downstream fairness risks without any supervised task. These findings establish that \\textit{fairness through unawareness} fails at the representation level for ordinal sensitive attributes and that fairness auditing must extend to unsupervised components of machine learning pipelines.

Despite its practical significance, this within-document retrieval failure mode has received limited systematic attention in the Financial Question Answering (QA) literature. We evaluate retrieval at multiple levels of granularity, document, page, and chunk level, and introduce an oracle based analysis to provide empirical upper bounds on retrieval and generative performance. On a 150 question subset of FinanceBench, we reproduce and compare diverse retrieval strategies including dense, sparse, hybrid, and hierarchical methods with reranking and query reformulation. Across methods, gains in document discovery tend to translate into stronger page recall, yet oracle performance still suggests headroom for page and chunk level retrieval. To target this gap, we introduce a domain fine-tuned page scorer that treats pages as an intermediate retrieval unit between documents and chunks. Unlike prior passage-based hierarchical retrieval, we fine-tune a bi-encoder specifically for page-level relevance on financial filings, exploiting the semantic coherence of pages.

Existing unlearning methods target parameters alone, leaving two critical gaps: (i) parameter-memory backflow, where retrieval reactivates parametric remnants or memory artifacts reintroduce sensitive content, and (ii) the absence of a unified strategy that covers both parameter and memory pathways. We present Synchronized Backflow Unlearning (SBU), a framework that unlearns jointly across parameter and memory pathways. The memory pathway performs dependency closure-based unlearning that prunes isolated entities while logically invalidating shared artifacts.

These pathways are integrated via a synchronized dual-update protocol, forming a closed-loop mechanism where memory unlearning and parametric suppression reinforce each other to prevent cross-pathway recontamination.

In this paper, we conducted an experimental study with a collected dataset on detecting PowerShell-based fileless cryptojacking scripts.

These improvements are evident in a wide range of VLMs built on a variety of base models, alignment architectures, and training data. However, recent works show that these models trail behind in traditional image classification benchmarks, which test fine-grained visual knowledge. We test a large number of recent VLMs on fine-grained classification benchmarks and identify potential factors in the disconnect between fine-grained knowledge and other vision benchmarks. Through a series of ablation experiments, we find that using a better LLM improves all benchmark scores equally, while a better vision encoder disproportionately improves fine-grained classification performance. Furthermore, we find that the pretraining stage is also vital to fine-grained performance, particularly when the language model weights are unfrozen during pretraining. These insights pave the way for enhancing fine-grained visual understanding and vision-centric capabilities in VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Crucially, enhancing policy expressiveness is pivotal for achieving superior performance. Diffusion-based generative models are well-positioned to meet this demand, having demonstrated remarkable expressiveness and multimodal representation in image generation and offline settings. Yet, their potential in online MARL remains largely under-explored. A major obstacle is that the intractable likelihoods of diffusion models impede entropy-based exploration and coordination. To tackle this challenge, we propose among the first \\underline{O}nline off-policy \\underline{MA}RL framework using \\underline{D}iffusion policies (\\textbf{OMAD}) to orchestrate coordination. Our key innovation is a relaxed policy objective that maximizes scaled joint entropy, facilitating effective exploration without relying on tractable likelihood. Complementing this, within the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, we employ a joint distributional value function to optimize decentralized diffusion policies. It leverages tractable entropy-augmented targets to guide the simultaneous updates of diffusion policies, thereby ensuring stable coordination.

This paper argues that such approaches are increasingly obscure rather than illuminating system behavior. We examine how evaluation pipelines themselves introduce silent failure modes, why high benchmark scores routinely mislead teams, and how agentic systems fundamentally alter the meaning of performance measurement.

This paper presents a case study of representative PTQ baselines applied to reasoning-oriented models such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen series (1.5B/7B/14B) and QwQ-32B. We evaluate four distinct algorithms, including AWQ, GPTQ, SmoothQuant, and FlatQuant, to cover the spectrum from weight-only compression to advanced rotation-based methods. Our empirical results reveal significant platform sensitivity. While 4-bit weight-only quantization proves viable for larger models, aggressive 4-bit weight-activation schemes suffer from layer-wise calibration instability on the NPU, leading to logic collapse in long-context reasoning tasks.

This paper presents the first hardware-level backend retrieval data-stealing attack, showing that accelerator optimizations designed for performance can directly undermine data confidentiality and bypass state-of-the-art privacy defenses.\n  Our attack, FEATUREBLEED, exploits zero-skipping in AI accelerators to infer private backend-retrieved features solely through end-to-end timing, without relying on power analysis, DVFS manipulation, or shared-cache side channels. We evaluate FEATUREBLEED on three datasets spanning medical and non-medical domains: Texas-100X (clinical records), OrganAMNIST (medical imaging), and Census-19 (socioeconomic data). We further evaluate FEATUREBLEED across three hardware backends (Intel AVX, Intel AMX, and NVIDIA A100) and three model architectures (DNNs, CNNs, and hybrid CNN-MLP pipelines), demonstrating that the leakage generalizes across CPU and GPU accelerators, data modalities, and application domains, with an adversarial advantage of up to 98.87 percentage points.\n  Finally, we identify the root cause of the leakage as sparsity-driven zero-skipping in modern hardware. We quantify the privacy-performance-power trade-off: disabling zero-skipping increases Intel AMX per-operation energy by up to 25 percent and incurs 100 percent performance overhead. We propose a padding-based defense that masks timing leakage by equalizing responses to the worst-case execution time, achieving protection with only 7.24 percent average performance overhead and no additional power cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u786c\u4ef6\u7ea7\u540e\u7aef\u68c0\u7d22\u6570\u636e\u7a83\u53d6\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0AI\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u96f6\u8df3\u8fc7\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u586b\u5145\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u5982\u4ea7\u54c1\u63a8\u8350\u3001\u533b\u7597\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u4e2d\uff0c\u540e\u7aef\u5bcc\u96c6\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u5bc6\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u68c0\u7d22\u5f71\u54cd\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u79c1\u6709\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4eceAPI\u8c03\u7528\u8005\u9690\u85cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFEATUREBLEED\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u7ea7\u540e\u7aef\u68c0\u7d22\u6570\u636e\u7a83\u53d6\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u8be5\u653b\u51fb\u5229\u7528AI\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u96f6\u8df3\u8fc7\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u65ad\u79c1\u6709\u540e\u7aef\u68c0\u7d22\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u529f\u8017\u5206\u6790\u3001DVFS\u64cd\u4f5c\u6216\u5171\u4eab\u7f13\u5b58\u4fa7\u4fe1\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u975e\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86FEATUREBLEED\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u786c\u4ef6\u540e\u7aef\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6cc4\u6f0f\u5728CPU\u548cGPU\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u8fbe98.87\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u73b0\u4ee3\u786c\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u9a71\u52a8\u96f6\u8df3\u8fc7\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u586b\u5145\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u54cd\u5e94\u5747\u7b49\u5316\u5230\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u6765\u63a9\u76d6\u65f6\u95f4\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ec57.24%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u6ca1\u6709\u989d\u5916\u7684\u529f\u8017\u6210\u672c\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002"}}

However, in practice, the quality and consistency of the synthesized views are fundamentally limited by the reliability of the underlying depth estimates, which are often fragile under low texture, adverse weather, and occlusion-heavy real-world conditions. In this work, we show that incorporating sparse multimodal range measurements provides a simple yet effective way to overcome these limitations. We introduce a multimodal depth reconstruction framework that leverages extremely sparse range sensing data, such as automotive radar or LiDAR, to produce dense depth maps that serve as robust geometric conditioning for diffusion-based novel view synthesis. Our approach models depth in an angular domain using a localized Gaussian Process formulation, enabling computationally efficient inference while explicitly quantifying uncertainty in regions with limited observations. The reconstructed depth and uncertainty are used as a drop-in replacement for monocular depth estimators in existing diffusion-based rendering pipelines, without modifying the generative model itself. Experiments on real-world multimodal driving scenes demonstrate that replacing vision-only depth with our sparse range-based reconstruction substantially improves both geometric consistency and visual quality in single-image novel-view video generation. These results highlight the importance of reliable geometric priors for diffusion-based view synthesis and demonstrate the practical benefits of multimodal sensing even at extreme levels of sparsity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8ddd\u79bb\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8ddd\u79bb\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u516c\u5f0f\u5728\u89d2\u5ea6\u57df\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6e32\u67d3\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u66ff\u4ee3\u4ec5\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u9760\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0a\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u4e5f\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u76ca\u5904"}}

In this work, we present the first provable security analysis of the LINE version two (LINEv2) messaging protocol, focusing on its cryptographic guarantees in a real-world setting. We capture the architecture and security of the LINE messaging protocol by modifying the Multi-Stage Key Exchange (MSKE) model, a framework for analysing cryptographic protocols under adversarial conditions. While LINEv2 achieves basic security properties such as key indistinguishability and message authentication, we highlight the lack of forward secrecy (FS) and post-compromise security (PCS).

With the success of neural networks on such large-scale problems, more research in machine learning is being conducted now than ever before. This dissertation focuses on three different projects rooted in mathematical theory for machine learning applications.\n  The first project deals with supervised learning and manifold learning. In theory, one of the main problems in supervised learning is that of function approximation: that is, given some data set $\\mathcal{D}=\\{(x_j,f(x_j))\\}_{j=1}^M$, can one build a model $F\\approx f$? We introduce a method which aims to remedy several of the theoretical shortcomings of the current paradigm for supervised learning.\n  The second project deals with transfer learning, which is the study of how an approximation process or model learned on one domain can be leveraged to improve the approximation on another domain. We study such liftings of functions when the data is assumed to be known only on a part of the whole domain. We are interested in determining subsets of the target data space on which the lifting can be defined, and how the local smoothness of the function and its lifting are related.\n  The third project is concerned with the classification task in machine learning, particularly in the active learning paradigm. Classification has often been treated as an approximation problem as well, but we propose an alternative approach leveraging techniques originally introduced for signal separation problems. We introduce theory to unify signal separation with classification and a new algorithm which yields competitive accuracy to other recent active learning algorithms while providing results much faster.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u5f00\u5c55\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u9879\u76ee\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6210\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u3002", "method": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6d41\u5f62\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e09\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u3002", "result": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e8\u5728\u5f25\u8865\u5f53\u524d\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u7406\u8bba\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4ec5\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u77e5\u7684\u57df\u4e2d\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e09\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5c06\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u79bb\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Code and models available at https://github.com/Bluesman79/ZACH-ViT", "summary": "Vision Transformers rely on positional embeddings and class tokens that encode fixed spatial priors. While effective for natural images, these priors may hinder generalization when spatial layout is weakly informative or inconsistent, a frequent condition in medical imaging and edge-deployed clinical systems. We introduce ZACH-ViT (Zero-token Adaptive Compact Hierarchical Vision Transformer), a compact Vision Transformer that removes both positional embeddings and the [CLS] token, achieving permutation invariance through global average pooling over patch representations. The term \"Zero-token\" specifically refers to removing the dedicated [CLS] aggregation token and positional embeddings; patch tokens remain unchanged and are processed normally. Adaptive residual projections preserve training stability in compact configurations while maintaining a strict parameter budget.\n  Evaluation is performed across seven MedMNIST datasets spanning binary and multi-class tasks under a strict few-shot protocol (50 samples per class, fixed hyperparameters, five random seeds). The empirical analysis demonstrates regime-dependent behavior: ZACH-ViT (0.25M parameters, trained from scratch) achieves its strongest advantage on BloodMNIST and remains competitive with TransMIL on PathMNIST, while its relative advantage decreases on datasets with strong anatomical priors (OCTMNIST, OrganAMNIST), consistent with the architectural hypothesis. These findings support the view that aligning architectural inductive bias with data structure can be more important than pursuing universal benchmark dominance. Despite its minimal size and lack of pretraining, ZACH-ViT achieves competitive performance while maintaining sub-second inference times, supporting deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments.

There is growing interest in fine-tuning these models for such domains; however, progress is constrained by the scarcity and limited coverage of high-quality, task-relevant data. To address this, synthetic data generation methods such as paraphrasing or knowledge extraction are commonly applied. Although these approaches excel at factual recall and conceptual knowledge, they suffer from two critical shortcomings: (i) they provide minimal support for interpretive reasoning capabilities in these specialized domains, and (ii) they often produce synthetic corpora that are excessively large and redundant, resulting in poor sample efficiency.

We show that an adversary can systematically exploit clarification-seeking behavior$-$commonly encouraged in multi-turn conversation settings$-$to scalably prolong interactions. Moving beyond prompt-level behaviors, we take a mechanistic perspective and identify a query-independent, universal activation subspace associated with clarification-seeking responses. Unlike prior cost-amplification attacks that rely on per-turn prompt optimization, our attack arises from conversational dynamics and persists across prompts and tasks. We show that this mechanism provides a scalable pathway to induce turn amplification: both supply-chain attacks via fine-tuning and runtime attacks through low-level parameter corruptions consistently shift models toward abstract, clarification-seeking behavior across prompts. Across multiple instruction-tuned LLMs and benchmarks, our attack substantially increases turn count while remaining compliant.

An effective approach is representation alignment, where a strong vision foundation model is used to guide a 2D VLA model. However, existing methods usually apply supervision at only a single layer, failing to fully exploit the rich information distributed across depth; meanwhile, na\u00efve multi-layer alignment can cause gradient interference. We introduce ROCKET, a residual-oriented multi-layer representation alignment framework that formulates multi-layer alignment as aligning one residual stream to another. Concretely, ROCKET employs a shared projector to align multiple layers of the VLA backbone with multiple layers of a powerful 3D vision foundation model via a layer-invariant mapping, which reduces gradient conflicts. We provide both theoretical justification and empirical analyses showing that a shared projector is sufficient and outperforms prior designs, and further propose a Matryoshka-style sparse activation scheme for the shared projector to balance multiple alignment losses. Our experiments show that, combined with a training-free layer selection strategy, ROCKET requires only about 4% of the compute budget while achieving 98.5% state-of-the-art success rate on LIBERO. We further demonstrate the superior performance of ROCKET across LIBERO-Plus and RoboTwin, as well as multiple VLA models.

Inspired by signal processing, we introduce a frequency-aware perspective on attention by analyzing its variation during generation.

However, their performance is constrained by the quality of the reference image, which limits real-world applications where ideal reference sources are unavailable. Notably, the human visual system has the ability to accumulate visual memory, allowing image quality assessment on the basis of long-term memory storage. Inspired by this biological memory mechanism, we propose a memory-driven quality-aware framework (MQAF), which establishes a memory bank for storing distortion patterns and dynamically switches between dual-mode quality assessment strategies to reduce reliance on high-quality reference images.

We analyze compression behavior across three progressively more complex information ecosystems: controlled human-LLM continuations, generative mediation of a knowledge infrastructure (Wikipedia vs. Grokipedia), and fully synthetic social interaction environments (Moltbook vs. Reddit). Across settings, compression reveals a persistent structural signature of probabilistic generation. In controlled and mediated contexts, LLM-produced language exhibits higher structural regularity and compressibility than human-written text, consistent with a concentration of output within highly recurrent statistical patterns. However, this signature shows scale dependence: in fragmented interaction environments the separation attenuates, suggesting a fundamental limit to surface-level distinguishability at small scales. This compressibility-based separation emerges consistently across models, tasks, and domains and can be observed directly from surface text without relying on model internals or semantic evaluation.

Yet, the vast configuration space of inference servers makes exhaustive empirical evaluation infeasible due to combinatorial explosion. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on this problem by treating LLMs as configurable systems and applying variability management techniques to systematically analyze inference-time configuration choices. We evaluate our approach on the Hugging Face Transformers library by representing generation hyperparameters and their constraints using a feature-based variability model, sampling representative configurations, measuring their energy consumption, latency, accuracy, and learning predictive models from the collected data. Our results show that variability modeling effectively manages the complexity of LLM inference configurations. It enables systematic analysis of hyperparameters effects and interactions, reveals trade-offs, and supports accurate prediction of inference behavior from a limited number of measurements.

With this in mind, this paper proposes an LLM-centric Affective Visual Customization (L-AVC) task, which focuses on generating images within modifying their subjective emotions via Multimodal LLM. Further, this paper contends that how to make the model efficiently align emotion conversion in semantics (named inter-emotion semantic conversion) and how to precisely retain emotion-agnostic contents (named exter-emotion semantic retaining) are rather important and challenging in this L-AVC task. To this end, this paper proposes an Efficient and Precise Emotion Manipulating approach for editing subjective emotions in images. Specifically, an Efficient Inter-emotion Converting (EIC) module is tailored to make the LLM efficiently align emotion conversion in semantics before and after editing, followed by a Precise Exter-emotion Retaining (PER) module to precisely retain the emotion-agnostic contents. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on our constructed L-AVC dataset demonstrate the great advantage of the proposed EPEM approach to the L-AVC task over several state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivated by these gaps, this paper introduces a new chat paradigm SVU task, i.e., In-depth Security-oriented Video Understanding (DeepSVU), which aims to not only identify and locate the threats but also attribute and evaluate the causes threatening segments. Furthermore, this paper reveals two key challenges in the proposed task: 1) how to effectively model the coarse-to-fine physical-world information (e.g., human behavior, object interactions and background context) to boost the DeepSVU task; and 2) how to adaptively trade off these factors. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a new Unified Physical-world Regularized MoE (UPRM) approach.

Existing samplers typically adopt greedy heuristics, prioritizing positions with the highest local certainty to decode at each step. Through failure case analysis, we identify a fundamental limitation of this approach: it neglects the downstream impact of current decoding choices on subsequent steps and fails to minimize cumulative uncertainty. In particular, these methods do not fully exploit the non-causal nature of MDMs, which enables evaluating how a decoding decision reshapes token probabilities/uncertainty across all remaining masked positions. To bridge this gap, we propose the Info-Gain Sampler, a principled decoding framework that balances immediate uncertainty with information gain over future masked tokens. Extensive evaluations across diverse architectures and tasks (reasoning, coding, creative writing, and image generation) demonstrate that Info-Gain Sampler consistently outperforms existing samplers for MDMs. For instance, it achieves a 3.6% improvement in average accuracy on reasoning tasks and a 63.1% win-rate in creative writing. Notably, on reasoning tasks it reduces cumulative uncertainty from 78.4 to 48.6, outperforming the best baseline by a large margin.

To enhance performance, existing methods often incorporate extra observation cues (e.g., depth maps, point clouds) or auxiliary modules (e.g., object detectors, encoders) to enable more precise and reliable task execution, yet these typically require costly data collection and additional training. Inspired by the finding that Feed-Forward Network (FFN) in language models can act as \"key-value memory\", we propose Uncertainty-aware Observation Reinjection (UAOR), an effective, training-free and plug-and-play module for VLA models. Specifically, when the current language model layer exhibits high uncertainty, measured by Action Entropy, it reinjects key observation information into the next layer's Feed-Forward Network (FFN) through attention retrieval. This mechanism helps VLAs better attend to observations during inference, enabling more confident and faithful action generation. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently improves diverse VLA models across simulation and real-world tasks with minimal overhead.

This study proposes a measure of processing storage cost based on an information-theoretic formalization, as the amount of information previous words carry about future context, under uncertainty. Unlike previous discrete, grammar-based metrics, this measure is continuous, theory-neutral, and can be estimated from pre-trained neural language models.

PaCoDi fundamentally alters the problem topology: the Fourier Transform acts as a diagonalizing operator, converting locally coupled temporal signals into globally decorrelated spectral components. Theoretically, we prove the Quadrature Forward Diffusion and Conditional Reverse Factorization theorem, demonstrating that the complex diffusion process can be split into independent real and imaginary branches. We bridge the gap between this decoupled theory and data reality using a \\textbf{Mean Field Theory (MFT) approximation} reinforced by an interactive correction mechanism. Furthermore, we generalize this discrete DDPM to continuous-time Frequency SDEs, rigorously deriving the Spectral Wiener Process describe the differential spectral Brownian motion limit. Crucially, PaCoDi exploits the Hermitian Symmetry of real-valued signals to compress the sequence length by half, achieving a 50% reduction in attention FLOPs without information loss.

Existing attention manipulation methods focus exclusively on the Key space to modulate attention routing, leaving the Value space -- which governs feature aggregation -- entirely unexploited. In this paper, we first reveal that both Key and Value projections in DiT's multi-modal attention layers exhibit a pronounced bias-delta structure, where token embeddings cluster tightly around a layer-specific bias vector. Building on this observation, we propose Dual-Channel Attention Guidance (DCAG), a training-free framework that simultaneously manipulates both the Key channel (controlling where to attend) and the Value channel (controlling what to aggregate). We provide a theoretical analysis showing that the Key channel operates through the nonlinear softmax function, acting as a coarse control knob, while the Value channel operates through linear weighted summation, serving as a fine-grained complement. Together, the two-dimensional parameter space $(\u03b4_k, \u03b4_v)$ enables more precise editing-fidelity trade-offs than any single-channel method. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark (700 images, 10 editing categories) demonstrate that DCAG consistently outperforms Key-only guidance across all fidelity metrics, with the most significant improvements observed in localized editing tasks such as object deletion (4.9% LPIPS reduction) and object addition (3.2% LPIPS reduction).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDCAG\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a7\u5236\u7f16\u8f91\u5f3a\u5ea6\u662f\u6269\u6563\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u53cc\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08DCAG\uff09\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u64cd\u4f5c\u952e\u901a\u9053\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u901a\u9053\u3002", "result": "DCAG\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u952e\u901a\u9053\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "DCAG\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7f16\u8f91\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Motivated by this observation, we propose Thinking by Subtraction, a confidence-driven contrastive decoding approach that improves reasoning reliability through targeted token-level intervention. Our method, Confidence-Driven Contrastive Decoding, detects low-confidence tokens during decoding and intervenes selectively at these positions. It constructs a contrastive reference by replacing high-confidence tokens with minimal placeholders, and refines predictions by subtracting this reference distribution at low-confidence locations. Experiments show that CCD significantly improves accuracy across mathematical reasoning benchmarks while substantially reducing output length, with minimal KV-cache overhead. As a training-free method, CCD enhances reasoning reliability through targeted low-confidence intervention without computational redundancy.

Recent works typically apply semantically coarse category names as auxiliary contexts to guide the learning of discriminative visual features. However, such context provided by the action names is too limited to provide sufficient background knowledge for capturing novel spatial and temporal concepts in actions. In this paper, we propose DiST, an innovative Decomposition-incorporation framework for FSAR that makes use of decoupled Spatial and Temporal knowledge provided by large language models to learn expressive multi-granularity prototypes. In the decomposition stage, we decouple vanilla action names into diverse spatio-temporal attribute descriptions (action-related knowledge). Such commonsense knowledge complements semantic contexts from spatial and temporal perspectives. In the incorporation stage, we propose Spatial/Temporal Knowledge Compensators (SKC/TKC) to discover discriminative object-level and frame-level prototypes, respectively. In SKC, object-level prototypes adaptively aggregate important patch tokens under the guidance of spatial knowledge. Moreover, in TKC, frame-level prototypes utilize temporal attributes to assist in inter-frame temporal relation modeling. These learned prototypes thus provide transparency in capturing fine-grained spatial details and diverse temporal patterns.

Decision points are discrete legal determinations that encapsulate the legal issue, deciding authority, outcome, reasoning, and temporal context. The structured representation isolates the core determinations and their context, enabling accurate predictions and interpretable explanations. Vichara's explanations follow a structured format inspired by the IRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) framework and adapted for Indian legal reasoning. This enhances interpretability, allowing legal professionals to assess the soundness of predictions efficiently. We evaluate Vichara on two datasets, PredEx and the expert-annotated subset of the Indian Legal Documents Corpus (ILDC_expert), using four large language models: GPT-4o mini, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B. Vichara surpasses existing judgment prediction benchmarks on both datasets, with GPT-4o mini achieving the highest performance (F1: 81.5 on PredEx, 80.3 on ILDC_expert), followed by Llama-3.1-8B. Human evaluation of the generated explanations across Clarity, Linking, and Usefulness metrics highlights GPT-4o mini's superior interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Vichara\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u53f8\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0a\u8bc9\u5224\u51b3\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0cGPT-4o mini\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u7b49\u53f8\u6cd5\u7ba1\u8f96\u533a\uff0c\u6cd5\u9662\u9762\u4e34\u5927\u91cf\u6848\u4ef6\u79ef\u538b\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5224\u51b3\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u53d8\u9769\u6027\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Vichara\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u5370\u5ea6\u53f8\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cf\u8eab\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u9884\u6d4b\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0a\u8bc9\u5224\u51b3\u3002Vichara\u5904\u7406\u82f1\u6587\u4e0a\u8bc9\u6848\u4ef6\u5ba1\u7406\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\u3002\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\u662f\u5305\u542b\u6cd5\u5f8b\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u51b3\u5b9a\u6743\u3001\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u7406\u7531\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5224\u65ad\u3002\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\u5c06\u6838\u5fc3\u5224\u65ad\u53ca\u5176\u80cc\u666f\u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u6765\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002Vichara\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u91c7\u7528\u53d7IRAC\uff08\u95ee\u9898-\u89c4\u5219-\u5e94\u7528-\u7ed3\u8bba\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u5370\u5ea6\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8c03\u6574\u3002\u8fd9\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728PredEx\u548c\u5370\u5ea6\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u4ef6\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff08ILDC_expert\uff09\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6ce8\u91ca\u5b50\u96c6\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cVichara\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5224\u51b3\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0cGPT-4o mini\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff08PredEx\u4e0a\u7684F1\u503c\u4e3a81.5\uff0cILDC_expert\u4e0a\u7684F1\u503c\u4e3a80.3\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u662fLlama-3.1-8B\u3002\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3001\u94fe\u63a5\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e09\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u4eba\u8bc4\u663e\u793a\uff0cGPT-4o mini\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "Vichara\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0a\u8bc9\u5224\u51b3\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

We address this limitation with a two-phase training strategy for fine-grained road marking segmentation that removes full supervision during pretraining and halves the amount of training data during fine-tuning while still outperforming the comparable supervised baseline model. During the self-supervised pretraining, BEVFormer predictions are differentiably reprojected into the image plane and trained against multi-view semantic pseudo-labels generated by the widely used semantic segmentation model Mask2Former. A temporal loss encourages consistency across frames. The subsequent supervised fine-tuning phase requires only 50% of the dataset and significantly less training time. With our method, the fine-tuning benefits from rich priors learned during pretraining boosting the performance and BEV segmentation quality (up to +2.5pp mIoU over the fully supervised baseline) on nuScenes. It simultaneously halves the usage of annotation data and reduces total training time by up to two thirds.

However, applying advanced deep learning models in challenging, volatile domains like finance is difficult due to the inherent limitation and dynamic nature of financial time series data. This scarcity often results in sub-optimal model training and poor generalization. The fundamental challenge lies in determining how to reliably augment scarce financial time series data to enhance the predictive accuracy of deep learning forecasting models. Our main contribution is a demonstration of how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can effectively serve as a data augmentation tool to overcome data scarcity in the financial domain. Specifically, we show that training a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) forecasting model on a dataset augmented with synthetic data generated by a transformer-based GAN (TTS-GAN) significantly improves the forecasting accuracy compared to using real data alone. We confirm these results across different financial time series (Bitcoin and S\\&P500 price data) and various forecasting horizons. Furthermore, we propose a novel, time series specific quality metric that combines Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and a modified Deep Dataset Dissimilarity Measure (DeD-iMs) to reliably monitor the training progress and evaluate the quality of the generated data. These findings provide compelling evidence for the benefits of GAN-based data augmentation in enhancing financial predictive capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Using 22 language models, we construct a large-scale knowledge base of political position predictions for 23,228 arguments drawn from 30 debates that appeared on the UK politicial television programme \\textit{Question Time}. Pointwise evaluation shows moderate human-model agreement (Krippendorff's $\u03b1=0.578$), reflecting intrinsic subjectivity, while pairwise validation reveals substantially stronger alignment between human- and model-derived rankings ($\u03b1=0.86$ for the best model).

We propose Grassmannian MoE (GrMoE), a routing framework that operates on the Grassmannian manifold of subspaces, where gating weights arise from the concentration parameters of Matrix Bingham distributions. This construction yields a single, interpretable knob -- the concentration matrix $\u039b$ -- that continuously controls routing entropy, replacing discrete top-$k$ selection with a smooth, geometrically principled sparsity mechanism. We further develop an amortized variational inference procedure for posterior routing distributions, enabling uncertainty-aware expert assignment that naturally resists expert collapse. We formally prove tight bounds relating the Bingham concentration spectrum to routing entropy, expected top-$k$ mass, and an exponential bound on expert collapse, establishing the first formal theory of concentration-controlled sparsity. On synthetic routing tasks, a 350M-parameter MoE language model with 8 experts, a 1.3B-parameter model with 16 experts, and a 2.7B-parameter model with 32 experts, GrMoE achieves 0\\% routing collapse across all seeds, comparable or better perplexity with 15--30\\% improved load balance, and a smooth monotonic relationship between concentration and effective sparsity that enables post-hoc sparsity tuning without retraining.

As a result, they fail to capture the continuous, fused, and structurally complex nature of Devanagari handwriting, where characters are connected through a shared shirorekha (horizontal headline) and exhibit rich ligature formations. We introduce DohaScript, a large scale, multi writer dataset of handwritten Hindi text collected from 531 unique contributors.

The dataset is accompanied by non identifiable demographic metadata, rigorous quality curation based on objective sharpness and resolution criteria, and page level layout difficulty annotations that facilitate stratified benchmarking.

Existing training-free acceleration methods rely on feature caching and reuse under the assumption of temporal stability. However, reusing features for multiple steps may lead to latent drift and visual degradation. We observe that model outputs evolve smoothly along much of the diffusion trajectory, enabling principled predictions rather than naive reuse. Based on this insight, we propose \\textbf{PrediT}, a training-free acceleration framework that formulates feature prediction as a linear multistep problem. We employ classical linear multistep methods to forecast future model outputs from historical information, combined with a corrector that activates in high-dynamics regions to prevent error accumulation.

However, their performance deteriorates in tasks requiring rich socio-cultural knowledge and diverse local contexts, particularly those involving Indian Culture. Existing Cultural benchmarks are (i) Manually crafted, (ii) contain single-hop questions testing factual recall, and (iii) prohibitively costly to scale, leaving this deficiency largely unmeasured. To address this, we introduce VIRAASAT, a novel, semi-automated multi-hop approach for generating cultural specific multi-hop Question-Answering dataset for Indian culture. VIRAASAT leverages a Knowledge Graph comprising more than 700 expert-curated cultural artifacts, covering 13 key attributes of Indian culture (history, festivals, etc). VIRAASAT spans all 28 states and 8 Union Territories, yielding more than 3,200 multi-hop questions that necessitate chained cultural reasoning. We evaluate current State-of-the-Art (SOTA) LLMs on VIRAASAT and identify key limitations in reasoning wherein fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought(CoT) traces fails to ground and synthesize low-probability facts. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework named Symbolic Chain-of-Manipulation (SCoM). Adapting the Chain-of-Manipulation paradigm, we train the model to simulate atomic Knowledge Graph manipulations internally. SCoM teaches the model to reliably traverse the topological structure of the graph. Experiments on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) demonstrate that SCoM outperforms standard CoT baselines by up to 20%.

Traditional approaches often fail to produce generalized and interpretable explanations, as multiple distinct input trajectories may yield nearly indistinguishable outputs. In this work, we present ruleXplain, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract formal explanations for input-output relations in simulation-driven dynamical systems. Our method introduces a constrained symbolic rule language with temporal operators and delay semantics, enabling LLMs to generate verifiable causal rules through structured prompting. ruleXplain relies on the availability of a principled model (e.g., a simulator) that maps multivariate input time series to output time series. Within ruleXplain, the simulator is used to generate diverse counterfactual input trajectories that yield similar target output, serving as candidate explanations. Such counterfactual inputs are clustered and provided as context to the LLM, which is tasked with the generation of symbolic rules encoding the joint temporal trends responsible for the patterns observable in the output times series. A closed-loop refinement process ensures rule consistency and semantic validity. We validate the framework using the PySIRTEM epidemic simulator, mapping testing rate inputs to daily infection counts; and the EnergyPlus building energy simulator, observing temperature and solar irradiance inputs to electricity needs. For validation, we perform three classes of experiments: (1) the efficacy of the ruleset through input reconstruction; (2) ablation studies evaluating the causal encoding of the ruleset; and (3) generalization tests of the extracted rules across unseen output trends with varying phase dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "ruleXplain\uff1a\u5229\u7528LLMs\u4ece\u6a21\u62df\u9a71\u52a8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u89c4\u5219", "motivation": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u5e95\u5c42\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u51fd\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u6355\u6349\u7684\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faruleXplain\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u62df\u9a71\u52a8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5219\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd0\u7b97\u7b26\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4f7fLLMs\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528PySIRTEM\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548cEnergyPlus\u5efa\u7b51\u80fd\u6e90\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u8de8\u672a\u89c1\u8f93\u51fa\u8d8b\u52bf\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u6cdb\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c4\u5219\u96c6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ruleXplain\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4ece\u6a21\u62df\u9a71\u52a8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Furthermore, failure to appropriately handle out-of-distribution (OOD) objects may introduce safety risks in real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving or medical assistance).

Therefore, we propose OODBench, a predominantly automated method with minimal human verification, for constructing new benchmarks and evaluating the ability of VLMs to process OOD data. OODBench contains 40K instance-level OOD instance-category pairs, and we show that current VLMs still exhibit notable performance degradation on OODBench, even when the underlying image categories are common. In addition, we propose a reliable automated assessment metric that employs a Basic-to-Advanced Progression of prompted questions to assess the impact of OOD data on questions of varying difficulty more fully.

However, the investigation of machine learning predictions applied to prospectively collected, standardized data from observational clinical intervention trials remains underexplored, despite its potential to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), a persistent inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses lasting more than three months, imposes a substantial burden on quality of life (QoL) and societal cost. Although many patients respond to medical therapy, others with refractory symptoms often pursue surgical intervention. Surgical decision-making in CRS is complex, as it must weigh known procedural risks against uncertain individualized outcomes. In this study, we evaluated supervised machine learning models for predicting surgical benefit in CRS, using the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) as the primary patient-reported outcome.

Understanding the mechanisms governing when memorization versus generalization occurs remains an active area of research. In particular, it is unclear where along the noise schedule memorization is induced, how data geometry influences it, and how phenomena at different noise scales interact. We introduce a geometric framework that partitions the noise schedule into three regimes based on the coverage properties of training data by Gaussian shells and the concentration behavior of the posterior, which we argue are two fundamental objects governing memorization and generalization in diffusion models. This perspective reveals that memorization risk is highly non-uniform across noise levels. We further identify a danger zone at medium noise levels where memorization is most pronounced. In contrast, both the small and large noise regimes resist memorization, but through fundamentally different mechanisms: small noise avoids memorization due to limited training coverage, while large noise exhibits low posterior concentration and admits a provably near linear Gaussian denoising behavior. For the medium noise regime, we identify geometric conditions through which we propose a geometry-informed targeted intervention that mitigates memorization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Rather than relying on complex physical modeling, we propose a self-supervised and data-driven approach, whereby DMC learns to obtain physically plausible motions when an intentionally distorted motion and the original textual descriptions are given as inputs. We evaluate DMC as a post-hoc module to improve motions obtained from various text-to-motion generation models and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving physical plausibility while enhancing semantic consistency. The experimental results show that DMC reduces FID score by 42.74% on T2M and 13.20% on T2M-GPT, while also achieving the highest R-Precision. When applied to high-quality models like MoMask, DMC improves the physical plausibility of motions by reducing penetration by 33.0% as well as adjusting floating artifacts closer to the ground-truth reference.

These attacks are computationally efficient, application-agnostic, and effective across classification, multimodal retrieval, and captioning tasks. Second, to defend against this vulnerability, inspired by recent work on robust CLIP encoders, we fine-tune popular tokenizers with unsupervised adversarial training, keeping all other components frozen. While unsupervised and task-agnostic, our approach significantly improves robustness to both unsupervised and end-to-end supervised attacks and generalizes well to unseen tasks and data.

However, existing approaches still face challenges in fine-grained semantic understanding, particularly when dealing with complex textual descriptions. To overcome these limitations, we propose DEIG, a novel framework for fine-grained and controllable multi-instance generation. DEIG integrates an Instance Detail Extractor (IDE) that transforms text encoder embeddings into compact, instance-aware representations, and a Detail Fusion Module (DFM) that applies instance-based masked attention to prevent attribute leakage across instances. These components enable DEIG to generate visually coherent multi-instance scenes that precisely match rich, localized textual descriptions.

We present LOcalized Text and Sketch with multi-level guidance (LOTS), a framework that enhances fashion image generation by combining global sketch guidance with multiple localized sketch-text pairs. LOTS employs a Multi-level Conditioning Stage to independently encode local features within a shared latent space while maintaining global structural coordination.

To validate our method, we develop Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs are provided per image.

To assess robustness beyond this setting, we also include an \"in the wild\" split with non-expert sketches, featuring higher variability and imperfections.

Recent methods achieve dense reconstructions from da Vinci robotic surgery videos, with Gaussian Splatting (GS) offering real-time performance via graphics acceleration. However, reconstruction quality in occluded regions remains limited, and depth accuracy has not been fully assessed, as benchmarks like EndoNeRF and StereoMIS lack 3D ground truth. We propose Diff2DGS, a novel two-stage framework for reliable 3D reconstruction of occluded surgical scenes. In the first stage, a diffusion-based video module with temporal priors inpaints tissue occluded by instruments with high spatial-temporal consistency. In the second stage, we adapt 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with a Learnable Deformation Model (LDM) to capture dynamic tissue deformation and anatomical geometry. We also extend evaluation beyond prior image-quality metrics by performing quantitative depth accuracy analysis on the SCARED dataset. Diff2DGS outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both appearance and geometry, reaching 38.02 dB PSNR on EndoNeRF and 34.40 dB on StereoMIS. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that optimizing for image quality alone does not necessarily translate into optimal 3D reconstruction accuracy. To address this, we further optimize the depth quality of the reconstructed 3D results, ensuring more faithful geometry in addition to high-fidelity appearance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Furthermore, existing prompt optimization techniques are poorly suited to this domain, which is highly prone to local minima. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ADAPT, a hybrid method combining beam search initialization with adaptive gradient-guided mutation, designed around these failure modes.

These issues are exacerbated in multi-view capture, where differences in lighting, sensor responses, and image signal processor (ISP) configurations introduce photometric and chromatic inconsistencies that violate the assumptions of photometric consistency underlying modern 3D novel view synthesis (NVS) methods, including Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), leading to degraded reconstruction and rendering quality. We propose Luminance-GS++, a 3DGS-based framework for robust NVS under diverse illumination conditions.

We refer to this capability as self-aware object detection.\n  We introduce a degradation-aware self-awareness framework based on degradation manifolds, which explicitly structure a detector's feature space according to image degradation rather than semantic content. Our method augments a standard detection backbone with a lightweight embedding head trained via multi-layer contrastive learning. Images sharing the same degradation composition are pulled together, while differing degradation configurations are pushed apart, yielding a geometrically organized representation that captures degradation type and severity without requiring degradation labels or explicit density modeling.\n  To anchor the learned geometry, we estimate a pristine prototype from clean training embeddings, defining a nominal operating point in representation space. Self-awareness emerges as geometric deviation from this reference, providing an intrinsic, image-level signal of degradation-induced shift that is independent of detection confidence.\n  Extensive experiments on synthetic corruption benchmarks, cross-dataset zero-shot transfer, and natural weather-induced distribution shifts demonstrate strong pristine-degraded separability, consistent behavior across multiple detector architectures, and robust generalization under semantic shift.

A common problem is reward hacking, where the policy may exploit inaccuracies of the reward and learn an unintended behavior. Most previous works address this by limiting the policy update with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) penalty towards a reference model. We propose a different framing: Train the LM in a way that biases policy updates towards regions in which the reward is more accurate. First, we derive a theoretical connection between the accuracy of a reward model and the flatness of an optimum at convergence. Gradient regularization (GR) can then be used to bias training to flatter regions and thereby maintain reward model accuracy. We confirm these results by showing that the gradient norm and reward accuracy are empirically correlated in RLHF. We then show that Reference Resets of the KL penalty implicitly use GR to find flatter regions with higher reward accuracy. We further improve on this by proposing to use explicit GR with an efficient finite-difference estimate. Empirically, GR performs better than a KL penalty across a diverse set of RL experiments with LMs. GR achieves a higher GPT-judged win-rate in RLHF, avoids overly focusing on the format in rule-based math rewards, and prevents hacking the judge in LLM-as-a-Judge math tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528GR\u63d0\u9ad8RLHF\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8eKL\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u975e\u9884\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff08GR\uff09\u6765\u4f7f\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u504f\u5411\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "GR\u5728RLHF\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eKL\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u5728\u89c4\u5219\u6027\u6570\u5b66\u5956\u52b1\u548cLLM-as-a-Judge\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5bf9\u683c\u5f0f\u6216\u8bc4\u59d4\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86GPT-judged win-rate\u3002", "conclusion": "\u68af\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff08GR\uff09\u5728RLHF\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u7b56\u7565\u5229\u7528\u5956\u52b1\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u975e\u9884\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Although this has led to significant progress in domains such as robotics, healthcare, and finance, the use of RL in practice is challenging, particularly when learning decision policies in high-stakes applications that may require guarantees. Traditional RL algorithms rely on a large number of online interactions with the environment, which is problematic in scenarios where online interactions are costly, dangerous, or infeasible. However, learning from offline datasets is hindered by the presence of hidden confounders. Such confounders can cause spurious correlations in the dataset and can mislead the agent into taking suboptimal or adversarial actions. Firstly, we address the problem of learning from offline datasets in the presence of hidden confounders. We work with instrumental variables (IVs) to identify the causal effect, which is an instance of a conditional moment restrictions (CMR) problem. Inspired by double/debiased machine learning, we derive a sample-efficient algorithm for solving CMR problems with convergence and optimality guarantees, which outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. Secondly, we relax the conditions on the hidden confounders in the setting of (offline) imitation learning, and adapt our CMR estimator to derive an algorithm that can learn effective imitator policies with convergence rate guarantees. Finally, we consider the problem of learning high-level objectives expressed in linear temporal logic (LTL) and develop a provably optimal learning algorithm that improves sample efficiency over existing methods. Through evaluation on reinforcement learning benchmarks and synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, we demonstrate the usefulness of the methods developed in this thesis in real-world decision making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u9645\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u9769\u547d\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9ad8\u6536\u76ca\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u53d8\u91cf\uff08IVs\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc/\u504f\u5dee\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u6761\u4ef6\u77e9\u9650\u5236\uff08CMR\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5408\u6210/\u534a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u9645\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u5e7f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In this paper, we use information-theoretic analysis to show that non-zero mutual information between CoT and output is a necessary but not sufficient condition for CoT monitorability. We identify two sources of approximation error that may undermine the performance of CoT monitors in practice: information gap, which measures the extent to which the monitor can extract the information available in CoT, and elicitation error, which measures the extent to which the monitor approximates the optimal monitoring function. We further demonstrate that CoT monitorability can be systematically improved through targeted training objectives. To this end, we propose two complementary approaches: (a) an oracle-based method that directly rewards the monitored model for producing CoTs that maximize monitor accuracy, and (b) a more practical, label-free approach that maximizes conditional mutual information between outputs and CoTs.

A common but poorly understood phenomenon during training is the PCC plateau: PCC stops improving early in training, even as MSE continues to decrease. We provide the first rigorous theoretical analysis of this behavior, revealing fundamental limitations in both optimization dynamics and model capacity. First, in regard to the flattened PCC curve, we uncover a critical conflict where lowering MSE (magnitude matching) can paradoxically suppress the PCC gradient (shape matching). This issue is exacerbated by the softmax attention mechanism, particularly when the data to be aggregated is highly homogeneous. Second, we identify a limitation in the model capacity: we derived a PCC improvement limit for any convex aggregator (including the softmax attention), showing that the convex hull of the inputs strictly bounds the achievable PCC gain. We demonstrate that data homogeneity intensifies both limitations. Motivated by these insights, we propose the Extrapolative Correlation Attention (ECA), which incorporates novel, theoretically-motivated mechanisms to improve the PCC optimization and extrapolate beyond the convex hull.

Recent work, Exploring the Latent Capacity of LLMs for One-Step Text Reconstruction (Mezentsev and Oseledets), shows that frozen LLMs can reconstruct hundreds of tokens from only two learned proto-tokens in a single forward pass, suggesting a path beyond the autoregressive paradigm. In this paper, we study what information these proto-tokens encode and how they behave under reconstruction and controlled constraints. We perform a series of experiments aimed at disentangling semantic and syntactic content in the two proto-tokens, analyzing stability properties of the e-token, and visualizing attention patterns to the e-token during reconstruction. Finally, we test two regularization schemes for \"imposing\" semantic structure on the e-token using teacher embeddings, including an anchor-based loss and a relational distillation objective. Our results indicate that the m-token tends to capture semantic information more strongly than the e-token under standard optimization; anchor-based constraints trade off sharply with reconstruction accuracy; and relational distillation can transfer batch-level semantic relations into the proto-token space without sacrificing reconstruction quality, supporting the feasibility of future non-autoregressive seq2seq systems that predict proto-tokens as an intermediate representation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u4e2d\u539f\u578b\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52seq2seq\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u539f\u578b\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u53d7\u63a7\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5206\u79bb\u4e24\u4e2a\u539f\u578b\u6807\u8bb0\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5206\u6790e-token\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u91cd\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9e-token\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u951a\u70b9\u7684\u635f\u5931\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u84b8\u998f\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728e-token\u4e0a\u201c\u65bd\u52a0\u201d\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cm-token\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u4f18\u5316\u4e0b\u6bd4e-token\u66f4\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u951a\u70b9\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5c16\u9510\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u5173\u7cfb\u84b8\u998f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5c06\u6279\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u539f\u578b\u6807\u8bb0\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u672a\u6765\u975e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52seq2seq\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u539f\u578b\u6807\u8bb0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u975e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52seq2seq\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u539f\u578b\u6807\u8bb0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

This semi-adversarial setting naturally sits between the classical stochastic case with i.i.d.\\ instances for which function classes with finite VC dimension are learnable; and the adversarial case with arbitrary instances, known to be significantly more restrictive. For this problem, Goel et al. (2023) showed that, if the learner knows the distribution $\u03bc$ of clean samples in advance, learning can be achieved for all VC classes without restrictions on adversary corruptions. This is, however, a strong assumption in both theory and practice: a natural question is whether similar learning guarantees can be achieved without prior distributional knowledge, as is standard in classical learning frameworks (e.g., PAC learning or asymptotic consistency) and other non-i.i.d.\\ models (e.g., smoothed online learning). We therefore focus on the distribution-free setting where $\u03bc$ is \\emph{unknown} and propose an algorithm \\textsc{AbstainBoost} based on a boosting procedure of weak learners, which guarantees sublinear error for general VC classes in \\emph{distribution-free} abstention learning for oblivious adversaries. These algorithms also enjoy similar guarantees for adaptive adversaries, for structured function classes including linear classifiers. These results are complemented with corresponding lower bounds, which reveal an interesting polynomial trade-off between misclassification error and number of erroneous abstentions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5AbstainBoost\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5f03\u6743\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b50\u7ebf\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u5f03\u6743\u6b21\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u534a\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f31\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5AbstainBoost\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u65e0\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5f03\u6743\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b50\u7ebf\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65e0\u77e5\u7684\u5bf9\u624b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u5b50\u7ebf\u6027\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u624b\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff09\u4e5f\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u65e0\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5f03\u6743\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u5f03\u6743\u6b21\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on key-value caching to accumulate frame-level information over time, but use a limited number of tokens per frame, leading to the loss of fine-grained visual details. In this work, we propose scaling the token budget to enable more granular spatiotemporal understanding and reasoning. First, we find that current methods are ill-equipped to handle dense streams: their feature encoding causes query-frame similarity scores to increase over time, biasing retrieval toward later frames.

While recent work suggests that high-dimensional concentration allows these models to implicitly estimate noise levels from corrupted observations, a fundamental paradox remains: what is the underlying landscape being optimized when the noise level is treated as a random variable, and how can a bounded, noise-agnostic network remain stable near the data manifold where gradients typically diverge? We resolve this paradox by formalizing Marginal Energy, $E_{\\text{marg}}(\\mathbf{u}) = -\\log p(\\mathbf{u})$, where $p(\\mathbf{u}) = \\int p(\\mathbf{u}|t)p(t)dt$ is the marginal density of the noisy data integrated over a prior distribution of unknown noise levels. We prove that generation using autonomous models is not merely blind denoising, but a specific form of Riemannian gradient flow on this Marginal Energy. Through a novel relative energy decomposition, we demonstrate that while the raw Marginal Energy landscape possesses a $1/t^p$ singularity normal to the data manifold, the learned time-invariant field implicitly incorporates a local conformal metric that perfectly counteracts the geometric singularity, converting an infinitely deep potential well into a stable attractor. We also establish the structural stability conditions for sampling with autonomous models. We identify a ``Jensen Gap'' in noise-prediction parameterizations that acts as a high-gain amplifier for estimation errors, explaining the catastrophic failure observed in deterministic blind models.

In this work, we utilize Symmetry-Breaking Dimensional Expansion (SBDE) as a controlled probe to investigate the mechanism underlying this trade-off.

We used a shared set of clinical and DXA-derived features across three large cohorts - the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS), and the UK Biobank (UKB), to systematically evaluate the performance of three domain adaptation methods - Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Correlation Alignment (CORAL), and Domain - Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) and their combinations. For a source cohort with males only and a source cohort with females only, domain-adaptation methods consistently showed improved performance than the no-adaptation baseline (source-only training), and the use of combinations of multiple domain adaptation methods delivered the largest and most stable gains. The method that combines MMD, CORAL, and DANN achieved the highest discrimination with the area under curve (AUC) of 0.88 for a source cohort with males only and 0.95 for a source cohort with females only), demonstrating that integrating multiple domain adaptation methods could produce feature representations that are less sensitive to dataset differences.

Legara"], "title": "Student Flow Modeling for School Decongestion via Stochastic Gravity Estimation and Constrained Spatial Allocation", "comment": null, "summary": "School congestion, where student enrollment exceeds school capacity, is a major challenge in low- and middle-income countries. It highly impacts learning outcomes and deepens inequities in education. While subsidy programs that transfer students from public to private schools offer a mechanism to alleviate congestion without capital-intensive construction, they often underperform due to fragmented data systems that hinder effective implementation. The Philippine Educational Service Contracting program, one of the world's largest educational subsidy programs, exemplifies these challenges, falling short of its goal to decongest public schools. This prevents the science-based and data-driven analyses needed to understand what shapes student enrollment flows, particularly how families respond to economic incentives and spatial constraints. We introduce a computational framework for modeling student flow patterns and simulating policy scenarios. By synthesizing heterogeneous government data across nearly 3,000 institutions, we employ a stochastic gravity model estimated via negative binomial regression to derive behavioral elasticities for distance, net tuition cost, and socioeconomic determinants. These elasticities inform a doubly constrained spatial allocation mechanism that simulates student redistribution under varying subsidy amounts while respecting both origin candidate pools and destination slot capacities. We find that geographic proximity constrains school choice four times more strongly than tuition cost and that slot capacity, not subsidy amounts, is the binding constraint. Our work demonstrates that subsidy programs alone cannot resolve systemic overcrowding, and computational modeling can empower education policymakers to make equitable, data-driven decisions by revealing the structural constraints that shape effective resource allocation, even when resources are limited.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5206\u6790\u5b66\u6821\u62e5\u6324\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5730\u7406\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u548c\u5b66\u4f4d\u5bb9\u91cf\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u5236\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u6790\u5b66\u6821\u62e5\u6324\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6559\u80b2\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u83f2\u5f8b\u5bbe\u6559\u80b2\u670d\u52a1\u5408\u540c\u8ba1\u5212\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u5b66\u6821\u62e5\u6324\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u5b66\u751f\u6d41\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u653f\u7b56\u60c5\u666f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u91cd\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8d1f\u4e8c\u9879\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u884c\u4e3a\u5f39\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5730\u7406\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u5bf9\u5b66\u6821\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6bd4\u5b66\u8d39\u9ad8\u56db\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b66\u4f4d\u5bb9\u91cf\u662f\u9650\u5236\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8865\u8d34\u91d1\u989d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8865\u8d34\u8ba1\u5212\u4e0d\u80fd\u5355\u72ec\u89e3\u51b3\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u62e5\u6324\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u6559\u80b2\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u505a\u51fa\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

While they have shown strong performance in offline RL, particularly where the target distribution is well defined, their extension to online fine-tuning has largely been treated as a direct continuation of offline pre-training, leaving key challenges unaddressed. In this paper, we propose Flow Matching with Injected Noise for Offline-to-Online RL (FINO), a novel method that leverages flow matching-based policies to enhance sample efficiency for offline-to-online RL. FINO facilitates effective exploration by injecting noise into policy training, thereby encouraging a broader range of actions beyond those observed in the offline dataset. In addition to exploration-enhanced flow policy training, we combine an entropy-guided sampling mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation, allowing the policy to adapt its behavior throughout online fine-tuning.

Yet propensities - the tendencies of models to exhibit particular behaviours - play a central role in determining both performance and safety outcomes. However, traditional IRT describes a model's success on a task as a monotonic function of model capabilities and task demands, an approach unsuited to propensities, where both excess and deficiency can be problematic. Here, we introduce the first formal framework for measuring AI propensities by using a bilogistic formulation for model success, which attributes high success probability when the model's propensity is within an \"ideal band\". Further, we estimate the limits of the ideal band using LLMs equipped with newly developed task-agnostic rubrics. Applying our framework to six families of LLM models whose propensities are incited in either direction, we find that we can measure how much the propensity is shifted and what effect this has on the tasks. Critically, propensities estimated using one benchmark successfully predict behaviour on held-out tasks. Moreover, we obtain stronger predictive power when combining propensities and capabilities than either separately. More broadly, our framework showcases how rigorous propensity measurements can be conducted and how it yields gains over solely using capability evaluations to predict AI behaviour.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6d4b\u91cfAI\u503e\u5411\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5c06\u503e\u5411\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u503e\u5411\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7ed3\u679c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684IRT\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u503e\u5411\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6d4b\u91cfAI\u503e\u5411\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u903b\u8f91\u516c\u5f0f\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u201c\u7406\u60f3\u5e26\u201d\u7684\u6781\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u503e\u5411\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u6bd4\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4ef7\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u8fdb\u884c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u503e\u5411\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6765\u9884\u6d4bAI\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u7684\u3002"}}

However, many existing approaches rely on black-box classifiers and do not explicitly model the underlying dynamics that generate observed signals. To address these limitations, we propose LERD, an end-to-end Bayesian electrophysiological neural dynamical system that infers latent neural events and their relational structure directly from multichannel EEG without event or interaction annotations.

Although exhibiting strong instantaneous learning and generalization capabilities, Dual-to-Dual MLLMs still remain deficient in lifelong evolution, significantly affecting continual adaptation to dynamic real-world scenarios. One of the challenges is that learning new tasks inevitably destroys the learned knowledge. Beyond traditional catastrophic forgetting, Dual-to-Dual MLLMs face other challenges, including hallucination, instruction unfollowing, and failures in cross-modal knowledge transfer. However, no standardized continual learning framework for Dual-to-Dual MLLMs has been established yet, leaving these challenges unexplored. Thus, in this paper, we establish Continual-NExT, a continual learning framework for Dual-to-Dual MLLMs with deliberately-architected evaluation metrics.

This single template recovers greedy decoding, Softmax sampling, Top-K, Top-P, and Sparsemax-style sparsity as special cases, and explains their common structure through optimality conditions. More importantly, the framework makes it easy to invent new decoders without folklore.

BoK targets the probability of covering good alternatives within a fixed K-sample budget and improves empirical performance.

However, strict equivariance can increase computational cost due to added architectural constraints, and can slow down convergence because the model must be consistent across a large space of possible node permutations. We study this trade-off for graph generative models. Specifically, we start from an equivariant discrete flow-matching model, and relax its equivariance during training via a controllable symmetry modulation scheme based on sinusoidal positional encodings and node permutations. Experiments first show that symmetry-breaking can accelerate early training by providing an easier learning signal, but at the expense of encouraging shortcut solutions that can cause overfitting, where the model repeatedly generates graphs that are duplicates of the training set. On the contrary, properly modulating the symmetry signal can delay overfitting while accelerating convergence, allowing the model to reach stronger performance with $19\\%$ of the baseline training epochs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While these innovations yield significant performance gains, they compromise the identity mapping property of residual connections, leading to training instability, limited scalability, and increased memory overhead. To address these challenges, we propose JPmHC (Jacobian-spectrum Preserving manifold-constrained Hyper-Connections), a framework that replaces identity skips with a trainable linear mixer acting on n parallel streams while explicitly controlling gradient conditioning. By constraining the mixer M on operator-norm-bounded manifolds (e.g., bistochastic, Stiefel, Grassmann), JPmHC prevents gradient pathologies and enhances stability. JPmHC introduces three key contributions: (i) a free-probability analysis that predicts Jacobian spectra for structured skips, providing actionable design rules for mixer selection; (ii) memory-efficient implicit differentiation for fixed-point projections, reducing activation memory and synchronization overhead; and (iii) a Stiefel-constrained mixer via Cayley transforms, ensuring orthogonality without post-hoc normalization. Empirical evaluations on ARC-AGI demonstrate that JPmHC achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, and lower computational cost compared to bistochastic baselines. As a flexible and scalable extension of HC, JPmHC advances spectrum-aware, stable, and efficient deep learning, offering insights into topological architecture design and foundational model evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A latency-aware sparse attention stack with blockwise top-k selection and locality-sensitive chunking enables global reasoning over unordered task sets with near-linear scaling and sub-millisecond inference. A multicore mapping layer converts contextualized Q-scores into processor assignments through masked-greedy selection or differentiable matching. Extensive evaluations on industrial mixed-criticality traces and large multiprocessor settings show consistent gains in deadline fulfillment over analytic schedulers and neural baselines, together with improved optimization stability. Diagnostics include sensitivity analyses for slack quantization, attention-driven policy interpretation, hardware-in-the-loop and kernel micro-benchmarks, and robustness under stress with simple runtime mitigations; we also report sample-efficiency benefits from behavioral-cloning pretraining and compatibility with an actor-critic variant without altering the inference pipeline.

In this problem, a decision-maker must allocate multiple types of resources to sequentially arriving queries over a finite horizon. Each query belongs to a finite set of types with fixed resource consumption and a stochastic reward drawn from an unknown, type-specific distribution. Critically, the environment exhibits arbitrary non-stationarity -- arrival distributions may shift unpredictably-while the algorithm requires only one historical sample per period to operate effectively. We distinguish two settings based on sample informativeness: (i) reward-observed samples containing both query type and reward realization, and (ii) the more challenging type-only samples revealing only query type information.\n  We propose a novel type-dependent quantile-based meta-policy that decouples the problem into modular components: reward distribution estimation, optimization of target service probabilities via fluid relaxation, and real-time decisions through dynamic acceptance thresholds. For reward-observed samples, our static threshold policy achieves $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret. For type-only samples, we first establish that sublinear regret is impossible without additional structure; under a mild minimum-arrival-probability assumption, we design both a partially adaptive policy attaining the same $\\tilde{O}({T})$ bound and, more significantly, a fully adaptive resolving policy with careful rounding that achieves the first poly-logarithmic regret guarantee of $O((\\log T)^3)$ for non-stationary multi-resource allocation.

This paper introduces Federated Zero Mean Gradients (FedZMG), a novel, parameter-free, client-side optimization algorithm designed to tackle client-drift by structurally regularizing the optimization space. Advancing the idea of Gradient Centralization, FedZMG projects local gradients onto a zero-mean hyperplane, effectively neutralizing the \"intensity\" or \"bias\" shifts inherent in heterogeneous data distributions without requiring additional communication or hyperparameter tuning. A theoretical analysis is provided, proving that FedZMG reduces the effective gradient variance and guarantees tighter convergence bounds compared to standard FedAvg.

This operator has a well-behaved spectral decomposition and acts as a drop-in replacement for standard Laplacians in spectral GNNs.

Prior studies have examined these explanations in different contexts, such as non-probabilistic versus probabilistic frameworks and local versus global settings. In this study, we introduce a unified framework for analyzing these explanations, demonstrating that they can all be characterized through the minimization of a unified probabilistic value function. We then prove that the complexity of these computations is influenced by three key properties of the value function: (1) *monotonicity*, (2) *submodularity*, and (3) *supermodularity* - which are three fundamental properties in *combinatorial optimization*. Our findings uncover some counterintuitive results regarding the nature of these properties within the explanation settings examined. For instance, although the *local* value functions do not exhibit monotonicity or submodularity/supermodularity whatsoever, we demonstrate that the *global* value functions do possess these properties. This distinction enables us to prove a series of novel polynomial-time results for computing various explanations with provable guarantees in the global explainability setting, across a range of ML models that span the interpretability spectrum, such as neural networks, decision trees, and tree ensembles.

However, we find a persistent failure mode of them -- sparsifying a pretrained attention model to a dilated pattern leads to severe accuracy degradation. We introduce RAT+, a dense-pretraining architecture that augments attention with full-sequence recurrence and active recurrence learning. A single RAT+ model is pretrained densely once, then flexibly switched at inference time to dilated attention (optionally with local windows) or hybrid layer/head compositions, requiring only a short 1B-token resolution adaptation rather than retraining separate sparse models.

Code available at GitHub (link in paper)", "summary": "We propose a proof of concept for a variational distributional neuron: a compute unit formulated as a VAE brick, explicitly carrying a prior, an amortized posterior and a local ELBO. The unit is no longer a deterministic scalar but a distribution: computing is no longer about propagating values, but about contracting a continuous space of possibilities under constraints. Each neuron parameterizes a posterior, propagates a reparameterized sample and is regularized by the KL term of a local ELBO - hence, the activation is distributional. This \"contraction\" becomes testable through local constraints and can be monitored via internal measures. The amount of contextual information carried by the unit, as well as the temporal persistence of this information, are locally tuned by distinct constraints. This proposal addresses a structural tension: in sequential generation, causality is predominantly organized in the symbolic space and, even when latents exist, they often remain auxiliary, while the effective dynamics are carried by a largely deterministic decoder. In parallel, probabilistic latent models capture factors of variation and uncertainty, but that uncertainty typically remains borne by global or parametric mechanisms, while units continue to propagate scalars - hence the pivot question: if uncertainty is intrinsic to computation, why does the compute unit not carry it explicitly? We therefore draw two axes: (i) the composition of probabilistic constraints, which must be made stable, interpretable and controllable; and (ii) granularity: if inference is a negotiation of distributions under constraints, should the primitive unit remain deterministic or become distributional? We analyze \"collapse\" modes and the conditions for a \"living neuron\", then extend the contribution over time via autoregressive priors over the latent, per unit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u5143\u2014\u2014\u53ef\u53d8\u5206\u5e03\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u65b9\u5f0f\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u5143\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u793a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u5143\u2014\u2014\u53ef\u53d8\u5206\u5e03\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\u7816\u5757\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u8be5\u5355\u5143\u5177\u6709\u5148\u9a8c\u3001\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u540e\u9a8c\u548c\u5c40\u90e8ELBO\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7KL\u9879\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u5143\u80fd\u591f\u8868\u793a\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u76d1\u63a7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

This limits reliability and diagnostic insight for further improvements. In this work, we investigate the explainability of the meta-models in AutoClustering. We first review 22 existing methods and organize their meta-features into a structured taxonomy. We then apply a global explainability technique (i.e., Decision Predicate Graphs) to assess feature importance within meta-models from selected frameworks. Finally, we use local explainability tools such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to analyse specific clustering decisions. Our findings highlight consistent patterns in meta-feature relevance, identify structural weaknesses in current meta-learning strategies that can distort recommendations, and provide actionable guidance for more interpretable Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) design.

Conventional machine learning approaches, such as Support Vector Machines, variants of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and tree-based methods like Random Forests, Extra Tree Regressors, and XGBoost, can capture nonlinearities but often struggle to respect the fundamental propeller law relationship between power and speed, resulting in poor extrapolation outside the training envelope. This study introduces a hybrid modeling framework that integrates physics-based knowledge from sea trials with data-driven residual learning. The baseline component, derived from calm-water power curves of the form $P = cV^n$, captures the dominant power-speed dependence, while another, nonlinear, regressor is then trained to predict the residual power, representing deviations caused by environmental and operational conditions. By constraining the machine learning task to residual corrections, the hybrid model simplifies learning, improves generalization, and ensures consistency with the underlying physics. In this study, an XGBoost, a simple Neural Network, and a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) coupled with the baseline component were compared to identical models without the baseline component. Validation on in-service data demonstrates that the hybrid model consistently outperformed a pure data-driven baseline in sparse data regions while maintaining similar performance in populated ones.

Diagnostics, such as convergence behavior or objective values, may reflect global quality, but they do not indicate whether particular instances are assigned confidently, especially for initialization-sensitive algorithms like k-means. This assignment-level instability can undermine both accuracy and robustness. Ensemble approaches improve global consistency by aggregating multiple runs, but they typically lack tools for quantifying pointwise confidence in a way that combines cross-run agreement with geometric support from the learned cluster structure. We introduce CAKE (Confidence in Assignments via K-partition Ensembles), a framework that evaluates each point using two complementary statistics computed over a clustering ensemble: assignment stability and consistency of local geometric fit. These are combined into a single, interpretable score in [0,1]. Our theoretical analysis shows that CAKE remains effective under noise and separates stable from unstable points. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets indicate that CAKE effectively highlights ambiguous points and stable core members, providing a confidence ranking that can guide filtering or prioritization to improve clustering quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAKE\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2a\u70b9\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u805a\u7c7b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u805a\u7c7b\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7ed3\u6784\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e2a\u4f53\u5206\u914d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e86\u89e3\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CAKE\uff08\u901a\u8fc7K\u5206\u533a\u96c6\u6210\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u914d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u96c6\u6210\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\uff1a\u5206\u914d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u62df\u5408\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "CAKE\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u70b9\u3002\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCAKE\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u6a21\u7cca\u70b9\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6210\u5458\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f15\u5bfc\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6216\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u805a\u7c7b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "CAKE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u70b9\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}
